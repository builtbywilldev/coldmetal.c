U||TRANSLATOR’S NOTE
U||In these days when the name of Mahatma Gandhi is identified with the momentous question of Non-Co-operation, it may come with a shock of surprise to most readers to be told that he is something of an authority on matters of Health and Disease as well. Very few of us perhaps are aware that he is the author of quite an original little Health-book in Gujarati. Those who think of him as a dreamy idealist or an unpractical visionary, with his head always in the clouds, will certainly be undeceived when they read this book replete from cover to cover with practical observations on the most practical question of Health. His views are of course radically different from the ordinary views that find expression in the pages of such books; in many cases, indeed, his doctrines must be pronounced revolutionary, and will doubtless be regarded by a certain class of readers as wholly impracticable. Even the most revolutionary of his doctrines, however, are based, not on the shifting quicksands of mere theory, but on the soli
U||d foundation of deep study, backed up by personal experience of nearly thirty years. He himself recognises that many of his views will hardly be accepted by the ordinary [Pg vi] reader, but he has felt himself impelled by a stern sense of duty to give publicity to his convictions formed after so much of study and experience. Some at least however, of those who read his book cannot help being profoundly influenced by it. Such, at any rate, has been the case with me; and I have ventured to translate the book into English in the hope that others may also be benefitted likewise.
U||I should perhaps explain that I am not a student of Gujarati, the language of the original. I have used instead one of the two Hindi versions of the book. I should also point out that I have not attempted a literal or close translation, but only a very free rendering into English. In some cases, whole passages have been omitted; and occasionally only the general sense of a passage has been given. It is hoped, however, that, in no single instance has there been a misinterpretation of the original words.
U||I am aware that many errors might have crept in, as the translation had to be done in a hurry, and there was hardly anytime for revision. I hope to make a thorough revision of the book, in case a second edition is called for.

U||INTRODUCTION
U||For more than twenty years past I have been paying special attention to the question of Health. While in England, I had to make my own arrangements for food and drink, and I can say, therefore, that my experience is quite reliable. I have arrived at certain definite conclusions from that experience, and I now set them down for the benefit of my readers.
U||As the familiar saying goes, ‘Prevention is better than cure.’ It is far easier and safer to prevent illness by the observance of the laws of health than to set about curing the illness which has been brought on by our own ignorance and carelessness. Hence it is the duty of all thoughtful men to understand aright the laws of health, and the object of the following pages is to give an account of these laws. We shall also consider the best methods of cure for some of the most common diseases.
U||As Milton says, the mind can make a hell of heaven or a heaven of hell. So heaven is not somewhere above the clouds, and hell somewhere [Pg 2] underneath the earth! We have this same idea expressed in the Sanskrit saying, Mana êva Manushayanâm Kâranam Bandha Mokshayoh—man’s captivity or freedom is dependant on the state of his mind. From this it follows that whether a man is healthy or unhealthy depends on himself. Illness is the result not only of our actions but also of our thoughts. As has been said by a famous doctor, more people die for fear of diseases like small-pox, cholera and plague than out of those diseases themselves.
U||Ignorance is one of the root-causes of disease. Very often we get bewildered at the most ordinary diseases out of sheer ignorance, and in our anxiety to get better, we simply make matters worse. Our ignorance of the most elementary laws of health leads us to adopt wrong remedies or drives us into the hands of the veriest quacks. How strange (and yet how true) it is that we know much less about things near at hand than things at a distance. We know hardly anything of our own village, but we can give by rote the names of the rivers and mountains of England! We take so much trouble to learn the names of the stars in the sky, while we hardly think it worth while to know the things that are in our own homes! We never care a jot for the splendid pageantry of Nature before our very eyes, while we are so anxious to witness the [Pg 3] puerile mummeries of the theatre! And in the same way, we are not ashamed to be ignorant of the structure of our body, of the way in which the bones and muscles, grow, how the blood cir
U||culates and is rendered impure, how we are affected by evil thoughts and passions, how our mind travels over illimitable spaces and times while the body is at rest, and so on. There is nothing so closely connected with us as our body, but there is also nothing perhaps of which our ignorance is so profound, or our indifference so complete.
U||It is the duty of every one of us to get over this indifference. Everyone should regard it as his bounden duty to know something of the fundamental facts concerning his body. This kind of instruction should indeed be made compulsory in our schools. At present, we know not how to deal with the most ordinary scalds and wounds; we are helpless if a thorn runs into our foot; we are beside ourselves with fright and dismay if we are bitten by an ordinary snake! Indeed, if we consider the depth of our ignorance in such matters, we shall have to hang down our heads in shame. To assert that the average man cannot be expected to know these things is simply absurd. The following pages are intended for such as are willing to learn.
U||I do not pretend that the facts mentioned by me have not been said before. But my readers will [Pg 4] find here in a nutshell the substance of several books on the subject. I have arrived at my conclusions after studying these books, and after a series of careful experiments. Moreover, those who are new to this subject will also be saved the risk of being confounded by the conflicting views held by writers of such books. One writer says for instance, that hot water is to be used under certain circumstances, while another writer says that, exactly under the same circumstances, cold water is to be used. Conflicting views of this kind have been carefully considered by me, so that my readers may rest assured of the reliability of my own views.
U||We have got into the habit of calling in a doctor for the most trivial diseases. Where there is no regular doctor available, we take the advice of mere quacks. We labour under the fatal delusion that no disease can be cured without medicine. This has been responsible for more mischief to mankind than any other evil. It is of course, necessary that our diseases should be cured, but they cannot be cured by medicines. Not only are medicines merely useless, but at times even positively harmful. For a diseased man to take drugs and medicines would be as foolish as to try to cover up the filth that has accumulated in the inside of the house. The more we cover up the filth, the [Pg 5] more rapidly does putrefaction go on. The same is the case with the human body. Illness or disease is only Nature’s warning that filth has accumulated in some portion or other of the body; and it would surely be the part of wisdom to allow Nature to remove the filth, instead of covering it up by the help of medicines. Those who take
U|| medicines are really rendering the task of Nature doubly difficult. It is, on the other hand, quite easy for us to help Nature in her task by remembering certain elementary principles,—by fasting, for instance, so that the filth may not accumulate all the more, and by vigorous exercise in the open air, so that some of the filth may escape in the form of perspiration. And the one thing that is supremely necessary is to keep our minds strictly under control.
U||We find from experience that, when once a bottle of medicine gets itself introduced into a home, it never thinks of going out, but only goes on drawing other bottles in its train. We come across numberless human beings who are afflicted by some disease or other all through their lives in spite of their pathetic devotion to medicines. They are to-day under the treatment of this doctor, to-morrow of that. They spend all their life in a futile search after a doctor who will cure them for good. As the late Justice Stephen (who was for some time in [Pg 6] India) said, it is really astonishing that drugs of which so little is known should be applied by doctors to bodies of which they know still less! Some of the greatest doctors of the West themselves have now come to hold this view. Sir Astley Cooper, for instance, admits that the ‘science’ of medicine is mostly mere guess-work; Dr. Baker and Dr. Frank hold that more people die of medicines than of diseases; and Dr. Masongood even goes to the extent of saying
U|| that more men have fallen victims to medicine than to war, famine and pestilence combined!
U||It is also a matter of experience that diseases increase in proportion to the increase in the number of doctors in a place. The demand for drugs has become so widespread that even the meanest papers are sure of getting advertisements of quack medicines, if of nothing else. In a recent book on the Patent Medicines we are told that the Fruit-salts and syrups, for which we pay from Rs. 2 to Rs. 5, cost to their manufacturers only from a quarter of an anna to one anna! No wonder, then, that their compositions should be so scrupulously kept a secret.
U||We will, therefore, assure our readers that there is absolutely no necessity for them to seek the aid of doctors. To those, however, who may not be willing to boycott doctors and medicines altogether, we will say, “As far as possible, possess your [Pg 7] souls in patience, and do not trouble the doctors. In case you are forced at length to call in the aid of a doctor, be sure to get a good man; then, follow his directions strictly, and do not call in another doctor, unless by his own advice. But remember, above all, that the curing of your disease does not rest ultimately in the hands of any doctor.”

U||Chapter I
U||THE MEANING OF HEALTH
U||Ordinarily that man is considered healthy who eats well and moves about, and does not resort to a doctor. But a little thought will convince us that this idea is wrong. There are many cases of men being diseased, in spite of their eating well and freely moving about. They are under the delusion that they are healthy, simply because they are too indifferent to think about the matter.
U||In fact, perfectly healthy men hardly exist anywhere over this wide world.
U||As has been well said, only that man can be said to be really healthy, who has a sound mind in a sound body. The relation between the body and the mind is so intimate that, if either of them got out of order, the whole system would suffer. Let us take the analogy of the rose-flower. Its colour stands to its fragrance in the same way as the body [Pg 10] to the mind or the soul. No one regards an artificial paper-flower as a sufficient substitute for the natural flower, for the obvious reason that the fragrance, which forms the essence of the flower, cannot be reproduced. So too, we instinctively honour the man of a pure mind and a noble character in preference to the man who is merely physically strong. Of course, the body and the soul are both essential, but the latter is far more important than the former. No man whose character is not pure can be said to be really healthy. The body which contains a diseased mind can never be anything but diseased. Hence it follows that a pure character is the foundation of
U|| health in the real sense of the term; and we may say that all evil thoughts and evil passions are but different forms of disease.
U||Thus considered, we may conclude that that man alone is perfectly healthy whose body is well formed, whose teeth as well as eyes and ears are in good condition, whose nose is free from dirty matter, whose skin exudes perspiration freely and without any bad smell, whose mouth is also free from bad smells, whose hands and legs perform their duty properly, who is neither too fat nor too thin, and whose mind and senses are constantly under his control. As has already been said, it is very hard to gain such health, but it is harder [Pg 11] still to retain it, when once it has been acquired. The chief reason why we are not truly healthy is that our parents were not. An eminent writer has said that, if the parents are in perfectly good condition their children would certainly be superior to them in all respects. A perfectly healthy man has no reason to fear death; our terrible fear of death shows that we are far from being so healthy. It is, however, the clear duty of all of us to strive for perfect health. We will
U||, therefore, proceed to consider in the following pages how such health can be attained, and how, when once attained, it can also be retained for ever.
U||Chapter II
U||THE HUMAN BODY
U||The world is compounded of the five elements,—earth, water, air, fire, and ether. So too is our body. It is a sort of miniature world. Hence the body stands in need of all the elements in due proportion,—pure earth, pure water, pure fire or sunlight, pure air, and open space. When any one of these falls short of its due proportion, illness is caused in the body.
U||The body is made up of skin and bone, as well as flesh and blood. The bones constitute the frame-work of the body; but for them we could [Pg 12] not stand erect and move about. They protect the softer parts of the body. Thus the skull gives protection to the brain, while the ribs protect the heart and the lungs. Doctors have counted 238 bones in the human body. The outside of the bones is hard, but the inside is soft and hollow. Where there is a joint between two bones, there is a coating of marrow, which may be regarded as a soft bone. The teeth, too, are to be counted among the bones.
U||When we feel the flesh at some points, we find it to be tough and elastic. This part of the flesh is known as the muscle. It is the muscles that enable us to fold and unfold our arms, to move our jaws, and to close our eyes. It is by means of the muscles, again, that our organs of perception do their work.
U||It is beyond the province of this book to give a detailed account of the structure of the body; nor has the present writer enough knowledge to give such an account. We will, therefore, content ourselves with just as much information as is essential for our present purpose.
U||The most important portion of the body is the stomach. If the stomach ceases to work even for a single moment, the whole body would collapse. The work of the stomach is to digest the food, and so to provide nourishment to the body. Its relation [Pg 13] to the body is the same as that of the steam engine to the Railway train. The gastric juice which is produced in the stomach helps the assimilation of nutritious elements in the food, the refuse being sent out by way of the intestines in the form of urine and fæces. On the left side of the abdominal cavity is the spleen, while to the right of the stomach is the liver, whose function is the purification of the blood and the secretion of the bile, which is so useful for digestion.
U||In the hollow space enclosed by the ribs are situated the heart and the lungs. The heart is between the two lungs, but more to the left than the right. There are on the whole 24 bones in the chest; the action of the heart can be felt between the fifth and the sixth rib. The lungs are connected with the windpipe. The air which we inhale is taken into the lungs through the windpipe, and the blood is purified by it. It is of the utmost importance to breathe through the nose, instead of through the mouth.
U||On the circulation of the blood depend all activities of the body. It is the blood that provides nourishment to the body. It extracts the nutritious elements out of the food, and ejects the refuse through the intestines, and so keeps the body warm. The blood is incessantly circulating all over the body, along the veins and the arteries. [Pg 14] The beatings of the pulse are due to the circulation of the blood. The pulse of a normal adult man beats some 75 times a minute. The pulses of children beat faster, while those of old men are slower.
U||The chief agency for keeping the blood pure is the air. When the blood returns to the lungs after one complete round over the body, it is impure and contains poisonous elements. The oxygen of the air which we inhale purifies this blood and is assimilated into it, while the nitrogen absorbs the poisonous matter and is breathed out. This process goes on incessantly. As the air has a very important function to perform in the body, we shall devote a separate chapter to a detailed consideration of the same.
U||Chapter III
U||AIR
U||Of the three things that are indispensable for the subsistence of man,—namely, air, water, and food—the first is the most important. Hence it is that God has created it in such large quantities as to make it available to all of us for nothing. Modern civilisation, however, has rendered even fresh air somewhat costly, for, in order to breathe fresh air, we have to go out of towns, and this means [Pg 15] expense. The residents of Bombay, for instance, distinctly improve in health in the air of Matheran or, still better, of the Malabar Hills; but they cannot go to these places without money. Hence, in these days, it would be hardly true to say that we get fresh air gratis, as we used to in the old days.
U||But, whether fresh air is available gratis or not, it is undeniable that we cannot get on without it. We have already seen that the blood circulates over the body, returns to the lungs, and after being purified, starts on its round again. We breathe out the impure air, and take in oxygen from the outside, which purifies the blood. This process of inspiration and expiration goes on for ever, and on it depends man’s life. When drowned in water we die, because, then we are unable to let out the impure air in the body and take in pure air from outside. The divers go down into the water in what is known as a diving bell, and they take in fresh air through a tube which leads to the top. Hence it is that they are able to remain under water for a long time.
U||It has been ascertained by experiments that no man can live without air for as long as five minutes. We often hear of the death of little children, when they are held so close to the bosom by ignorant mothers as to make it impossible for them to breathe.
U||[Pg 16]
U||We should all be as much against the breathing of impure air as we are against the drinking of dirty water and the eating of dirty food; but the air we breathe is, as a rule, far more impure than the water we drink or the food we eat. We are all worshippers of concrete objects; those things that can be seen and felt are regarded by us as of far greater importance than those which are invisible and intangible. Since air belongs to this latter class of objects, we fail to realise the evil wrought by the impure air that we breathe. We would think twice before eating the leavings of another man’s food, or drinking out of a cup polluted by another man’s lips. Even those who have not the least sense of shame or repugnance would never eat another man’s vomit, or drink the water which has been spat out by him; even those who are dying of hunger and thirst would refuse to do it. But, alas, how few of us realise that the air we inhale is so often the impure and poisonous air which has been exhaled by others, and
U|| which is surely no less objectionable than a man’s vomit! How strange that men should sit and sleep together for hours in closed rooms, and go on inhaling the deadly air exhaled by themselves and their companions! How fortunate for man that air should be so light and diffusive, and capable of penetrating the smallest holes! Even when the [Pg 17] doors and windows are closed, there is generally some little space between the walls and the roof, through which some air from outside manages to get in, so that the inmates of the room have not to breathe exclusively poisoned air. The air that we exhale mixes with the air outside, and is rendered pure again by an automatic process that is always going on in Nature.
U||Now we are able to understand why so many men and women should be weak and diseased. There can be absolutely no doubt that impure air is the root-cause of disease in ninety-nine cases out of every hundred. It follows that the best way of avoiding disease is to live and work in the open air. No doctor can compete with fresh air in this matter. Consumption is caused by the decay of the lungs, due to the inhaling of impure air, just as a steam engine which is filled with bad coal gets out of order. Hence doctors say that the easiest and the most effective treatment for a consumptive patient is to keep him in fresh air for all the 24 hours of the day.
U||It is, of course, essential to know how we can keep the air pure. In fact, every child should be taught the value of fresh air, as soon as it is able to understand anything. If my readers would take the trouble to learn the simple facts about the air and would put their knowledge into practice, [Pg 18] while teaching their children also to do the same. I shall feel immensely gratified.
U||Our latrines are perhaps most responsible for rendering the air impure. Very few people realise the serious harm done by dirty latrines. Even dogs and cats make with their claws something like a pit wherein to deposit their fæces, and then cover it up with some earth. Where there are no lavatories of the modern approved types, we should also do likewise. There should be kept ashes or dry earth in a tin can or an earthen vessel inside the latrine, and whoever goes into the latrine should, on coming out, cover the fæces well with the ash or the earth, as the case may be. If this is done there would be no bad smell, and the flies too will not settle on it and transmit the filth. Anybody whose sense of smell has not been wholly blunted, or who has not grown thoroughly accustomed to foul smells will know how noxious is the smell that emanates from all filthy matter which is allowed to lie open to the weather. Our gorge rises at the very thought of fæces being mixed with our food, but we go on inhaling the air 
U||which has been polluted by such foul smell, forgetting the fact that the one is just as bad as the other, except that, while the former is visible, the latter is not. We should see that our latrines are kept thoroughly neat and clean. [Pg 19] We abhor the idea of our cleaning the latrines ourselves, but what we should really abhor is the idea of making use of dirty latrines. What is the harm in ourselves removing the filth which has been expelled from inside our own body, and which we are not ashamed to have removed by others? There is absolutely no reason why we should not ourselves learn the work of scavenging and teach it to our children as well. The filthy matter should be removed, and thrown into a pit two feet deep, and then covered up with a thick layer of earth. If we go to some open place, we should dig a small pit with our hands or feet, and then cover it up, after the bowels have been evacuated.
U||We also make the air impure by making water at all places indiscriminately. This dirty habit should be given up altogether. If there is no place specially set apart for the purpose, we should go to some dry ground away from the house, and should also cover up the urine with earth.
U||The filth should not be cast into very deep pits, for, in that case, it would be beyond the reach of sun’s heat, and would also pollute the water flowing underneath the earth.
U||The habit of spitting indiscriminately on the verandahs, court yards, and such like places is also very bad. The spittle, especially of consumptives, [Pg 20] is very dangerous. The poisonous germs in it rise into the air, and, being inhaled by others, lead to a spread of the disease. We should keep a spittoon inside the house, and if we have to spit when out on the road we should spit where there is dry dust, so that the spittle may be absorbed into the dust and cause no harm. Doctors hold that the consumptive should spit into a spittoon with some disinfectant in it: for, even if he spits on dry ground, the germs in his spittle manage to rise and spread into the air along with the dust. But, in any case, there can be no doubt that the habit of spitting wherever we please is dirty as well as dangerous.
U||Some people throw where they like cooked food and other articles, which decay and render the air impure. If all such rubbish be put underground, the air would not be made impure, and good manure, too could be obtained. In fact, no kind of decaying matter should be allowed to lie exposed to the air. It is so easy for us to take this necessary precaution, if only we are in earnest about it.
U||Now we have seen how our own bad habits render the air impure, and what we can do to keep it pure. Next we shall consider how to inhale the air.
U||As already mentioned in the last chapter, the air is to be inhaled through the nose, and not [Pg 21] through the mouth. There are, however, very few persons who know how to breathe correctly. Many people are in the pernicious habit of inhaling through the mouth. If very cold air is inhaled through the mouth, we catch cold and sore throat. Further, if we inhale through the mouth, the particles of dust in the air go into the lungs and cause great mischief. In London, for instance, in November, the smoke which issues from the chimneys of great factories mixes with the dense fog, producing a kind of yellow mixture. This contains tiny particles of soot, which can be detected in the spittle of a man who inhales through the mouth. To escape this, many women (who have not learnt to breathe through the nose alone) put on a special kind of veil over their faces, which act as sieves. If these veils are closely examined, particles of dust can be detected in them. But God has given to all of us a sieve of this kind insid
U||e the nose. The air which is inhaled through the nostrils is sifted before it reaches the lungs, and is also warmed in the process. So all men should learn to breathe through the nose alone. And this is not at all difficult, if we remember to keep our mouth firmly shut at all times, except when we are talking. Those who have got into the habit of keeping their mouth open should sleep with a bandage round the mouth, [Pg 22] which would force them to breathe through the nose. They should also take some twenty long respirations in the open air, both in the morning and in the evening. In fact, all men can practise this simple exercise and see for themselves how rapidly their chest deepens. If the chest be measured at the beginning of the practice, and again after an interval of two months, it will be seen how much it has expanded in this short period.
U||After learning how to inhale the air, we should cultivate the habit of breathing fresh air, day in and day out. We are generally in the most pernicious habit of keeping confined to the house or the office throughout the day, and sleeping in narrow rooms at night, with all doors and windows shut. As far as possible, we should remain in the open air at all times. We should at least sleep on the verandah or in the open air. Those who cannot do this should at least keep the doors and windows of the room fully open at all times. The air is our food for all the twenty-four hours of the day. Why, then, should we be afraid of it? It is a most foolish idea that we catch cold by inhaling the cool breeze of the morning. Of course, those people who have spoiled their lungs by the evil habit of sleeping within closed doors are likely to catch cold, if they change their habit all on a [Pg 23] sudden. But even they should not be afraid of cold, for this cold can be speedily got rid of. Now-a-days, in Europe, the houses for
U|| consumptives are being built in such a way that they may get fresh air at all times. We know what terrible havoc is wrought in India by epidemics. We should remember that these epidemics are due to our habit of defiling the air, and of inhaling this poisonous air. We should understand that even the most delicate people will be benefitted by systematically inhaling fresh air. If we cultivate the habit of keeping the air pure and of breathing only fresh air, we can save ourselves from many a terrible disease.
U||Sleeping with the face uncovered is as essential as sleeping in fresh air. Many of our people are in the habit of sleeping with the face covered, which means that they have to inhale the poisonous air which has been exhaled by themselves. Fortunately however, some of the air from outside does find its way through the interstices of the cloth, else they should die of suffocation. But the small quantity of air that gains entrance in this way is altogether inadequate. If we are suffering from cold, we may cover the head with a piece of cloth, or put on a night-cap, but the nose should be kept exposed under all circumstances.
U||Air and light are so intimately connected with each other that it is as well to speak a few words [Pg 24] here on the value of light. Light is as indispensable to life as air itself. Hence it is that Hell is represented as completely dark. Where light cannot penetrate, the air can never be pure. If we enter a dark cellar, we can distinctly perceive the smell of the foul air. The fact that we cannot see in the dark shows that God has intended us to live and move in the light. And Nature has given us just as much darkness as we require in the night. Yet, many people are in the habit of sitting or sleeping in underground cellars, devoid of air and light, even in the hottest summer! Those who thus deprive themselves of air and light are always weak and haggard.
U||Now-a-days, there are many doctors in Europe who cure their patients by means of air-bath and sun-bath alone. Thousands of diseased persons have been cured by mere exposure to the air and to the sunlight. We should keep all doors and windows in our houses always open, in order to allow the free entrance of air and light.
U||Some readers may ask why, if air and light are so indispensable, those who live and work in cellars are not visibly affected. Those who have thought well over the matter would never put this question. Our aim should be to attain the maximum of health by all legitimate means; we should not be content merely to live anyhow. It has been [Pg 25] indubitably established that insufficient air and light give rise to disease. Dwellers in towns are, as a rule, more delicate than those in the country, for they get less air and light than the latter. Air and light, then, are absolutely indispensable to health, and every one should remember all that we have said on the matter, and act up to it to the best of his ability.
U||Chapter IV
U||WATER
U||As has been already pointed out, air is the most indispensable to our subsistence, while water comes next in order. Man cannot live for more than a few minutes without air, but he can live for a few days without water. And in the absence of other food, he can subsist on water alone for many days. There is more than 70% of water in the composition of our food-stuffs, as in that of the human body.
U||Even though water is so indispensable, we take hardly any pains to keep it pure. Epidemics are as much the outcome of our indifference to the quality of the water we drink, as of the air we breathe. The drinking of dirty water very often produces also the disease of the stone.
U||Water may be impure in either of two ways,—by issuing from dirty places, or by being defiled by us. [Pg 26] Where the water issues from dirty places, we should not drink it at all; nor do we generally drink it. But we do not shrink from drinking the water which has been defiled by ourselves. River-water, for instance, is regarded as quite good for drinking, although we throw into it all sorts of rubbish, and also use it for washing purposes. We should make it a rule never to drink the water in which people bathe. The upper portion of a river should be set apart for drinking water, the lower being reserved for bathing and washing purposes. Where there is no such arrangement, it is a good practice to dig in the sand, and take drinking water therefrom. This water is very pure, since it has been filtered by passage through the sand. It is generally risky to drink well-water, for unless it is well protected, the dirty water at the top would trickle down into the well, and render the water impure. Further, birds
U|| and insects often fall into the water and die; sometimes birds build their nests inside the wells; and the dirt from the feet of those who draw water from the well is also washed down into the water. For all these reasons, we should be particularly careful in drinking well-water. Water kept in tubs is also very often impure. If it should be pure, the tubs should be washed clean at frequent intervals, and should be kept covered; we should also see that the tank or [Pg 27] well from which the water is taken is kept in good condition. Very few people, however, take such precautions to keep the water pure. Hence the best way of removing the impurities of the water is to boil it well, and, after cooling it, filter it carefully into another vessel through a thick and clean piece of cloth. Our duty, however, does not end with this. We should realise that we owe a duty to our fellowmen in this matter. We should see to it that we do absolutely nothing to defile the water which is used for drinking by the public. We 
U||should scrupulously refrain from bathing or washing in the water which is reserved for drinking; we should never answer the calls of nature near the banks of a river, nor cremate the dead bodies there and throw the ashes after cremation into the water.
U||In spite of all the care that we may take, we find it so difficult to keep water perfectly pure. It may have, for instance, salt dissolved in it, or bits of grass and other decaying matter. Rain water is, of course, the purest, but, before it reaches us, it generally becomes impure by the absorption of the floating matter in the atmosphere. Perfectly pure water has a most beneficial effect on the system; hence doctors administer distilled water to their patients. Those who are suffering from constipation are appreciably benefitted by the use of distilled water.
U||[Pg 28]
U||Many people do not know that water is of two kinds, soft and hard. Hard water is water in which some kind of salt has been dissolved. Hence, soap does not readily lather in it, and food cannot be easily boiled in it. Its taste is brackish, while soft water tastes sweet. It is much safer to drink soft water, although some people hold that hard water is better by virtue of the presence of nutritious matter dissolved therein. Rain water is the best kind of soft water, and is therefore, the best for drinking purposes. Hard water, if boiled and kept over the fire for some half an hour, is rendered soft. Then it may be filtered and drunk.
U||The question is often asked, “When should one drink water, and how much?” The only safe answer to this is this: one should drink water only when one feels thirsty, and even then only just enough to quench the thirst. There is no harm in drinking water during the meals or immediately afterwards. Of course, we should not wash the food down with water. If the food refuses to go down of itself, it means that either it has not been well prepared or the stomach is not in need of it.
U||Ordinarily, there is no need to drink water; and indeed, there should be none. As already mentioned, there is a large percentage of water in our ordinary articles of food, and we also add water in [Pg 29] cooking them. Why then should we feel thirsty? Those people whose diet is free from such articles as chillies and onions which create an artificial thirst, have rarely any need to drink water. Those who feel unaccountably thirsty must be suffering from some disease or other.
U||We may be tempted to drink any kind of water that we come across, simply because we see some people doing it with impunity. The reply to this has already been given in connection with air. Our blood has in itself the power of destroying many of the poisonous elements that enter into it, but it has to be renewed and purified, just as the sharp edge of a sword has to be mended when it has been once employed in action. Hence, if we go on drinking impure water, we should not be surprised to find our blood thoroughly poisoned in the end.
U||Chapter V
U||FOOD
U||It is impossible to lay down hard and fast rules in the matter of food. What sort of food should we eat, how much of it should be eaten, and at what times,—these are questions on which doctors differ a great deal. The ways of men are so diverse, that the very same food shows different effects on different individuals.
U||[Pg 30]
U||Although, however, it is impossible to say conclusively what sort of food we should eat, it is the clear duty of every individual to bestow serious thought on the matter. Needless to say, the body cannot subsist without food. We undergo all sorts of sufferings and privations for the sake of food. But, at the same time, it is indisputable that 99.9% of men and women in the world eat merely to please the palate. They never pause to think of the after-effects at the time of eating. Many people take purgatives and digestive pills or powders in order to be able to eat thoroughly well. Then there are some people who, after eating to the utmost of their capacity, vomit out all that they have eaten, and proceed to eat the same stuffs once more! Some people, indeed, eat so sumptuously that, for two or three days together, they do not feel hungry at all. In some cases, men have even been known to have died of over-eating. I say all this from my own experience. When I think of my old days, I am tempted to laugh at many
U|| things, and cannot help being ashamed of some things. In those days I used to have tea in the morning, breakfast two or three hours afterwards, dinner at one o’clock, tea again at 3 p.m., and supper between 6 and 7! My condition at that time was most pitiable. There was a great deal of superfluous fat on my body, and bottles of [Pg 31] medicine were always at hand. In order to be able to eat well, I used to take purgatives very often, as well as some tonic or other. In those days, I had not a third of my present capacity for work, in spite of the fact that I was then in the prime of youth. Such a life is surely pitiable, and if we consider the matter seriously, we must also admit it to be mean, sinful and thoroughly contemptible.
U||Man is not born to eat, nor should he live to eat. His true function is to know and serve his Maker; but, since the body is essential to this service, we have perforce to eat. Even atheists will admit that we should eat merely to preserve our health, and not more than is needed for this purpose.
U||Turn to the birds and beasts, and what do you find? They never eat merely to please the palate, they never go on eating till their inside is full to overflowing. On the other hand, they eat only to appease their hunger, and even then only just as much as will appease their hunger. They take the food provided by Nature, and do not cook their food. Can it be that man alone is created to worship the palate? Can it be that he alone is destined to be eternally suffering from disease? Those animals that live a natural life of freedom never once die of hunger. Among them there are no distinctions of rich and poor,—of those who eat many times a day, and those who do not get even one [Pg 32] meal in the day. These abnormalities are found only among us human beings,—and yet we regard ourselves as superior to the animal creation! Surely those who spend their days in the worship of their stomach are worse than the birds and beasts.
U||A calm reflection will show that all sins like lying, cheating and stealing are ultimately due to our subjection to the palate. He who is able to control the palate, will easily be able to control the other senses. If we tell lies, or commit theft or adultery, we are looked down upon by society, but, strangely enough, no odium attaches to those who slavishly pander to the palate! It would seem as though this were not a question of morality at all! The fact is that even the best of us are slaves to the palate. No one has yet adequately emphasised the numberless evils that arise from our habit of pandering to the palate. All civilised people would boycott the company of liars, thieves, and adulterers; but they go on eating beyond all limits, and never regard it as a sin at all. Pandering to the palate is not regarded by us as a sin, since all of us are guilty of it, just as dacoity is not regarded as a crime in a village of dacoits; but what is worse, we pride ourselves on it! On occasions of marriage and othe
U||r festivities, we regard it as a sacred duty to worship the palate; even in times of funeral, we are not ashamed of doing it. [Pg 33] Has a guest come? We must gorge him with sweetmeats. If, from time to time, we do not give feasts to our friends and relations, or do not partake of the feasts given by them, we must become objects of contempt. If, having invited our friends to eat with us, we fail to cram them with rich stuffs, we must be regarded as miserly. On holidays, of course, we must have specially rich food prepared! Indeed, what is really a great sin has come to be looked upon as a sign of wisdom! We have sedulously cultivated such false notions in the matter of eating that we never realise our slavishness and our beastliness. How can we save ourselves from this terrible state?
U||Let us view the question from another standpoint. We find it invariably the case in the world that Nature herself has provided for all creatures, whether man or beast, or bird or insect, just enough food for their sustenance. This is an eternal law of Nature. In the kingdom of Nature, none goes to sleep, none forgets to do his duty, and none shows a tendency to laziness. All the work is done to perfection, and punctually to the minute. If we remember to order our lives strictly in accordance with the immutable and eternal laws of Nature, we shall find that there are no more deaths by starvation anywhere over the wide world. Since Nature always provides just enough food to feed all created beings, it follows [Pg 34] that he who takes to himself more than his normal share of food, is depriving another of his legitimate share. Is it not a fact, that, in the kitchens of emperors and kings, of all rich men, in general, much more food is prepared than is required to feed them and all their dependents? That is to s
U||ay, they snatch so much food from the share of the poor. Is it, then, any wonder that the poor should die of starvation? If this is true (and this fact has been admitted by the most thoughtful men) it must necessarily follow that all the food that we eat beyond our immediate need is food filched from the stomachs of the poor. And to the extent to which we eat merely with a view to pleasing the palate must our health necessarily suffer. After this preliminary discussion, we can proceed to consider what kind of food is best for us.
U||Before, however, we decide the question of the ideal food for us, we have to consider what kinds of food are injurious to health, and to be avoided. Under the term “food”, we include all the things that are taken into the body through the mouth,—including wine, bhang and opium, tobacco, tea, coffee and cocoa, spices and condiments. I am convinced that all these articles have to be completely eschewed, having been led to this conviction partly from my own experience, and partly from the experiences of others.
U||[Pg 35]
U||Wine, bhang and opium have been condemned by all the religions of the world, although the number of total abstainers is so limited. Drink has brought about the ruin of whole families. The drunkard forfeits his sanity; he has even been known to forget the distinction between mother, wife and daughter. His life becomes a mere burden to him. Even men of sound sense become helpless automatons when they take to drink; even when not actually under its influence, their minds are too impotent to do any work. Some people say that wine is harmless when used as medicine, but even European doctors have begun to give up this view in many cases. Some partisans of drink argue that, if wine can be used as medicine with impunity, it can also be used as drink. But many poisons are employed as medicines; do we ever dream of employing them as food? It is quite possible that, in some diseases, wine may do some good, but even then, no sensible, or thoughtful man should consent to use it even as medicine, under any circumstances. 
U||As for opium, it is no less injurious than wine, and is to be equally eschewed. Have we not seen a mighty nation like the Chinese falling under the deadly spell of opium, and rendering itself incapable of maintaining its independence? Have we not seen the jagirdars of our own land forfeiting their jagirs under the same fatal influence?
U||[Pg 36]
U||So powerful is the spell that has been woven over the minds of men by tobacco that it will take an age to break it. Young and old have equally come under this fatal spell. Even the best men do not shrink from the use of tobacco. Its use, indeed, has become a matter of course with us, and is spreading wider and wider every day. Very few people are aware of the many tricks employed by the cigarette-manufacturers to bring us more and more under its influence. They sprinkle opium or some perfumed acid on the tobacco, so that we may find it all the more difficult to extricate ourselves from its clutches. They spend thousands of pounds in advertisements. Many European firms dealing in cigars keep their own presses, have their own cinemas, institute lotteries, and give away prizes, and, in short, spend money like water to achieve their end. Even women have now begun to smoke. And poems have been composed on tobacco, extolling it as the great friend of the poor!
U||The evils of smoking are too numerous to mention. The habitual smoker becomes such a bond slave to it that he knows no sense of shame or compunction; he proceeds to emit the foul fumes even in the houses of strangers! It is also a matter of common experience that smokers are often tempted to commit all sorts of crimes. Children [Pg 37] steal money from their parents’ purses; and even the prisoners in gaols manage to steal cigarettes and keep them carefully concealed. The smoker will get on without food, but he cannot dispense with his smoke! Soldiers on the field of battle have been known to lose all capacity for fighting for failure of the indispensable cigarette at the critical moment.
U||The late Count Leo Tolstoi of Russia tells us the following story. A certain man once took it into his head, for some reason, to murder his wife. He actually drew the knife and was about to do the deed, when he felt some compunction, and gave it up. Then he sat down to smoke and his wits being turned under the influence of tobacco, he rose once more and actually committed the murder. Tolstoi held the view that the poison of tobacco is more subtle and irresistible, and hence far more dangerous, than that of wine.
U||Then the money that is spent on cigars and cigarettes by individuals is frightfully large. I have myself come across instances of cigars consuming as much as Rs. 75 a month for one man!
U||Smoking also leads to an appreciable reduction of digestive powers. The smoker feels no appetite for food, and in order to give it some flavour, spices and condiments have to be freely used. His breath stinks, and, in some cases, blisters are formed on [Pg 38] his face, and the gums and teeth turn black in colour. Many also fall a prey to terrible diseases. The fumes of tobacco befoul the air around, and public health suffers in consequence. I cannot understand how those who condemn drink can have the temerity to defend smoking. The man who does not eschew tobacco in all its forms can never be perfectly healthy, nor can he be a man of pure and blameless character.
U||I must say that tea, coffee and cocoa are equally injurious to health, although I know that very few are likely to agree with me. There is a kind of poison in all of them; and, in the case of tea and coffee, if milk and sugar were not added, there would be absolutely no nutritious element in them. By means of repeated and varied experiments it has been established that there is nothing at all in these articles which is capable of improving the blood. Until a few years ago, we used to drink tea and coffee only on special occasions, but to-day they have become universally indispensable. Things have come to such a pass that even sickly persons often use them as substitutes for nourishing food!
U||Fortunately for us, the costliness of cocoa has prevented its spread to the same extent as tea and coffee, although, in the homes of the rich, it is quite liberally used.
U||[Pg 39]
U||That all these three articles are poisonous can be seen from the fact that those who once take to them can never afterwards get on without them. In the old days, I myself used to feel a distinct sense of weariness or langour if I did not get my tea punctually at the usual hour. Once some 400 women and children had gathered together at a certain celebration. The executive committee had resolved against providing tea to the visitors. The women, however, that had assembled there, were in the habit of taking tea at 4 o’clock every evening. The authorities were informed that, if these women were not given their usual tea, they would be too ill to move about, and, needless to say, they had to cancel their original resolution! But some slight delay in the preparation of the tea led to a regular uproar, and the commotion subsided only after the women had had their cup of tea! I can vouch for the authenticity of this incident. In another instance, a certain woman had lost all her digestive powers under the influenc
U||e of tea, and had become a prey to chronic headaches; but from the moment that she gave up tea her health began steadily to improve. A doctor of the Battersea Municipality in England has declared, after careful investigation, that the brain-tissues of thousands of women in his district have been diseased from excessive use of tea. I have myself [Pg 40] come across many instances of health being ruined by tea.
U||Coffee does some good against Kapha (phlegm) and Vatha (‘wind’), but at the same time it weakens the body by destroying the vital fluid, and by making the blood as thin as water. To those people who advocate coffee on the ground that it is beneficial against “phlegm” and “wind”, we would recommend the juice of ginger as even better for the purpose. And, on the other hand, let us remember that the evil effects of coffee are too serious to be counter-balanced by its good. When the blood and the vital fluid are poisoned by a stuff, can there be any hesitation in giving it up altogether?
U||Cocoa is fully as harmful as coffee, and it contains a poison which deadens the perceptions of the skin.
U||Those people who recognise the validity of moral considerations in these matters should remember that tea, coffee and cocoa are prepared mostly by labourers under indenture, which is only a fine name for slavery. If we saw with our own eyes the oppressive treatment that is meted out to the labourers in cocoa plantations, we should never again make use of the stuff. Indeed, if we enquire minutely into the methods of preparation of all our articles of food, we shall have to give up 90% of them!
U||A harmless and healthy substitute for coffee (tea [Pg 41] or cocoa) can be prepared as follows. Even habitual coffee-drinkers will be unable to perceive any difference in taste between coffee and this substitute. Good and well-sifted wheat is put into a frying-pan over the fire and well fried, until it has turned completely red, and begun to grow dark in colour. Then it is powdered just like coffee. A spoon of the powder is then put into a cup, and boiling water poured on to it. Preferably keep the thing over the fire for a minute, and add milk and sugar, if necessary, and you get a delicious drink, which is much cheaper and healthier than coffee. Those who want to save themselves the trouble of preparing this powder may get their supply from the Satyagraha Ashram, Ahmedabad.
U||From the point of view of diet, the whole mankind may be divided into three broad divisions. (1) The first class, which is the largest, consists of those who, whether by preference or out of necessity, live on an exclusive vegetable diet. Under this division come the best part of India, a large portion of Europe, and China and Japan. The staple diet of the Italians is macaroni, of the Irish potato, of the Scotch oatmeal, and of the Chinese and Japanese rice. (2) The second class consists of those who live on a mixed diet. Under this class come most of the people of England, the [Pg 42] richer classes of China and Japan, the richer Mussalmans of India, as well as those rich Hindus who have no religious scruples about taking meat. (3) To the third class belong the uncivilised peoples of the frigid zones, who live on an exclusive meat diet. These are not very numerous, and they also introduce a vegetable element into their diet, wherever they come in contact with the civilised races of Europe. Man, then, can li
U||ve on three kinds of diet; but it is our duty to consider which of these is the healthiest for us.
U||An examination of the structure of the human body leads to the conclusion that man is intended by Nature to live on a vegetable diet. There is the closest affinity between the organs of the human body and those of the fruit-eating animals. The monkey, for instance, is so similar to man in shape and structure, and it is a fruit-eating animal. Its teeth and stomach are just like the teeth and stomach of man. From this we may infer that man is intended to live on roots and fruits, and not on meat.
U||Scientists have found out by experiments that fruits have in them all the elements that are required for man’s sustenance. The plantain, the orange, the date, the grape, the apple, the almond, the walnut, the groundnut, the cocoanut,—all these fruits contain a large percentage of nutritious [Pg 43] elements. These scientists even hold that there is no need for man to cook his food. They argue that he should be able to subsist very well on food cooked by the Sun’s warmth, even as all the lower animals are able to do; and they say that the most nutritious elements in the food are destroyed in the process of cooking, and that those things that cannot be eaten uncooked could not have been intended for our food by Nature.
U||If this view be correct, it follows that we are at present wasting a lot of our precious time in the cooking of our food. If we could live on uncooked food alone, we should be saving so much time and energy, as well as money, all of which may be utilised for more useful purposes.
U||Some people will doubtless say that it is idle and foolish to speculate on the possibility of men taking to uncooked food, since there is absolutely no hope of their ever doing it. But we are not considering at present what people will or will not do, but only what they ought to do. It is only when we know what the ideal kind of diet is that we shall be able more and more to approximate our actual to the ideal. When we say that a fruit-diet is the best, we do not, of course, expect all men to take to it straightway. We only mean that, if they should take to this diet, it would be the best thing for them.
U||[Pg 44]
U||There are many men in England who have tried a pure fruit-diet, and who have recorded the results of their experience. They were people who took to this diet, not out of religious scruples, but simply out of considerations of health. A German doctor has written a bulky volume on the subject, and established the value of a fruit-diet by many arguments and evidences. He has cured many diseases by a fruit-diet combined with open-air life. He goes so far as to say that the people of any country can find all the elements of nutrition in the fruits of their own land.
U||It may not be out of place to record my own experience in this connection. For the last six months I have been living exclusively on fruits—rejecting even milk and curd. My present dietary consists of plantain, groundnut and olive oil, with some sour fruit like the lime. I cannot say that my experiment has been altogether a success, but a period of six months is all too short to arrive at any definite conclusions on such a vital matter as a complete change of diet. This, however, I can say, that, during this period, I have been able to keep well where others have been attacked by disease, and my physical as well as mental powers are now greater than before. I may not be able to lift heavy loads, but I can now do hard labour for a much longer time without fatigue. I can also do [Pg 45] more mental work, and with better persistence and resoluteness. I have tried a fruit-diet on many sickly people, invariably with great advantage. I shall describe these experiences in the section on diseases. Here I will only
U|| say that my own experience, as well as my study of the subject, has confirmed me in the conviction that a fruit-diet is the best for us.
U||As I have already confessed, I do not think for a moment that people will take to a fruit-diet as soon as they read this. It may even be that all that I have written has no effect at all on a single reader, but I believe it to be my bounden duty to set down what I hold to be the right thing to the best of my light.
U||If however, anybody does wish to try a fruit-diet, he should proceed rather cautiously in order to obtain the best results. He should carefully go through all the chapters of this book, and fully grasp the fundamental principles, before he proceeds to do anything in practice. My request to my readers is that they should reserve their final judgments until they have read through all that I have got to say.
U||A vegetable diet is the best after a fruit-diet. Under this term we include all kinds of pot-herbs and cereals, as well as milk. Vegetables are not as nutritious as fruits, since they lose part of their [Pg 46] efficacy in the process of cooking. We cannot, however, eat uncooked vegetables. We will now proceed to consider which vegetables are the best for us.
U||Wheat is the best of all the cereals. Man can live on wheat alone, for in it we have in due proportion all the elements of nutrition. Many kinds of edibles can be made of wheat, and they can all be easily digested. The ready-made foods for children that are sold by chemists are also made partly of wheat. Millet and maize belong to the same genus, and cakes and loaves can also be made out of them, but they are inferior to wheat in their food-value. We will now consider the best form in which wheat may be taken. The white “mill flour” that is sold in our bazars is quite useless; it contains no nutriment at all. An English doctor tells us that a dog which was fed solely on this flour died, while other dogs which were fed on better flour remained quite healthy. There is a great demand for loaves made of this flour, since men eat merely to satisfy their palate, and are rarely moved by considerations of health. These loaves are devoid of taste and nutriment, as well as of softness. They become so hard that the
U||y cannot be broken by the hand. The best form of flour is that which is made of well-sifted wheat in the grind-mill at home. This flour should be used [Pg 47] without further sifting. Loaves made of it are quite sweet to the taste, as well as quite soft. It also lasts for a longer time than the “mill flour”, since it is far more nutritious, and may be used in smaller quantities.
U||The loaf sold in the bazars is thoroughly useless. It may be quite white and attractive in appearance, but it is invariably adulterated. The worst of it is that it is made by fermentation. Many persons have testified from experience that fermented dough is harmful to health. Further, these loaves being made by besmearing the oven with fat, they are objectionable to Hindu as well as Mussalman sentiment. To fill the stomach with these bazar loaves instead of preparing good loaves at home is at best a sign of indolence.
U||Another and an easier way of taking wheat is this. Wheat is ground into coarse grain, which is then well cooked and mixed with milk and sugar. This gives a very delicious and healthy kind of food.
U||Rice is quite useless as a food. Indeed, it is doubtful if men can subsist upon mere rice, to the exclusion of such nutritious articles as dhall, ghee and milk. This is not the case with wheat, for man can retain his strength by living on mere wheat boiled in water.
U||We eat the pot-herbs mainly for their taste. As [Pg 48] they have laxative powers, they help to purify the blood up to a limit. Yet they are but varieties of grass, and very hard to digest. Those who partake too much of them have flabby bodies; they suffer very often from indigestion, and go about in search of digestive pills and powders. Hence, if we take them at all, we should do so in moderation.
U||All the many varieties of pulse are very heavy, and hard of digestion. Their merit is that those who eat them do not suffer from hunger for a long time; but they also lead to indigestion in most cases. Those who do hard labour may be able to digest them, and derive some good out of them. But we who lead a sedentary life should be very chary of eating them.
U||Dr. Haig, a celebrated writer in England, tells us, on the basis of repeated experiments, that the pulses are injurious to health, since they generate a kind of acid in the system, which leads to several diseases, and a premature old age. His arguments need not be given here, but my own experience goes to confirm his view. Those, however, who are unable or unwilling to eschew the pulses altogether, should use them with great caution.
U||Almost everywhere in India, the spices and condiments are freely used, as nowhere else in the whole world. Even the African negroes dislike the taste of our masala, and refuse to eat food [Pg 49] mixed with it. And if the Whites eat masala, their stomach gets out of order, and pimples also appear on their faces, as I have found from my own experience. The fact is that masala is by no means savoury in itself, but we have so long been accustomed to its use that its flavour appeals to us. But, as has been already explained, it is wrong to eat anything for its mere taste.
U||How comes it, then, that masala is so freely eaten by us? Admittedly, in order to help the digestion, and to be able to eat more. Pepper, mustard, coriander and other condiments have the power of artificially helping the digestion, and generating a sort of artificial hunger. But it would be wrong to to infer from this that all the food has been thoroughly digested, and assimilated into the system. Those who take too much of masala are often found to suffer from anaemia, and even from diarrhea. I know a man who even died in the prime of youth out of too much eating of pepper. Hence it is quite necessary to eschew all condiments altogether.
U||What has been said of masala applies also to salt. Most people would be scandalised at this suggestion, but it is a fact established by experience. There is a school in England who even hold the view that salt is more harmful than most condiments. As there is enough of salt in the composition of the vegetables we use, we need not [Pg 50] put any extra salt into them. Nature herself has provided just as much salt as is required for the upkeep of our health. All the extra salt that we use is quite superfluous; all of it goes out of the body again in the form of perspiration, or in other ways, and no portion of it seems to have any useful function to perform in the body. One writer even holds that salt poisons the blood. He says that those who use no salt at all have their blood so pure that they are not affected even by snake-bite. We do not know if this is a fact or not, but this much we know from experience, that, in several diseases like piles and asthama, the disuse of salt at once produces appreciably ben
U||eficial results. And, on the other hand, I have not come across a single instance of a man being any the worse for not using salt. I myself left off the use of salt two years ago, and I have not only not suffered by it, but have even been benefitted in some respects. I have not now to drink as much water as before, and am more brisk and energetic. The reason for my disuse of salt was a very strange one: for it was occasioned by the illness of somebody else! The person whose illness led to it did not get worse after that, but remained in the same condition; and it is my faith that, if only the diseased person himself had given up the use of salt, he would have recovered completely.
U||[Pg 51]
U||Those who give up salt will also have to give up vegetables and dhall. This is a very hard thing to do, as I have found from many tests. I am convinced that vegetables and dhall cannot be properly digested without salt. This does not, of course, mean that salt improves the digestion, but it only appears to do so, just as pepper does, although ultimately it leads to evil consequences. Of course, the man who entirely gives up the use of salt may feel out of sorts for a few days; but, if he keeps up his spirits, he is bound to be immensely benefitted in the long run.
U||I make bold to regard even milk as one of the articles to be eschewed! This I do on the strength of my own experience which, however, need not be described here in detail. The popular idea of the value of milk is a pure superstition, but it is so deep-rooted that it is futile to think of removing it. As I have said more than once, I do not cherish the hope that my readers will accept all my views; I do not even believe that all those who accept them in theory will adopt them in practice. Nevertheless, I think it my duty to speak out what I believe to be the truth, leaving my readers to form their own judgments. Many doctors hold the view that milk gives rise to a kind of fever, and many books have been written in support of this view. The disease bearing germs that live in the air rapidly gain an [Pg 52] entrance into the milk, and render it poisonous, so that it is very difficult to keep milk in a state of perfect purity. In Africa elaborate rules have been laid down for the conduct of the dairies, saying h
U||ow the milk should be boiled and preserved, how the vessels should be kept clean, and so on. When so much pains have to be taken in this matter, it is certainly to be considered how far it is worth while to employ milk as an article of food.
U||Moreover, the purity or otherwise of the milk depends upon the cow’s food, and the state of its health. Doctors have testified to the fact that those who drink the milk of consumptive cows fall a prey to consumption themselves. It is very rare to come across a cow that is perfectly healthy. That is to say, perfectly pure milk is very hard to obtain, since it is tainted at its very source. Everybody knows that a child that sucks the breast of its mother contracts any disease that she might be suffering from. And often when a little child is ill, medicine is administered to its mother, so that its effect might reach the child through the milk of her breast. Just in the same way, the health of the man who drinks the milk of a cow will be the same as that of the cow itself. When the use of milk is fraught with so much danger, would it not be the part of wisdom [Pg 53] to eschew it altogether, especially when there are excellent substitutes? Olive oil, for instance serves this purpose to some extent; and sweet 
U||almond is a most efficient substitute. The almond is first soaked in hot water, and its husk removed. Then it is well crushed, and mixed thoroughly well with water. This gives a drink which contains all the good properties of milk, and is at the same time free from its evil effects.
U||Now let us consider this question from the point of view of Natural law. The calf drinks its mother’s milk only until its teeth have grown; and it begins to eat as soon as it has its teeth. Clearly, this is also what man is intended to do. Nature does not intend us to go on drinking milk after we have ceased to be infants. We should learn to live on fruits like the apple and the almond, or on wheat roti, after we have our teeth. Although this is not the place to consider the saving in money that might be effected by giving up milk, it is certainly a point to be kept in mind. Nor is there any need for any of the articles produced from milk. The sourness of lime is quite a good substitute for that of buttermilk; and as for ghee, thousands of Indians manage with oil even now.
U||A careful examination of the structure of the human body shows that meat is not the natural food of man. Dr. Haig and Dr. Kingsford have [Pg 54] very clearly demonstrated the evil effects of meat on the body of man. They have shown that meat generates just the same kind of acid in the body as the pulses. It leads to the decay of the teeth, as well as to rheumatism; it also gives rise to evil passions like anger, which, as we have already seen, are but forms of disease.
U||To sum up, then, we find that those who live on fruits alone are very rare, but it is quite easy to live on a combination of fruits, wheat and olive oil, and it is also eminently conducive to sound health. The plantain comes easy first among the fruits; but the date, the grape, the plum and the orange, to name only a few, are all quite nourishing, and may be taken along with the roti. The roti does not suffer in taste by being besmeared with olive oil. This diet dispenses with salt, pepper, milk and sugar, and is quite simple and cheap. It is, of course, foolish to eat sugar for its own sake. Too much sweetmeat weakens the teeth, and injures the health. Excellent edibles can be made of wheat and the fruits, and a combination of health and taste secured.
U||The next question to consider is how much food should be taken, and how many times a day. But, as this is a subject of vital importance, we will devote a separate chapter to it.
U||[Pg 55]
U||Chapter VI
U||HOW MUCH AND HOW MANY TIMES SHOULD WE EAT?
U||There is a great divergence of opinion among doctors as to the quantity of food that we should take. One doctor holds that we should eat to the utmost of our capacity, and he has calculated the quantities of different kinds of food that we can take. Another holds the view that the food of labourers should differ in quantity as well as in quality from that of persons engaged in mental work, while a third doctor contends that the prince and the peasant should eat exactly the same quantity of food. This much, however, will be generally admitted, that the weak cannot eat just as much as the strong. In the same way, a woman eats less than a man, and children and old men eat less than young men. One writer goes so far as to say that, if only we would masticate our food thoroughly well, so that every particle of it is mixed with the saliva, then we should not have to eat more than five or ten tolas of food. This he says on the basis of numberless experiments, and his book has been sold in thousands. All this shows 
U||that it is futile to think of prescribing the quantity of food for men.
U||Most doctors admit that 99% of human beings eat more than is needed. Indeed, this is a fact of [Pg 56] everyday experience, and does not require to be proclaimed by any doctor. There is no fear at all of men ruining their health by eating too little; and the great need is for a reduction in the quantity of food that we generally take.
U||As said above, it is of the utmost importance to masticate the food thoroughly well. By so doing, we shall be able to extract the maximum of nutriment from the minimum of food. Experienced persons point out that the fæces of a man whose food is wholesome, and who does not eat too much, will be small in quantity, quite solid and smooth, dark in colour, and free from all foul smell. The man who does not have such fæces should understand that he has eaten too much of unwholesome food, and has failed to masticate it well. Also, if a man does not get sleep at night, or if his sleep be troubled by dreams, and if his tongue be dirty in the morning, he should know that he has been guilty of excessive eating. And if he has to get up several times at night to make water, it means that he has taken too much liquid food at night. By these and other tests, every man can arrive at the exact quantity of food that is needed for him. Many men suffer from foul breath, which shows that their food has not been well digested. 
U||In many cases, again, too much eating gives rise to pimples on the face, and in the nose; and many [Pg 57] people suffer from wind in the stomach. The root of all these troubles is, to put it plainly, that we have converted our stomach into a latrine, and we carry this latrine about with us. When we consider the matter in a sober light, we cannot help feeling an unmixed contempt for ourselves. If we want to avoid the sin of over-eating, we should take a vow never to have anything to do with feasts of all kinds. Of course, we should feed those who come to us as guests, but only so as not to violate the laws of health. Do we ever think of inviting our friends to clean their teeth with us, or to take a glass of water? Is not eating as strictly a matter of health as these things? Why, then, should we make so much fuss about it? We have become such gluttons by habit that our tongues are ever craving for abnormal sensations. Hence we think it a sacred duty to cram our guests with rich food, and we cherish the hope
U|| that they will do likewise for us, when their turn comes! If, an hour after eating, we ask a clean-bodied friend to smell our mouth, and if he should tell us his exact feelings, we should have to hide our heads in utter shame! But some people are so shameless that they take purgatives soon after eating, that they might be able to eat still more or they even vomit out what they have eaten in order to sit down again to the feast at once!
U||[Pg 58]
U||Since even the best of us are more or less guilty of over-eating, our wise forefathers have prescribed frequent fasts as a religious duty. Indeed, merely from the point of view of health, it will be highly beneficial to fast at least once a fortnight. Many pious Hindus take only one meal a day during the rainy season. This is a practice based upon the soundest hygienic principles. For, when the air is damp and the sky cloudy, the digestive organs are weaker than usual, and hence there should be a reduction in the quantity of food.
U||And now we will consider how may meals we may take in the day. Numberless people in India are content with only two meals. Those who do hard labour take three meals, but a system of four meals has arisen after the invention of English medicines! Of late, several societies have been formed in England and in America in order to exhort the people to take only two meals a day. They say that we should not take a breakfast early in the morning, since our sleep itself serves the purpose of the breakfast. As soon as we get up in the morning we should prepare to work rather than to eat. We should take our meal only after working for three hours. Those who hold these views take only two meals a day, and do not even take tea in the interval. An experienced doctor by name Deway has written an excellent book on [Pg 59] Fasting, in which he has shown the benefits of dispensing with the breakfast. I can also say from my experience that there is absolutely no need to eat more than twice, for a man who has passed the period 
U||of youth, and whose body has attained its fullest growth.
U||Chapter VII
U||EXERCISE
U||Exercise is as much of a vital necessity for man as air, water and food, in the sense that no man who does not take exercise regularly, can be perfectly healthy. By “exercise” we do not mean merely walking, or games like hockey, football, and cricket; we include under the term all physical and mental activity. Exercise, even as food, is as essential to the mind as to the body. The mind is much weakened by want of exercise as the body, and a feeble mind is, indeed, a form of disease. An athlete, for instance, who is an expert in wrestling, cannot be regarded as a really healthy man, unless his mind is equally efficient. As already explained, “a sound mind in a sound body” alone constitutes true health.
U||Which, then, are those exercises which keep the body and the mind equally efficient? Indeed, Nature has so arranged it that we can be engaged [Pg 60] in physical as well as mental work at the same time. The vast majority of men on earth live by field-labour. The farmer has to do strenuous bodily exercise at any cost, for he has to work for 8 or 10 hours, or sometimes even more, in order to earn his bread and clothing. And efficient labour is impossible unless the mind is also in good condition. He has to attend to all the many details of cultivation; he must have a good knowledge of soils and seasons, and perhaps also of the movements of the sun, the moon, and the stars. Even the ablest men will be beaten by the farmer in these matters. He knows the state of his immediate surroundings thoroughly well, he can find the directions by looking at the stars in the night, and tell a great many things from the ways of birds and beasts. He knows, for instance, that rain is about to fall when a particular class of bir
U||ds gather together, and begin to make noise. He knows as much of the earth and the sky as is necessary for his work. As he has to bring up his children, he must know something of Dharma Sastra. Since he lives under the broad open sky, he easily realises the greatness of God.
U||Of course, all men cannot be farmers, nor is this book written for them. We have however, described the life of the farmer, as we are convinced that it is the natural life for man. To the extent [Pg 61] to which we deviate from these natural conditions must we suffer in health. From the farmer’s life we learn that we should work for at least 8 hours a day, and it should involve mental work as well.
U||Merchants and others leading a sedentary life have indeed, to do some mental work, but their work is too one-sided and too inadequate to be called exercise.
U||For such people the wise men of the West have devised games like cricket and football, and such minor games as are played at parties and festive gatherings. As for mental work the reading of such books as involve no mental strain is prescribed. No doubt these games do give exercise to the body, but it is a question if they are equally beneficial to the mind. How many of the best players of football and cricket are men of superior mental powers? What have we seen of the mental equipment of those Indian Princes who have earned a distinction as players? On the other hand, how many of the ablest men care to play these games? We can affirm from our experience that there are very few players among those who are gifted with great mental powers. The people of England are extremely fond of games, but their own poet, Kipling, speaks very disparagingly of the mental capacity of the players.
U||Here in India, however, we have chosen quite a [Pg 62] different path! Our men do arduous mental work, but give little or no exercise to the body. Their bodies are enfeebled by excessive mental strain, and they fall a prey to serious diseases; and just when the world expects to benefit by their work, they bid it eternal farewell! Our work should be neither exclusively physical nor exclusively mental, nor such as ministers merely to the pleasure of the moment. The ideal kind of exercise is that which gives vigour to the body as well as to the mind; only such exercise can keep a man truly healthy, and such a man is the farmer.
U||But what shall he do who is no farmer? The exercise which games like the cricket give is too inadequate, and something else has to be devised. The best thing for ordinary men would be to keep a small garden near the house, and work in it for a few hours every day. Some may ask, “What can we do if the house we live in be not our own?” This is a foolish question to ask, for, whoever may be the owner of the house, he cannot object to his ground being improved by digging and cultivation. And we shall have the satisfaction of feeling that we have helped to keep somebody else’s ground neat and clean. Those who do not find time for such exercise or who may not like it, may resort to walking, which is the next best exercise. Truly has this been described as the Queen of all exercises. [Pg 63] The main reason why our Sadhus and Fakirs are strong as a class is that they go about from one end of the country to the other only on foot. Thoreau, the great American writer, has said many remarkable things on walking a
U||s an exercise. He says that the writings of those who keep indoors and never go out into the open air, will be as weak as their bodies. Referring to his own experience, he says that all his best works were written when he was walking the most. He was such an inveterate walker that four or five hours a day was quite an ordinary thing with him! Our passion for exercise should become so strong that we cannot bring ourselves to dispense with it on any account. We hardly realise how weak and futile is our mental work when unaccompanied by hard physical exercise. Walking gives movement to every portion of the body, and ensures vigorous circulation of the blood; for, when we walk fast, fresh air is inhaled into the lungs. Then there is the inestimable joy that natural objects give us, the joy that comes from a contemplation of the beauties of nature. It is, of course, useless to walk along lanes and streets, or to take the same path every day. We should go out into the fields and forests where we can have a taste o
U||f Nature. Walking a mile or two is no walking at all; at least ten or twelve miles are necessary for exercise. [Pg 64] Those who cannot walk so much every day can at least do so on Sundays. Once a man who was suffering from indigestion went to the doctor to take medicine. He was advised to walk a little every day, but he pleaded that he was too weak to walk at all. Then the doctor took him into his carriage for a drive. On the way he deliberately dropped his whip, and the sick man, out of courtesy, got down to take it. The doctor, however, drove on without waiting for him, and the poor man had to trudge behind the carriage. When the doctor was satisfied that he had walked long enough, he took him into the carriage again, and explained that it was a device adopted to make him walk. As the man had begun to feel hungry by this time, he realised the value of the doctor’s advice, and forgot the affair of the whip. He then went home and had a hearty meal. Let those who are suffering from indigestion and kindred 
U||diseases try for themselves, and they will at once realise the value of walking as an exercise.
U||Chapter VIII
U||DRESS
U||Dress is also a matter of health to a certain extent. European ladies, for instance, have such queer notions of beauty that their dress is contrived [Pg 65] with a view to straitening the waist and the feet, which, in its turn, leads to several diseases. The feet of Chinese women are deliberately straitened to such an extent that they are smaller even than the feet of our little children, and, as a result, their health is injured. These two instances show how the health may be affected by the nature of the dress. But the choice of our dress does not rest always in our hands, for we have perforce to adopt the manners of our elders. The chief object of dress has been forgotten, and it has come to be regarded as indicative of a man’s religion, country, race and profession. In this state of things, it is very difficult to discuss the question of dress strictly from the point of view of health, but such a discussion must necessarily do us good. Under the term dress, we include all such things as boots and shoes
U||, as well as jewellery and the like.
U||What is the chief object of dress? Man in his primitive state had no dress at all; he went about naked, and exposing almost the whole body. His skin was firm and strong, he was able to stand sun and shower, and never once suffered from cold and kindred ailments. As has already been explained, we inhale the air not only through the nostrils, but also through the numberless pores of the skin. So when we cover the body with clothing, we are [Pg 66] preventing this natural function of the skin. But when the people of the colder countries grew more and more indolent, they began to feel the need to cover their bodies. They were no longer able to stand the cold, and the use of dress came into being, until at length it came to be looked upon not merely as a necessity, but as an ornament. Subsequently it has also come to be regarded as an indication of country, race etc.
U||In fact, Nature herself has provided an excellent covering for us in our skin. The idea that the body looks unseemly in undress is absurd, for the very best pictures are those that display the naked body. When we cover up the most ordinary parts of our body, it is as though we felt ashamed of them in their natural condition, and as though we found fault with Nature’s own arrangement. We think it a duty to go on multiplying the trappings and ornaments for our body, as we grow richer and richer. We ‘adorn’ our body in all sorts of hideous ways, and pride ourselves on our handsomeness! If our eyes were not blinded by foolish habit, we should see that the body looks most handsome only in its nakedness, as it enjoys its best health only in that condition. Dress, indeed, detracts from the natural beauty of the body. But, not content with dress alone, man began to wear jewels also. This is mere madness, [Pg 67] for it is hard to understand how these jewels can add an iota to the body’s natural beauty. But w
U||omen have gone beyond all bounds of sense or decency in this matter. They are not ashamed to wear anklets which are so heavy that they can hardly lift their feet, or to pierce their nose and ears hideously for putting on rings, or to stud their wrists and fingers with rings and bracelets of several kinds. These ornaments only serve to help the accumulation of dirt in the body; there is indeed no limit to the dirt on the nose and ears. We mistake this filthiness for beauty, and throw money away to secure it; and we do not even shrink from putting our lives at the mercy of thieves. There is no limit to the pains we take to satisfy the silly notions of vanity that we have so sedulously cultivated. Women, indeed, have become so infatuated that they are not prepared to remove the ear-ring even if the ears are diseased; even if the hand is swollen and suffering from frightful pain, they would not remove the bracelets; and they are unwilling to remove the ring from a swollen finger, since they imagine that their be
U||auty would suffer by so doing!
U||A thorough reform in dress is by no means an easy matter, but it is surely possible for all of us to renounce our jewels and all superfluous clothing. We may keep some few things for the sake of [Pg 68] convention, and throw off all the rest. Those who are free from the superstition that dress is an ornament can surely effect many changes in their dress, and keep themselves in good health.
U||Now-a-days the notion has gained ground that European dress is necessary for maintaining our decency and prestige! This is not the place to discuss this question in detail. Here it will be enough to point out that, although the dress of Europeans might be good enough for the cold countries of Europe, it is hopelessly unsuited to India. Indian dress, alone, can be good for Indians, whether they be Hindu or Musalman. Our dress being loose and open, air is not shut out; and being white for the most part, it does not absorb the heat. Black dress feels hot, since all the sun’s rays are absorbed into it, and, in its turn, into the body.
U||The practice of covering the head with the turban has become quite common with us. Nevertheless we should try to keep the head bare as far as possible. To grow the hair, and to dress it by combing and brushing, parting in the middle and so on, is nothing short of barbarous. Dust and dirt, as well as nits and lice, accumulate in the hair, and if a boil were to arise on the head, it cannot be properly treated. Especially for those who use a turban, it would be stupid to grow the hair.
U||[Pg 69]
U||The feet also are common agents of disease. The feet of those who wear boots and shoes grow dirty, and begin to exude a lot of stinking perspiration. So great is the stink that those who are sensitive to smells will hardly be able to stand by the side of one who is removing his shoes and socks. Our common names for the shoe speak of it as the “protector of the feet” and the “enemy of the thorn” showing that shoes should be worn only when we have to walk along a thorny path, or over very cold or hot ground, and that only the soles should be covered, and not the entire feet. And this purpose is served excellently well by the sandal. Some people who are accustomed to the use of shoes often suffer from headaches, of pain in the feet, or weakness of the body. Let them try the experiment of walking with bare feet, and then they will at once find out the benefit of keeping the feet bare, and free from sweat by exposure to the air.
U||Chapter IX
U||SEXUAL RELATIONS
U||I would specially request those who have carefully read through the book so far to read through this chapter with even greater care, and ponder well over its subject-matter. There are still several [Pg 70] more chapters to be written, and they will, of course, be found useful in their own way. But not one of them is nearly as important as this. As I have already said, there is not a single matter mentioned in this book which is not based on my personal experience, or which I do not believe to be strictly true.
U||Many are the keys to health, and they are all quite essential; but the one thing needful, above all others, is Brahmacharya. Of course, pure air, pure water, and wholesome food do contribute to health. But how can we be healthy if we expend all the health that we acquire? How can we help being paupers if we spend all the money that we earn? There can be no doubt that men and women can never be virile or strong unless they observe true Brahmacharya.
U||What do we mean by Brahmacharya? We mean by it that men and women should refrain from enjoying each other. That is to say, they should not touch each other with a carnal thought, they should not think of it even in their dreams. Their mutual glances should be free from all suggestion of carnality. The hidden strength that God has given us should be conserved by rigid self-discipline, and transmitted into energy and power,—not merely of body, but also of mind and soul.
U||But what is the spectacle that we actually see [Pg 71] around us? Men and women, old and young, without exception, are seen entangled in the coils of sensuality. Blinded by lust, they lose all sense of right and wrong. I have myself seen even boys and girls behaving like mad men under its fatal influence. I too have behaved likewise under similar influences, and it could not well be otherwise. For the sake of a momentary pleasure, we sacrifice in an instant all the stock of vitality that we have accumulated. The infatuation over, we find ourselves in a miserable condition. The next morning, we feel hopelessly weak and tired, and the mind refuses to do its work. Then, we try to remedy the mischief by taking all sorts of ‘nervine tonics’ and put ourselves under the doctor’s mercy for repairing the waste, and for recovering the capacity for enjoyment. So the days pass and the years, until at length old age comes upon us, and finds us utterly emasculated in body and in mind.
U||But the law of Nature is just the reverse of this. The older we grow, the keener should grow our intellect also; the longer we live, the greater should be our capacity to transmit the fruits of our accumulated experience to our fellowmen. And such is indeed the case with those who have been true Brahmacharies. They know no fear of death, and they do not forget good even in the [Pg 72] hour of death; nor do they indulge in vain complaints. They die with a smile on their lips, and boldly face the day of judgment. They are the true men and women; and of them alone can it be said that they have conserved their health.
U||We hardly realise the fact that incontinence is the root-cause of all the vanity, anger, fear and jealousy in the world. If our mind is not under our control, if we behave once or more every day more foolishly than even little children, what sins may we not commit consciously or unconsciously? How can we pause to think of the consequences of our actions, however vile or sinful they may be?
U||But you may ask, “Who has ever seen a true Brahmachary in this sense? If all men should turn Brahmacharies, would not humanity be extinct, and the whole world go to rack and ruin?” We will leave aside the religious aspect of this question, and discuss it simply from the secular point of view. To my mind, these questions only bespeak our weakness and our cowardliness. We have not the strength of will to observe Brahmacharya, and, therefore, set about finding pretexts for evading our duty. The race of true Brahmacharies is by no means extinct; but, if they were to be had merely for the asking, of what value would Brahmacharya be? Thousands of hardy labourers have to go and dig deep into the bowels of the earth in search of [Pg 73] diamonds, and at length they get perhaps merely a handful of them out of heaps and heaps of rock. How much greater, then, should be the labour involved in the discovery of the infinitely more precious diamond of a Brahmachary? If the observance of Brahmacharya should mean the rui
U||n of the world, why should we regret it? Are we God that we should be so anxious about its future? He who created it will surely see to its preservation. It is none of our business to enquire if other people practise Brahmacharya or not. When we turn merchant or lawyer or doctor, do we ever pause to consider what the fate of the world would be if all men were to do likewise? The true Brahmachary will, in the long run, discover for himself answers to such questions.
U||But how can men engrossed by the cares of the material world put these ideas into practice? What shall the married people do? What shall they do who have children? And what shall be done by those people who cannot control their lust? The best solution for all such difficulties has already been given. We should keep this ideal constantly before us, and try to approximate to it more and more to the utmost of our capacity. When little children are taught to write the letters of the alphabet, we show them the perfect shapes of the letters, and they try to reproduce them as [Pg 74] best they can. Just in the same way, if we steadily work up to the ideal of Brahmacharya, we may ultimately succeed in realising it. What if we have married already? The law of Nature is that Brahmacharya may be broken only when the husband and wife feel a strong desire for a child. Those who, remembering this law, violate Brahmacharya once in four or five years cannot be said to be slaves to lust, nor can they appreciably lose their s
U||tock of vitality. But, alas, how rare are those men and women who yield to the sexual craving merely for the sake of an offspring! The vast majority, who may be numbered in thousands, turn to sexual enjoyment merely to satisfy their carnal passion, with the result that children are born to them quite against their will. In the madness of sexual passion, we give no thought to the consequences of our acts. In this respect, men are even more to blame than women. The man is blinded so much by his lust that he never cares to remember that his wife is weak and incapable of rearing a child. In the West indeed, people have trespassed even against the claims of common decency. They indulge in sexual pleasures, and devise measures in order to evade the responsibilities of parenthood. Many books have been written on this subject, and a regular trade is being carried on in providing the means of [Pg 75] preventing conception. We are as yet free from this sin, but we do not shrink from imposing the heavy burden of matern
U||ity on our women, and we are not concerned even to find that our children are weak, impotent and imbecile. Every time we get children, we bless Providence, and so seek to hide from ourselves the wickedness of our acts. Should we not rather deem it a sign of God’s anger to have children who are weak, sensual, crippled and impotent? Is it a matter for joy that mere boys and girls should have children? Is it not rather a curse of God? We all know that the premature fruit of a too young plant weakens the parent, and so we try all means of delaying the appearance of fruit. But we sing hymns of praise and thanks-giving to God when a child is born of a boy-father and a girl-mother! Could anything be more dreadful? Do we think that the world is going to be saved by the countless swarms of such impotent children endlessly multiplying in India or elsewhere in the world? Verily we are, in this respect, far worse than even the lower animals; for, the bull and the cow are brought together solely with the object of havi
U||ng a calf. Man and woman should regard it as sacred duty to keep apart from the moment of conception up to the time when the child has ceased to suck its mother’s breast. But we go on in our merry fashion blissfully forgetful [Pg 76] of this sacred obligation. This incurable disease enfeebles our mind and leads us to an early grave, after making us drag a miserable existence for a short while. Married people should understand the true function of marriage, and should not violate the law of Brahmacharya except with a view to having a child for the continuation of the race.
U||But this is so difficult under our present conditions of life. Our diet, our ways of life, our common talk, and our environments are all equally calculated to rouse and keep alive our sensual appetite; and sensuality is like a poison, eating into our vitals. Some people may doubt the possibility of our being able to free ourselves from this bondage. This book is written not for those who go about with such doubtings of heart, but only for those who are really in earnest, and who have the courage to take active steps for their improvement. Those who are quite content with their present abject condition may even be offended to read all this; but I hope this will be of some service to those who are heartily disgusted with their own miserable existence.
U||From all that has been said, it follows that those who are still unmarried should try to remain so; but, if they cannot help marrying, they should do so as late as possible. Young men, for instance, [Pg 77] should take a vow to remain unmarried till the age of 25 or 30. We shall not explain here all the benefits other than physical that result from this; but those who want to enjoy them can do so for themselves.
U||My request to those parents who may read these pages is that they should not tie a mill-stone round the necks of their sons by marrying them in their teens. They should look also to the welfare of their sons, and not only to their own interests. They should throw aside all silly notions of caste-pride or ‘respectability’, and cease to indulge in such heartless practices. Let them, rather, if they are true well-wishers of their children, look to their physical, mental and moral improvements. What greater disservice can they do to their sons than compelling them to enter upon a married life, with all its tremendous responsibilities and cares, even while they are mere boys?
U||Then again, the true laws of health demand that the man that loses his wife, as well as the woman that loses her husband, should remain single ever after. There is a difference of opinion among doctors as to whether young men and women need ever let their vital fluid escape, some answering the question in the affirmative, others in the negative. But this cannot justify our taking advantage of it for sensual enjoyment. I can affirm, without [Pg 78] the slightest hesitation, from my own experience as well as that of others, that sexual enjoyment is not only not necessary for the preservation of health, but is positively detrimental to it. All the strength of body and mind that has taken long to acquire, is lost altogether by the escape of the vital fluid, and it takes a long time to regain this lost strength, and even then there is no saying that it can be thoroughly recovered. A broken vessel may be made to do its work after mending, but it can never be anything but a broken vessel.
U||As has already been pointed out, the preservation of our vitality is impossible without pure air, pure water, pure and wholesome food, as well as pure thoughts. So vital indeed is the relation between our health and the life that we lead that we can never be perfectly healthy unless we lead a clean life. The earnest man who, forgetting the errors of the past, begins to live a life of purity will be able to reap the fruit of it straightway. Those who have practised true Brahmacharya even for a short period will have seen how their body and mind improve steadily in strength and power, and they will not, at any cost, be willing to part with this treasure. I have myself been guilty of lapses even after having fully understood the value of Brahmacharya, and have, of course, paid dearly for it. I am filled with shame and remorse [Pg 79] when I think of the terrible contrast between my condition before and after these lapses. But from the errors of the past I have now learnt to preserve this treasure in tact, and I
U|| fully hope, with God’s grace, to continue to preserve it in the future; for I have in my own person, witnessed the inestimable benefits of Brahmacharya. I was married early in life, and had become the father of children as a mere youth. When, at length, I awoke to the reality of my situation, I found myself sunk in the lowest depths of degradation. I shall consider myself amply rewarded for writing these pages if at least a single reader is able to take warning from my failings and experiences, and to profit thereby. Many people have told me (and I also believe it) that I am full of energy and enthusiasm, and that my mind is by so means weak; some even accuse me of rashness. There is disease in my body as well as in my mind; nevertheless, when compared with my friends, I may call myself perfectly healthy and strong. If even after twenty years of sensual enjoyment, I have been able to reach this state, how much better should I have been if only I had kept myself pure during those twenty years as well? It i
U||s my full conviction that, if only I had lived a life of Brahmacharya all through, my energy and enthusiasm would have been a thousandfold greater and I should have been [Pg 80] able to devote them all to the furtherance of my country’s cause as of my own. If this can be affirmed of an ordinary man like myself, how much more wonderful must be the gain in power,—physical, mental, as well as moral—that unbroken Brahmacharya can bring to us!
U||When so strict is the law of Brahmacharya, what shall we say of those guilty of the unpardonable sin of illegitimate sexual enjoyment? The evil that arises from adultery and prostitution is a vital question of religion and morality and cannot be fully dealt with in a treatise on health. Here we are only concerned to point out how thousands who are guilty of these sins are afflicted by syphilis and other unmentionable diseases. The inflexible decree of Providence happily condemns these wretches to a life of unmitigated suffering. Their short span of life is spent in abject bondage to quacks in a futile quest after a remedy that will rid them of their suffering. If there were no adultery at all, there would be no work for at least 50% of doctors. So inextricably indeed has venereal disease caught mankind in its clutches that even the best doctors have been forced to admit that, so long as adultery and prostitution continue, there is no hope for the human race. The medicines for these diseases are so poisonous 
U||that, although they may appear to have done some good [Pg 81] for the time being, they give rise to other and still more terrible diseases which are handed down from generation to generation.
U||In concluding this chapter, we will briefly point out how married people can preserve their Brahmacharya intact. It is not enough to observe the laws of health as regards air, water and food. The man should altogether cease to sleep in privacy with his wife. Little reflection is needed to show that the only possible motive for privacy between man and wife is the desire for sexual enjoyment. They should sleep apart at night, and be incessantly engaged in good works during the day. They should read such books as fill them with noble thoughts and meditate over the lives of great men, and live in the constant realisation of the fact that sensual enjoyment is the root of all disease. Whenever they feel a prompting for enjoyment, they should bathe in cold water, so that the heat of passion may be cooled down, and be refined into the energy of virtuous activity. This is a hard thing to do, but we have been born into this world that we might wrestle with difficulties and temptations, and conquer them; and he who has
U|| not the will to do it can never enjoy the supreme blessing of true health.

U||PART II
U||SOME SIMPLE TREATMENTS
U||Chapter I
U||AIR-TREATMENT
U||We have now done with the discussion of the foundations of health, as well as the means of its preservation. If all men and women were to obey all the laws of health, and practice strict Brahmacharya, there would be no need at all for the chapters which follow, for such men and women would then be free from all ailments, whether of the body or of the mind. But where can such men and women be found? Where are they who have not been afflicted by disease? The more strictly, however, we observe the laws which have been explained in this book, the more shall we be free from disease. But when diseases do attack us, it is our duty to deal with them properly, and the following chapters are intended to show how to do it.
U||Pure air, which is so essential to the preservation of health, is also essential to the cure of diseases. [Pg 84] If, for instance, a man who is suffering from gout is treated with air heated by steam, he perspires profusely, and his joints are eased. This kind of vapour-treatment is known as “Turkish Bath.”
U||If a man who is suffering from high fever is stripped naked, and made to sleep in the open air, there is an immediate fall in the temperature, and he feels a distinct relief. And if, when he feels cold, he is wrapped in a blanket, he perspires at once, and the fever ceases. But what we generally do is just the reverse of this. Even if the patient is willing to remain in the open air, we close all the doors and windows of the room in which he lies, and cover his whole body (including the head and ears) with blankets, with the result that he is frightened, and is rendered still weaker. If the fever is the outcome of too much heat, the sort of air-treatment described above is perfectly harmless, and its effect can be instantly felt. Of course, care should be taken that the patient does not begin to shiver in the open air. If he cannot remain naked, he may well be covered with blankets.
U||Change of air is an effective remedy for latent fever and other diseases. The common practice of taking a change of air is only an application of the principle of air-treatment. We often change our residence in the belief that a house constantly [Pg 85] infested by disease is the resort of evil spirits. This is a mere delusion, for the real “evil spirits” in such cases are the foul air inside the house. A change of residence ensures a change of air, and with it the cure of the diseases brought on by it. Indeed, so vital is the relation between health and air that the good or evil effects of even a slight change are instantaneously felt. For a change of air the rich can afford to go to distant places, but even the poor can go from one village to another, or at least from one house to another. Even a change of room in the same house often brings great relief to a sick man. But, of course, care should be taken to see that the change of air is really for the better. Thus, for instance, a disease that has bee
U||n brought on by damp air cannot be cured by a change to a damper locality. It is because sufficient attention is not paid to simple precautions like this that a change of air is often so ineffectual.
U||This chapter has been devoted to some simple instances of the application of air to the treatment of disease, while the chapter on Air in Part I of this book contains a general consideration of the value of pure air to health. Hence I would request my readers to read these two chapters side by side.
U||[Pg 86]
U||Chapter II
U||WATER-CURE
U||Since air is invisible, we cannot perceive the wonderful way in which it does its work. But the work of water and its curative effects can be easily seen and understood.
U||All people know something of the use of steam as a curative agent. We often employ it in cases of fever, and very often severe headaches can be cured only by its application. In cases of rheumatic pain in the joints, rapid relief is obtained by the use of steam followed by a cold bath. Boils and ulcers not cured by simple dressing with ointments can be completely healed by the application of steam.
U||In case of extreme fatigue, a steam-bath or a hot-water bath immediately followed by a cold bath will be found very effective. So too, in cases of sleeplessness, instant relief is often obtained by sleeping in the open air after a steam-bath followed by a cold bath.
U||Hot water can always be used as a substitute for steam. When there is severe pain in the stomach, instant relief is obtained by warming with a bottle filled with boiling water placed over a thick cloth wrapped round the waist. Whenever there is a desire to vomit, it can be done by drinking plenty of hot water. Those who are suffering from constipation often derive great benefit by drinking [Pg 87] a glass of hot water either at bedtime or soon after rising and cleaning the teeth in the morning. Sir Gordon Spring attributed his excellent health to the practice of drinking a glass of hot water every day before going to bed and after getting up in the morning. The bowels of many people move only after taking tea in the morning, and they foolishly suppose that it is the tea which has produced this effect. But, as a matter of fact, tea only does harm, and it is really the hot water in the tea that moves the bowels.
U||A special kind of cot is often used for steam-baths, but it is not quite essential. A spirit or kerosine oil stove, or a wood or coal fire, should be kept burning under an ordinary cane chair. Over the fire should be placed a vessel of water with the mouth covered; and over the chair a sheet or blanket is so spread that it may hang down in the front and protect the patient from the heat of the fire. Then the patient should be seated in the chair and wrapped round with sheets or blankets. Then the vessel should be uncovered, so that the patient may be exposed to the steam issuing from it. Our common practice of covering the head also of the patient is a needless precaution. The heat of the steam presses through the body right up to the head, and gives rise to profuse perspiration on the face. If the patient is too weak to sit up, [Pg 88] he may be made to lie down on a cot with interstices, taking care to see that none of the steam escapes. Of course, care should also be taken to see that the patient’s clot
U||hes or the blankets used do not catch fire; and due consideration should be paid to the state of the patient’s health, as an inconsiderate application of steam is fraught with danger. The patient, indeed, feels weak after a steam bath, but this weakness does not last long. Too frequent use of steam, however, enfeebles the constitution, and it is of the highest importance to apply steam with due deliberation. Steam may also be applied to any single part of the body; in cases of headache, for instance, there is no need to expose the whole body to the steam. The head should be held just over a narrow-mouthed jar of boiling water, and wrapped round with a cloth. Then the steam should be inhaled through the nose so that it may ascend into the head. If the nasal passage is blocked, it will also be opened by this process. Likewise, if there be inflamation in any part of the body, it alone need be exposed to the steam.
U||Very few realise the curative value of cold water, in spite of the fact that it is even more valuable in this respect than hot water, and can be made use of by even the weakest persons. In fever, small-pox, and skin-diseases, the application of a sheet dipped [Pg 89] in cold water is very beneficial, and often produces startling results; and anybody may try it without the least risk. Dizziness or delirium can be instantly relieved by tying round the head a cloth dipped in melted ice. People suffering from constipation often derive great benefit by tying round the stomach for some time a piece of cloth dipped in melted ice. Involuntary seminal discharges can also be often prevented by the same means. Bleeding in any part of the body may be stopped by the application of a bandage dipped in ice-cold water. Bleeding from the nose is stopped by pouring cold water over the head. Nasal diseases, cold and headache, may be cured by drawing pure cold water up the nose. The water may be drawn through one nostril and di
U||scharged through the other, or drawn through both nostrils and discharged through the mouth. There is no harm in the water going even into the stomach provided the nostrils are clean. And indeed, this is the best way to keep the nostrils clean. Those who are unable to draw the water up the nostrils may use a syringe, but after a few attempts, it can be done quite easily. All should learn to do this, since it is very simple, and at the same time a most effective remedy against headaches, bad smells in the nose, as well as dirty accumulations in the nasal passage.
U||[Pg 90]
U||Many people are afraid of taking an enema, and some even think that the body is weakened by it; but such fears are baseless. There is no more effective means of producing an instant evacuation of the bowels. It has proved effective in many diseases where all other remedies have been futile; it thoroughly cleans the bowels, and prevents the accumulation of poisonous matter. If those who suffer from rheumatic complaints or indigestion or pains caused by an unhealthy condition of the bowels take an enema of 2 lbs. of water, they would see how instantaneous is its effect. One writer on this subject says that once he was suffering from chronic indigestion and, all remedies proving futile; he had grown emaciated, but the application of the enema at once restored him his appetite, and altogether cured him of his complaint in a few days. Even ailments like jaundice can be cured by the application of the enema. If the enema has to be frequently employed, cold water should be used, for the repeated use of hot water is
U|| likely to enfeeble the constitution.
U||Dr. Louis Kuhne of Germany has, after repeated experiments, arrived at the conclusion that water-cure is the best for all diseases. His books on this subject are so popular that they are now available in almost all the languages of the world, including those of India. He contends that the abdomen is [Pg 91] the seat of all diseases. When there is too much heat in the abdomen, it manifests itself in the form of fever, rheumatism, eruptions on the body, and the like. The efficacy of water-cure had, indeed, been recognised by several people long before Kuhne, but it was he who, for the first time, pointed out the common origin of all diseases. His views need not be accepted by us in their entirety, but it is an undoubted fact that his principles and methods have proved effective in many diseases. To give only one instance out of many that have come within my experience, in a bad case of rheumatism, a thorough cure was effected by Kuhne’s system, after all other remedies had been tried, and had proved utterly 
U||ineffectual.
U||Dr. Kuhne holds that the heat in the abdomen abates by the application of cold water, and has, therefore, prescribed the bathing of the abdomen and the surrounding parts with thoroughly cold water. And for the greater convenience of bathing, he has devised a special kind of tin bath. This, however, is not quite indispensable; the tin tubs of an oval shape and of different sizes to suit people of different heights, available in our bazaars, will do equally well. The tub should be filled three-fourths with cold water, and the patient should seat himself in it in such a fashion that his feet and the upper part of the body remain outside the [Pg 92] water, and the rest of the body up to the hips inside it. The feet may preferably be placed on a low foot-stool. The patient should sit in the water quite naked, but, if he feels cold, the feet and the upper part of the body should be covered with a blanket. If a shirt is worn, it should be kept entirely outside the water. The bath should be taken in a room where the
U||re is plenty of fresh air and light. The patient should then slowly rub (or cause to be rubbed) the abdomen with a small rough towel from 5 to 30 minutes or more. The effect is instantly felt in most cases. In cases of rheumatism, the wind in the stomach escapes in the form of eructations and the like, and in cases of fever, the thermometre falls by one or two degrees. The bowels are readily cleaned by this process; fatigue disappears; sleeplessness is removed, and extreme drowsiness gives place to vigour. This contrariness of result is more apparent than real; for want of sleep, and the excess of it, are both brought on by the same cause. So too, dysentery and constipation, which are both the outcome of indigestion, are cured by this method. Piles of long standing can also be got rid of by this bath, with proper regulation of diet. Those who are troubled by the necessity for constant spitting should at once resort to this treatment for a cure. By its means the weak can become [Pg 93] strong; and even chroni
U||c rheumatism has been cured by it. It is also an effective remedy for haemorrhages, headaches, and blood-poisoning. Kuhne prescribes it as an invaluable remedy even for diseases like the cancer. A pregnant woman who takes to it regularly will have an easy child-birth. In short, all persons, without distinction of age or sex, can take to it with advantage.
U||There is another kind of bath, known as the "Wet-Sheet-Pack", which is an unfailing remedy for various diseases. This bath is taken in the following manner. A table or chair is placed in the open air, big enough to allow of the patient lying on it at full length. On it are spread (hanging on either side) some four blankets, less or more according to the state of the weather. Over them are spread two white thick sheets well dipped in cold water, and a pillow is placed under the blankets at one end. Then the patient is stripped naked (with the exception of a small waist-cloth, if he so wishes), and made to lie down on the sheets, with his hands placed in the arm-pits. Then the sheets and blankets are, one after another, wrapped round his body, taking care that the parts hanging under the feet are well tucked in so as to cover them. If the patient is exposed to the sun, a wet cloth is put over his head and face, keeping the nose always open. At first [Pg 94] the patient will experience some shivering, but this 
U||will soon give place to an agreeably warm sensation. He can lie in this position from 5 minutes to an hour or more. After a time he begins to perspire, or at times falls asleep. Soon after coming out of the sheets he should bathe in cold-water. This is an excellent remedy for small-pox and fever, and skin-diseases like the itch, the ringworm, and pimples and blotches. Even the worst forms of chicken-pox and small-pox are completely cured by this process. People can easily learn to take the “Wet-Sheet-Pack” themselves, and to apply it to others, and can thus see for themselves its wonderful effect. As the whole dirt of the body sticks to the sheets in the process of taking this bath, they ought not to be used again without being well washed in boiling water.
U||Needless to say, the full benefit of these baths cannot be derived unless the rules already mentioned as to diet, exercise and the like are strictly observed. If a rheumatic patient, for instance, were to take to Kuhne’s bath or to the “Wet-Sheet-Pack,” while eating unwholesome food, living in impure air, and neglecting his exercise, how can he possibly derive any good out of it? It is only when accompanied by strict observance of all the laws of health that water-cure can be of any effect; [Pg 95] and when so employed, its effects are sure and immediate.
U||Chapter III
U||THE USE OF EARTH
U||We will now proceed to describe the curative properties of earth, which are, in some cases, even more remarkable than those of water. That earth should have such properties need not cause us any surprise, for our own body is compounded of the earthly element. Indeed, we do make use of earth as a purifying agent. We wash the ground with earth to remove bad smells, we put it over decaying matter to prevent the pollution of the air, we wash our hands with it, and even employ it to clean the private parts. Yogis besmear their bodies with it; some people use it as a cure for boils and ulcers; and dead bodies are buried in the earth so that they may not vitiate the atmosphere. All this shows that earth has many valuable properties as a purifying and curative agent.
U||Just as Dr. Kuhne has devoted special attention to the subject of water-cure, another German doctor has made a special study of earth and its properties. He goes so far as to say that it can be used with success in the treatment of even the most complicated diseases. He says that once in a case of [Pg 96] snake-bite, where everybody else had given up the man for dead, he restored him to life by causing him to be covered up with earth for some time. There is no reason to doubt the veracity of this report. It is well known that great heat is generated in the body by burying it in the earth; and although we cannot explain how exactly the effect is produced, it is undeniable that earth does possess the property of absorbing the poison. Indeed, every case of snake-bite may not be cured in this way; but it should certainly be tried in every case. And I can say from my own experience that, in cases of scorpion-sting and the like, the use of mud is particularly beneficial.
U||I have myself tried with success the following forms of earth-cure. Constipation, dysentery, and chronic stomach-ache have been cured by the use of a mud-poultice over the abdomen for two or three days. Instant relief has been obtained in cases of headache by applying a mud-bandage round the head. Sore eye has also been cured by the same method; hurts of all kinds, whether accompanied by inflammation or not, have been healed likewise. In the old days I could not keep well without a regular use of Eno’s Fruit-salt and the like. But, since 1904, when I learnt the value of earth-cure, I have had not a single occasion to use them. A mud-poultice over the abdomen and [Pg 97] the head, gives distinct relief in a state of high fever. Skin-diseases like the itch, the ringworm, and boils, have been cured with the use of mud, though no doubt ulcers from which pus issues are not so easily cured. Burns and scalds are likewise healed by mud, which also prevents inflammation. Piles, too, are cured by the same treatment.
U|| When the hands and feet become red and swollen owing to frost, mud is an unfailing remedy, and pain in the joints is also relieved by it. From these and other experiments in mud-cure, I have come to the conclusion that earth is an invaluable element in the domestic treatment of diseases.
U||All kinds of earth are not, of course, equally beneficial. Dry earth dug out from a clean spot has been found the most effective. It should not be too sticky. Mud which is midway between sand and clay is the best. It should, of course, be free from cow-dung and other rubbish. It should be well sifted in a fine sieve, and then soaked in cold water to the consistency of well-kneaded dough before use. Then it should be tied up in a piece of clean, unstarched cloth, and used in the form of a thick poultice. The poultice should be removed before the mud begins to dry up; ordinarily it will last from two to three hours. Mud once used should never be used again, but a cloth once [Pg 98] used can be used again, after being well washed, provided it is free from blood and other dirty matter. If the poultice has to be applied to the abdomen, it should first be covered over with a warm cloth. Everybody should keep a tinful of earth ready for use, so as not to have to hunt for it whenever an occasion arises for its use. 
U||Otherwise, much precious time may be wasted in cases (as of scorpion-sting) where delay would be dangerous.
U||Chapter IV
U||FEVER AND ITS CURE
U||We now pass on to consider some particular diseases and the means of curing them. And first, fever.
U||We generally apply the term “fever” to a condition of heat in the body, but English doctors have distinguished many varieties of this disease, each with its own system of treatment. But, following the common practice and the principles elaborated in these chapters, we may say that all fevers can be cured in one and the same manner. I have tried this single treatment for all varieties from simple fever up to Bubonic Plague, with invariably satisfactory results. In 1904, there was a severe outbreak of plague among the Indians in [Pg 99] South Africa. It was so severe that, out of 23 persons that were affected, as many as 21 died within the space of 24 hours; and of the remaining two, who were removed to the hospital, only one survived, and that one was the man to whom was applied the mud-poultice. We cannot, of course, conclude from this that it was the mud-poultice that saved him, but, in any case, it is undeniable that it did him no harm. They were both suffering from high fever brought on by inflammatio
U||n of the lungs, and had been rendered unconscious. The man on whom was tried the mud-poultice was so bad that he was spitting blood, and I afterwards learnt from the doctor that he had been insufficiently fed on milk alone.
U||As most fevers are caused by disorders of the bowels, the very first thing to do is to starve the patient. It is a mere superstition that a weak man will get weaker by starving. As we have already seen, only that portion of our food is really useful which is assimilated into the blood, and the remainder only clogs the bowels. In fever the digestive organs are very weak, the tongue gets coated, and the lips are hard and dry. If any food is given to the patient in this condition, it will remain undigested and aid the fever. Starving the patient gives his digestive organs time to perform their work; hence the need to starve him for a day [Pg 100] or two. At the same time, he should take at least two baths every day according to the Kuhne’s system. If he is too weak or ill to bathe, a mud-poultice should be applied to his abdomen. If the head aches or feels too hot, a poultice should also be applied to the head. The patient should, as far as possible, be placed in the open air, and should be well covered. At m
U||eal-time, he should be given the juice of lime, well filtered and mixed with cold or boiling water, and if possible, without any sugar. This has a very beneficial effect, and should alone be given if the patient’s teeth can bear its sourness. Afterwards, he may be given a half or the whole of a plantain, well mixed with a spoon of olive oil, mixed with a spoon of lime juice. If he feels thirsty, he should be given water boiled and cooled, or the juice of lime,—never unboiled water. His clothes should be as few as possible, and should be frequently changed. Even persons suffering from typhoid and the like diseases have been completely cured by this simple treatment, and are enjoying perfect health at present. A seeming cure may also be effected by quinine, but it really brings other diseases in its train. Even in malarial fever, in which quinine is supposed to be most effective, I have rarely seen it bring permanent relief; on the other hand, I have actually seen several cases of malarial patients [Pg 101
U||] being permanently cured by the treatment described above.
U||Many people subsist on milk alone during fever, but my experience is that it really does harm in the initial stages, as it is hard to digest. If milk has to be given, it is best given in the form of “wheat-coffee”, 1 or with a small quantity of rice-flour well boiled in water; but in extreme forms of fever, it ought not to be given at all. In such a condition, the juice of lime may always be given with great success. As soon as the tongue gets clean, plantain may be included in the diet, and given in the form described above. If there be constipation, a hot-water enema with borax should be applied in preference to purgatives, after which a diet of olive oil will serve to keep the bowels free.
U||1 Part I, chap. V
U||Chapter V
U||CONSTIPATION, DYSENTERY, GRIPES AND PILES
U||It may at first sight appear strange to have four different ailments put together in this chapter, but, as a matter of fact, they are all so closely connected, and may be cured more or less in the same way. When the stomach gets clogged by undigested matter, it leads to one or other of these [Pg 102] diseases, according to the varying constitutions of individuals. In some it produces constipation. The bowels do not move, or move only partly, and there is great straining at stools, until it results in bleeding, or at times in the discharge of mucus, or piles. In others, it leads to diarrhea, which often ends in dysentery. In others again, it may give rise to gripes, accompanied by pain in the stomach and the discharge of mucus.
U||In all these cases, the patient loses his appetite, his body gets pale and weak, his tongue gets coated, and his breath foul. Many also suffer from headache and other complaints. Constipation, indeed, is so common that hundreds of pills and powders have been invented to cure it. The chief function of such patent medicines as Mother Siegel’s Syrup and Eno’s Fruit-salt is to relieve constipation, and hence thousands of people go in for them in the vain hope of being cured for good. Any Vaid or Hakim will tell you that constipation and the like are the result of indigestion, and that the best way to cure them is to remove the causes of indigestion; but the more candid among them will confess that they are forced to manufacture pills and powders, since the patients are not really prepared to renounce their bad habits, but at the same time want to get cured. Indeed the present-day advertisments of such [Pg 103] medicines go to the extent of promising to those that would buy them that they need observe no dire
U||ctions as to diet and the like, but may eat and drink whatever they like. But my readers need not be told that this is a mere string of lies. All purgatives are invariably injurious to health. Even the mildest of them, even if they relieve the constipation, give rise to other forms of disease. If they should do any good at all, the patient should thoroughly change his ways of life, so as not to have to turn to purgatives again; otherwise, there can be no doubt that they must give rise to new diseases, even supposing that they serve to get rid of the old.
U||The very first thing to do in cases of constipation and the like is to reduce the quantity of food, especially such heavy things as ghee, sugar and cream of milk. Of course, he should eschew altogether wine, tobacco, bhang, tea, coffee, cocoa, and loaves made of “mill flour.” The diet should consist for the most part of fresh fruits with olive oil.
U||The patient should be made to starve for 36 hours before treatment begins. During this time and after, mud-poultices should be applied to the abdomen during sleep; and, as has been already said, one or two “Kuhne baths” should also be taken. The patient should be made to walk for at [Pg 104] least two hours every day. I have myself seen severe cases of constipation, dysentery, piles and gripes effectively cured by this simple treatment. Piles may not, of course, completely disappear, but they will certainly cease to give trouble. The sufferer from gripes should take special care not to take any food except lime-juice in hot water, so long as there is discharge of blood or mucus. If there is excessive griping pain in the stomach, it can be cured by warming with a bottle of hot water or a piece of well-heated brick. Needless to say, the patient should live constantly in the open air.
U||Fruits like the French plum, the raisin, the orange and the grape, are particularly useful in constipation. This does not, of course, mean that these fruits may be eaten even where there is no hunger. They ought not to be eaten at all in cases of gripes accompanied by a bad taste in the mouth.
U||Chapter VI
U||CONTAGIOUS DISEASES: SMALL-POX
U||Now we will proceed to deal with the treatment of contagious diseases. They have a common origin, but, since small-pox is by far the most important of them, we will give a separate chapter to it, dealing with the rest in another chapter. [Pg 105] We are all terribly afraid of the small-pox, and have very crude notions about it. We in India even worship it as a deity. In fact it is caused, just like other diseases, by the blood getting impure owing to some disorder of the bowels; and the poison that accumulates in the system is expelled in the form of small-pox. If this view is correct, then there is absolutely no need to be afraid of small-pox. If it were really a contagious disease, everyone should catch it by merely touching the patient; but this is not always the case. Hence there is really no harm in touching the patient, provided we take some essential precautions in doing so. We cannot, of course, assert that small-pox is never transmitted by touch, for those that are physically in a condition favourab
U||le to its transmission will catch it. This is why, in a locality where small-pox has appeared, many people are found attacked by it at the same time. This has given rise to the superstition that it is a contagious disease, and hence to the attempt to mislead the people into the belief that vaccination is an effective means of preventing it. The process of vaccination consists in injecting into the skin the liquid that is obtained by applying the discharge from the body of a small-pox patient to the udder of a cow. The original theory was that a single vaccination would suffice to keep a man [Pg 106] immune from this disease for life; but, when it was found that even vaccinated persons were attacked by the disease, a new theory came into being that the vaccination should be renewed after a certain period, and to-day it has become the rule for all persons—whether already vaccinated or not—to get themselves vaccinated whenever small-pox rages as an epidemic in any locality, so that it is no uncommon thing t
U||o come across people who have been vaccinated five or six times, or even more.
U||Vaccination is a barbarous practice, and it is one of the most fatal of all the delusions current in our time, not to be found even among the so-called savage races of the world. Its supporters are not content with its adoption by those who have no objection to it, but seek to impose it with the aid of penal laws and rigorous punishments on all people alike. The practice of vaccination is not very old, dating as it does only from 1798 A.D. But, during this comparatively short period that has elapsed, millions have fallen a prey to the delusion that those who get themselves vaccinated are safe from the attack of small-pox. No one can say that small-pox will necessarily attack those who have not been vaccinated; for many cases have been observed of unvaccinated people being free from its attack. From the fact that some people who are not vaccinated do get the [Pg 107] disease, we cannot, of course, conclude that they would have been immune if only they had got themselves vaccinated.
U||Moreover, vaccination is a very dirty process, for the serum which is introduced into the human body includes not only that of the cow, but also of the actual small-pox patient. An average man would even vomit at the mere sight of this stuff. If the hand happens to touch it, it is always washed with soap. The mere suggestion of tasting it fills us with indignation and disgust. But how few of those who get themselves vaccinated realise that they are in effect eating this filthy stuff! Most people know that, in several diseases, medicines and liquid food are injected into the blood, and that they are assimilated into the system more rapidly than if they were taken through the mouth. The only difference, in fact, between injection and the ordinary process of eating through the mouth is that the assimilation in the former case is instantaneous, while that in the latter is slow. And yet we do not shrink from getting ourselves vaccinated! As has been well said, cowards die a living death, and our craze for vaccina
U||tion is solely due to the fear of death or disfigurement by small-pox.
U||I cannot also help feeling that vaccination is a violation of the dictates of religion and morality. [Pg 108] The drinking of the blood of even dead animals is looked upon with horror even by habitual meat-eaters. Yet, what is vaccination but the taking in of the poisoned blood of an innocent living animal? Better far were it for God-fearing men that they should a thousand times become the victims of small-pox and even die a terrible death than that they should be guilty of such an act of sacrilege.
U||Several of the most thoughtful men in England have laboriously investigated the manifold evils of vaccination, and an Anti-Vaccination Society has also been formed there. The members of this society have declared open war against vaccination, and many have even gone to gaol for this cause. Their objections to vaccination are briefly as follows:
U||(1) The preparation of the vaccine from the udder of cows or calves entails untold suffering on thousands of innocent creatures, and this cannot possibly be justified by any gains resulting from vaccination.
U||(2) Vaccination, instead of doing good, works considerable mischief by giving rise to many new diseases. Even its advocates cannot deny that, after its introduction, many new diseases have come into being.
U||(3) The vaccine that is prepared from the blood of a small-pox patient is likely to contain and [Pg 109] transmit the germs of all the several diseases that he may be suffering from.
U||(4) There is no guarantee that small-pox will not attack the vaccinated. Dr. Jenner, the inventor of vaccination, originally supposed that perfect immunity could be secured by a single injection on a single arm; but when it was found to fail, it was asserted that vaccination on both the arms would serve the purpose; and when even this proved ineffectual, it came to be held that both the arms should be vaccinated at more than one place, and that it should also be renewed once in seven years. Finally, the period of immunity has further been reduced to three years! All this clearly shows that doctors themselves have no definite views on the matter. The truth is, as we have already said, that there is no saying that small-pox will not attack the vaccinated, or that all cases of immunity must needs be due to vaccination.
U||(5) The vaccine is a filthy substance, and it is foolish to expect that one kind of filth can be removed by another.
U||By these and similar arguments, this society has already produced a large volume of public opinion against vaccination. In a certain town, for instance, a large proportion of the people refuse to be vaccinated, and yet statistics prove that they are singularly free from disease. The fact of the [Pg 110] matter is that it is only the self-interest of doctors that stands in the way of the abolition of this inhuman practice, for the fear of losing the large incomes that they at present derive from this source blinds them to the countless evils which it brings. There are, however, a few doctors who recognise these evils, and who are determined opponents of vaccination.
U||Those who are conscientious objectors to vaccination should, of course, have the courage to face all penalties or persecutions to which they may be subjected by law, and stand alone, if need be, against the whole world, in defence of their conviction. Those who object to it merely on the grounds of health should acquire a complete mastery of the subject, and should be able to convince others of the correctness of their views, and convert them into adopting those views in practice. But those who have neither definite views on the subject nor courage enough to stand up for their convictions should no doubt obey the laws of the state, and shape their conduct in deference to the opinions and practices of the world around them.
U||Those who object to vaccination should observe all the more strictly the laws of health already explained; for the strict observance of these laws ensures in the system those vital forces which counteract all disease germs, and is, therefore, the [Pg 111] best protection against small-pox as well as other diseases. If, while objecting to the introduction of the poisonous vaccine into the system, they surrendered themselves to the still more fatal poison of sensuality, they would undoubtedly forfeit their right to ask the world to accept their views on the matter.
U||When small-pox has actually appeared, the best treatment is the “Wet-Sheet-Pack”, which should be applied three times a day. It relieves the fever, and the sores heal rapidly. There is no need at all to apply oils or ointments on the sores. If possible, a mud-poultice should be applied in one or two places. The diet should consist of rice, and light fresh fruits, all rich fruits like date and almond being avoided. Normally the sores should begin to heal under the “Wet-Sheet-Pack” in less than a week; if they do not, it means that the poison in the system has not been completely expelled. Instead of looking upon small-pox as a terrible disease, we should regard it as one of Nature’s best expedients for getting rid of the accumulated poison in the body, and the restoration of normal health.
U||After an attack of small-pox, the patient remains weak for sometime, and in some cases even suffers from other ailments. But this is due not to the small-pox itself; but to the wrong remedies employed [Pg 112] to cure it. Thus, the use of quinine in fever often results in deafness, and even leads to the extreme form of it known as “quininism”. So too, the employment of mercury in venereal diseases leads to many new forms of disease. Then again, too frequent use of purgatives in constipation brings on ailments like the piles. The only sound system of treatment is that which attempts to remove the root-causes of disease by a strict observance of the fundamental laws of health. Even the costly Bhasmas which are supposed to be unfailing remedies for such diseases are in effect highly injurious; for, although they may seem to do some good, they excite the evil passions, and ultimately ruin the health.
U||After the vesicles on the body have given place to scabs, olive oil should be constantly applied, and the patient bathed every day. Then the scabs rapidly fall off, and even the pocks soon disappear, the skin recovering its normal colour and freshness.
U||Chapter VII
U||OTHER CONTAGIOUS DISEASES
U||We do not dread chicken-pox so much as its elder sister, since it is not so fatal, and does not cause disfigurement and the like. It is, however, exactly [Pg 113] the same as small-pox in other respects, and should therefore be dealt with in the same way.
U||Bubonic Plague is a terrible disease, and has accounted for the death of millions of our people since the year 1896, when it first made its real entry into our land. The doctors, in spite of all their investigations, have not yet been able to invent a sure remedy for it. Now-a-days the practice of inoculation has come into vogue, and the belief has gained ground that an attack of plague may be obviated by it. But inoculation for plague is as bad and as sinful as vaccination for small-pox. Although no sure remedy has been devised for this disease, we will venture to suggest the following treatment to those who have full faith in Providence, and who are not afraid of death.
U||(1) The “Wet-Sheet-Pack” should be applied as soon as the first symptoms of fever appear.
U||(2) A thick mud-poultice should be applied to the bubo.
U||(3) The patient should be completely starved.
U||(4) If he feels thirsty, he should be given lime-juice in cold water.
U||(5) He should be made to lie in the open air.
U||(6) There should not be more than one attendant by the side of the patient.
U||We can confidently assert that, if plague can be [Pg 114] cured by any treatment at all, it can be cured by this.
U||Though the exact origin and causes of plague are yet unknown, it is undoubted that rats have something to do with its communication. We should, therefore, take all precautions, in a plague-infected area, to prevent the approach of rats in our dwellings; if we cannot get rid of them, we should vacate the house.
U||The best remedy to prevent an attack of plague is, of course, to follow strictly the laws of health,—to live in the open air, to eat plain wholesome food and in moderation, to take good exercise, to keep the house neat and clean, to avoid all evil habits, and, in short, lead a life of utter simplicity and purity. Even in normal times our lives should be such, but, in times of plague and other epidemics, we should be doubly careful.
U||Pneumonic Plague is an even more dangerous form of this disease. Its attack is sudden and almost invariably fatal. The patient has very high fever, feels extreme difficulty in breathing, and in most cases, is rendered unconscious. This form of plague broke out in Johannesburg in 1904, and as has been already said, 2 only one man escaped alive out of the 23 who were attacked. The treatment for this disease is just the same as that for [Pg 115] Bubonic Plague, with this difference that the poultice should be applied in this case to both sides of the chest. If there be no time to try the "Wet-Sheet-Pack", a thin poultice of mud should be applied to the head. Needless to say, here as in other cases, prevention is better than cure.
U||2 Part II, chap. IV
U||We are terribly afraid of cholera, as of plague, but in fact, it is much less fatal. Here the “Wet-Sheet-Pack”, however, is of no effect, but the mud-poultice should be applied to the stomach, and where there is a tingling sensation, the affected part should be warmed with a bottle filled with warm water. The feet should be rubbed with mustard-oil, and the patient should be starved. Care should be taken to see that he does not get alarmed. If the motions are too frequent, the patient should not be repeatedly taken out of bed, but a flat shallow vessel should be placed underneath to receive the stools. If these precautions are taken in due time, there is little fear of danger. This disease generally breaks out in the hot season, when we generally eat all sorts of unripe and over-ripe fruits in immoderate quantities and in addition to our ordinary food. The water also that we drink during this season is often dirty, as the quantity of it in wells and tanks is small, and we take no trouble to boil or filter
U|| it. Then again, the stools of the patients being allowed [Pg 116] to lie exposed, the germs of the disease are communicated through the air. Indeed, when we consider how little heed we pay to these most elementary facts and principles, we can only wonder that we are not more often attacked by these terrible diseases.
U||During the prevalence of cholera, we should eat light food in moderation. We should breathe plenty of fresh air; and the water that we drink should always be thoroughly boiled, and filtered with a thick clean piece of cloth. The stools of the patient should be covered up with a thick layer of earth. Indeed, even in normal times, we should invariably cover up the stools with ashes or loose earth. If we do so, there would be much less danger of the spread of disease. Even the lower animals like the cat take this precaution, but we are worse than they in this respect.
U||It should also be thoroughly impressed on the minds of persons suffering from contagious diseases, as well as those around them, that they should, under no circumstances, give way to panic, for fear always paralyses the nerves and increases the danger of fatality.
U||[Pg 117]
U||Chapter VIII
U||MATERNITY AND CHILD-BIRTH
U||Our object in the foregoing chapters has been to point out the unity of origin and treatment of some of the more common diseases. We are, indeed, fully aware that those who are the constant victims of disease, and who are constantly oppressed by the fear of death, will still continue to put themselves at the mercy of doctors, in spite of all that we might say against it. We venture to think, however, that there would be at least a few who are willing to cure themselves of their diseases by purely natural processes, so as to save themselves from all further attacks; and such persons would surely find it worth while to follow the simple directions we have given. Before concluding this book, we will also give a few hints on maternity and the care of the child, as well as some common accidents.
U||In the lower orders of the animal creation, the pangs of child-birth are altogether unknown. The same should really be the case with perfectly healthy women. In fact, most women in the country regard child-birth as quite an ordinary matter; they continue to do their normal work till almost the last moment, and experience hardly any pain at the time of delivery. Women employed in labour have also been known to be able [Pg 118] very often to return to work almost immediately after child-birth.
U||How comes it, then, that women in towns and cities have to endure so much pain and suffering at the time of child-birth? And why is it that they have to receive special treatment before and after the delivery?
U||The answer is simple and obvious. The women in towns have to lead an unnatural life. Their food, their costume, their mode of life, in general, offend against the natural laws of healthy living. Further, besides becoming pregnant at a premature age, they are the sad victims of men’s lust even after pregnancy, as well as immediately after child-birth, so that conception again takes place at too short an interval. This is the state of utter misery and wretchedness in which lakhs of our young girls and women find themselves in our country to-day. To my mind, life under such conditions is little removed from the tortures of hell. So long as men continue to behave so monstrously, there can be no hope of happiness for our women. Many men put the blame on the women’s shoulders; but it is none of our business here to weigh the relative guilt of man and woman in this matter. We are only concerned to recognise the existence of the evil, and to point out its cure. Let all married people realise, once for all, that,
U|| so long as sexual [Pg 119] enjoyment at a premature age, as well as during pregnancy and soon after child-birth, does not cease to exist in our land, an easy and painless child-birth must remain a wild dream. Women silently endure the pangs of child-birth, as well as the subsequent period of confinement, under the wrong notion that they are inevitable, but they fail to see how their own ignorance and weakness of will make their children grow weaker and droop from day to day. It is the clear duty of every man and woman to try to avert this calamity at any cost. If even a single man and woman should do their duty in this matter, to that extent it would mean the elevation of the world. And this is clearly a matter in which no man need or should wait for another’s example.
U||It follows, then, that the very first duty of the husband is wholly to abstain from all sexual intercourse with the wife from the moment of conception. And great is the responsibility that rests on the wife during the nine months that follow. She should be made to realise that the character of the child to be born will depend entirely on her life and conduct during this sacred period. If she fills her mind with love for all things that are good and noble, the child will also manifest the same disposition; if, on the other hand, she gives way to anger and other [Pg 120] evil passions, her child will necessarily inherit the same. Hence in these nine months, she should engage herself constantly in good works, free her mind from all fear and worry, give no room for any evil thoughts or feelings, keep out all untruth from her life, and waste not a moment in idle talk or deed. The child that is born of such a mother,—how can it help being noble and strong?
U||The pregnant woman should, of course, keep her body as pure as her mind. She should breathe plenty of fresh air, and eat only so much of plain and wholesome food as she can easily digest. If she attends to all the directions already given in the matter of diet etc., she would have no need at all to seek the aid of doctors. If she suffers from constipation, the proportion of olive oil in the diet should be increased; and in cases of nausea or vomitting, she should take juice of lime in water without sugar. All spices and condiments should be scrupulously avoided.
U||The yearning for various new things that attends a woman in pregnancy may be restrained by the use of “Kuhne Baths”. This is also useful in increasing her strength and vitality, and in easing the pangs of child-birth. It is also necessary to steel her mind against such yearnings by nipping in the bud each desire as it comes. The parents [Pg 121] should be constantly mindful of the welfare of the child in the womb.
U||It is also the husband’s duty during this period to refrain from all wranglings with his wife, and to conduct himself in such a way as to make her cheerful and happy. She should be relieved of the heavier duties of household management, and made to walk for some time every day in fresh air. And on no account should she be given any drugs or medicines during the period.
U||Chapter IX
U||CARE OF THE CHILD
U||We do not propose in this chapter to describe the duties of a midwife or wet nurse, but only to point out how the child should be cared for after birth. Those who have read the foregoing chapters need not be told how injurious it is to keep the mother during the period of confinement in a dark and ill-ventilated closet and to make her lie on a dirty bed with a fire underneath. These practices, however time-honoured they may be, are nevertheless fraught with dangerous consequences. No doubt, during the cold season, the mother should be kept warm, but this is best done by using good blankets. If the apartment is too cold and a fire has to be kept, it must be lighted outside and only [Pg 122] brought in when all the smoke has disappeared, and even then it should not be kept under the cot on which she lies. Warmth may also be given by keeping bottles of hot water on the bed. All the clothes and sheets should be thoroughly cleansed after child-birth, and before being used again.
U||As the health of the child will depend entirely on that of the mother, special attention must be paid to her diet and mode of living. If she is fed on wheat, with plenty of good fruits like the plantain, and olive oil she would feel warm and strong, and have plenty of milk. Olive oil gives aperient properties to the mother’s milk, and thus serves to keep the child free from constipation. If the child is unwell, attention must be turned to the state of the mother’s health. Administering drugs to the child is as good as murdering it, for the child with its delicate constitution, easily succumbs to their poisonous effects. Hence the medicine should be administered to the mother, so that its beneficial properties may be transmitted to the child through her milk. If the child suffers, as it often does, from cough or loose bowels, there is no cause for alarm; we should wait for a day or so, and try to get at the root of the trouble, and then remove it. Making fuss over it and falling into a panic only makes ma
U||tters worse.
U||The child should invariably be bathed in tepid [Pg 123] water. Its clothing should be as little as possible; for a few months it is best to have none at all. The child should be laid on a thin soft white sheet and covered with a warm cloth. This will obviate the need for the use of shirts, prevent the clothes from getting dirty, and make the child hardy and strong. A fine piece of cloth folded into four should be placed over the navel-string, and kept in position by a band over it. The practice of tying a thread to the navel-string and hanging it round the neck is highly injurious. The navel-band should be kept loose. If the part round the navel be moist, fine well-sifted flour may be gently applied over it.
U||As long as the supply of the mother’s milk is sufficient, the child should be fed exclusively on it; but, when it gets insufficient, fried wheat well powdered, and mixed with hot water and a little of jaggery, may be used as a substitute with quite good results. Half a plantain well mashed and mixed with half a spoonful of olive oil is also particularly beneficial. If cow’s milk has to be given, it should at first be mixed with water in the proportion of three to one, and then heated until it just begins to boil, when a little of pure jaggery should also be added. The use of sugar instead of jaggery is harmful. The child should gradually be accustomed to a fruit-diet, [Pg 124] so that its blood may be kept pure from the very beginning, and it may grow manly and bright. Those mothers who begin to feed their children on things like rice, vegetables and dhall, as soon as or even before its teeth have appeared, are doing them infinite harm. Needless to say, coffee and tea should be strictly eschewed.
U||When the child has grown big enough to walk, it may be clothed with kurta and the like, but its feet should still be kept bare, so that it may be free to roam about at will. The use of shoes prevents the free circulation of blood and the development of hardy feet and legs. Dressing the child in silk or lace cloths, with cap and coat, and ornaments, is a barbarous practice. Our attempt to enhance by such ridiculous means the beauty that Nature has given, only bespeaks our vanity and ignorance. We should always remember that the education of the child really begins from its very birth, and is best given by the parents themselves. The use of threats and punishments, and the practice of gorging the children with food, are an outrage on the principles of true education. As the old saying has it, “like parent, like child”; hence the example and practice of the parents necessarily shape the conduct and character of the children. If they are weaklings, their children also grow up weak and [Pg 125] delicate; if t
U||hey talk clearly and distinctly, so too will the children; but if they talk with a lisp, the children will also learn to do so. If they use foul language, or are addicted to bad habits, the children necessarily imitate them, and develop into bad characters. In fact, there is no field of human activity in which the child does not imitate the example of its parents.
U||We see, then, how heavy is the responsibility that rests on the shoulders of parents. The very first duty of a man is to give such education to his children as will make them honest and truthful, and an ornament to the society in which they live. In the animal and vegetable kingdoms, the offspring invariably takes after the parent. Man alone has violated this law of Nature. It is only among men that we see such incongruities as vicious children being born to virtuous parents, or sickly ones to the healthy. This is due to the fact that we thoughtlessly become parents when we are not mature enough to assume the responsibilities of that position. It is the solemn duty of all virtuous parents to train their children in noble ways. This requires that both the father and the mother should themselves have received a sound education. Where the parents lack such education and are aware of their imperfections, it is their duty to entrust their children to the care of proper [Pg 126] guardians. It is foolish to expect 
U||that a high character can be developed in the children by merely sending them to school. Where the training given at school is inconsistent with that given at home, there can be no hope of improvement for the child.
U||As already pointed out, the true education of the child begins from the very moment of its birth. The rudiments of knowledge are imbibed almost in the course of play. This, indeed, was the ancient tradition; the practice of sending children to school is a growth of yesterday. If only the parents would do their duty by their children, there would be no limit to the possibilities of their advancement. But, in fact, we make playthings of our children. We deck their persons with fine clothes and jewels, we gorge them with sweetmeats, and spoil them from their very infancy by fondlings and caresses. We let them go unchecked on their way in our false affection for them. Being ourselves miserly, sensuous, dishonest, slothful and uncleanly, is it to be wondered at that our children should follow in our foot steps, and turn out weak and vicious, selfish and slothful, sensuous and immoral? Let all thoughtful parents ponder well over these matters; for on them depends the future of our land.
U||[Pg 127]
U||Chapter X
U||SOME ACCIDENTS: DROWNING
U||We will now turn our attention to some of the more common accidents, and the methods of dealing with them. A knowledge of these things is essential to everybody, so that timely help may be rendered, and the loss of many precious lives averted. Even children should be taught to deal with these cases, as in that way they are the more likely to grow up kind and thoughtful citizens.
U||And first we will deal with drowning. As man cannot live without air for more than 5 minutes at the most, little life generally remains in a drowning man taken out of water. Immediate steps should, therefore, be taken to bring him back to life. Two things have specially to be done for these,—artificial respiration, and the application of warmth. We should not forget that very often such ‘First aid’ has to be rendered by the side of tanks and rivers, where all the needed materials are not easily available, and such aid can be most effectual only when there are at least two or three men on the spot. The first-aider should also possess the qualities of resourcefulness, patience, and briskness; if he himself loses his presence of mind, he can do nothing. So too, if the attendants begin to discuss methods, or quarrel over details, there is no hope for the man. The best one in the party should [Pg 128] lead, and the others should implicitly follow his directions.
U||As soon as the man is taken out of water, his wet clothes should be removed, and his body wiped dry. Then he should be made to lie on his face, with his hands under the head. Then, with our hand on his chest, we should remove from his mouth the water and dirt that might have got in. At this time his tongue would come out of his mouth, when it should be caught hold of with a kerchief, and held till consciousness returns. Then he should at once be turned over, with the head and the chest a little raised above the feet. Then one of the attendants should kneel by his head, and slowly spread out and straighten his arms on either side. By this means his ribs will be raised, and the air outside can enter into his body; then his hands should be quickly brought back and folded on his chest, so that the chest may contract and the air be expelled. In addition to this, hot and cold water should be taken in the hands and poured on his chest. If a fire can be lighted or procured, the man should be warmed with it. Then all
U|| the available clothes should be wrapped round his body, which should be thoroughly rubbed for warmth. All this should be tried for a long time without losing hope. In some cases, such methods have to be applied for several hours on end [Pg 129] before breathing is restored. As soon as signs of consciousness appear, some hot drink should be administered. The juice of lime in hot water, or decoction of cloves, pepper, and the bark of the bay-tree, will be found specially effective. The smell of tobacco may also prove useful. People should not be allowed to crowd round the patient, and obstruct the free passage of air.
U||The signs of death in such cases are the following. The complete cessation of breathing and the beating of heart and lungs, as indicated by a piece of peacock-feather held near the nose remaining quite steady, or a mirror held near the mouth being undimmed by the moisture in the breath; the eyes remaining fixed and half-open, with heavy eye-lids; the jaws getting fixed; the fingers getting crooked; the tongue protruding between the teeth; the mouth getting frothy; nose getting red; the whole body turning pale. If all these signs simultaneously appear, we may conclude that the man is dead. In some rare cases, life may still remain even when all these signs are present. The only conclusive test of death is the setting in of decomposition. Hence the patient should never be given up for lost, until after a long and patient application of remedial measures.
U||[Pg 130]
U||Chapter XI
U||SOME ACCIDENTS—(Contd.)
U||Burns and Scalds
U||Very often when a man’s clothes catch fire, we get into a panic, and, instead of helping the injured, make matters worse by our ignorance. It is our duty, therefore, to know exactly what to do in such cases.
U||The person whose clothes have caught fire should not lose his presence of mind. If the fire is only at one edge of the cloth, it should at once be squeezed out with the hands; but if it has spread over the whole cloth or a large portion of it, the man should at once lie down and roll on the floor. If a thick cloth like a carpet be available, it should at once be wrapped round his body; and if water is at hand, it should also be poured over it. As soon as the fire has been put out, we should find out if there are burns in any part of the body. The cloth would generally stick to the body where there are burns, in which case it should not be forcibly torn off, but gently snipped off with a pair of scissors, leaving the affected parts undisturbed, and taking care to see that the skin does not come off. Immediately after this, poultices of pure mud should be applied to all these places, and kept in position by bandages. This will instantly relieve the burning, and ease the patient’s suffering. The [Pg 131] poul
U||tices may as well be applied over the portions of the cloth which stick on to the body. They should be renewed as soon as they begin to get dry; there is no reason to fear the touch of cold water.
U||Where this sort of first aid has not been rendered, the following directions will be found very useful. Fresh plantain leaves well smeared with olive or sweet oil should be applied over the burns. If plantain leaves are not available, pieces of cloth may be used. A mixture of linseed oil and lime-water in equal proportions may also be applied with great advantage. The portions of cloth which adhere to the burns may be easily removed by moistening them with a mixture of tepid milk and water. The first bandage of oil should be removed after two days, and afterwards fresh bandages applied every day. If blisters have formed on the burnt surface, they should be pricked, but the skin need not necessarily be removed.
U||If the skin has simply got red by the burn, there is no more effective remedy than the application of a mud poultice. If the fingers have been burnt, care should be taken, when the poultice is applied, that they do not touch against one another. This same treatment may be applied in cases of acid-burns, and scalds of every description.

U||SOME ACCIDENTS—(Contd.)
U||Snake-bite
U||There is no limit to the superstitions current among us in regard to snakes. From time immemorial we have cultivated a terrible fear of the snake; we even dread the very mention of its name. The Hindus worship the serpent, and have set apart a day in the year (Nagapanchami) for that purpose. They suppose that the earth is supported by the great serpent Sesha. God Vishnu is called Seshasayee, as he is supposed to sleep on the Serpent-God; and God Siva is supposed to have a garland of serpents round his neck! We say that such and such a thing cannot be described even by the thousand-tongued Adisesha, implying our belief in the snake’s knowledge and discretion. The serpent Karkotaka is said to have bitten King Nala and deformed him, so that he might not suffer any harm in the course of his wanderings. Such conceptions are also to be met with among the Christian nations of the West. In English a man is very often described to be as wise and cunning as a serpent. And in the Bible, Satan is said to have assumed 
U||the shape of a serpent in order to tempt Eve.
U||The real reason for the popular dread of snakes is obvious. If the snake’s poison should spread [Pg 133] over the whole body, death must necessarily ensue; and since the idea of death is so dreadful to us, we dread the very name of a snake. Hence, our worship of the snake is really based on our fear. If the snake were a little creature, it would hardly be worshipped by us; but since it is a big creature, and a strangely fascinating one, it has come to be deified and worshipped.
U||The Western scientists of to-day hold that the snake is merely a creature of instinct, and it should be destroyed forthwith wherever found. From the official statistics, we gather that not less than 20,000 persons die every year in India of snake-bite alone. The destruction of every venomous snake is rewarded by the state, but it is really a question if the country has benefitted by it in any way. We find from experience that a snake never bites wantonly, but only as a retaliatory measure when it is molested in any way. Does this not bespeak its discretion, or at the least its innocence? The attempt to rid Hindustan, or any portion thereof, of snakes is as ridiculous and futile as trying to wrestle with the air. It may be possible to prevent snakes coming to a particular place by a systematic process of extermination, but this can never be done on a large scale. In a vast country like India, it would be an altogether foolish enterprise to try to avoid snake-bites by wholesale destruction of the snakes.
U||[Pg 134]
U||Let us never forget that the serpents have been created by the same God who created us and all other creatures. God’s ways are inscrutable, but we may rest assured that He did not create animals like the lion and the tiger, the serpent and the scorpion, in order to bring about the destruction of the human race. If the serpents were to meet in council and conclude that man has been created by God for their destruction, seeing that he generally destroys a snake wherever found, should we approve of their conclusion? Surely not. In the same way, we are wrong in regarding the serpent as a natural enemy of man.
U||The great St. Francis of Asissi, who used to roam about the forests, was not hurt by the serpents or the wild beasts, but they even lived on terms of intimacy with him. So too, thousands of Yogis and Fakirs live in the forests of Hindustan, amidst lions and tigers and serpents, but we never hear of their meeting death at the hands of these animals. It might, however, be contended that they must certainly be meeting their death in the forests, but that we do not hear of it, as we live so far away. Granted; but we cannot deny that the number of Yogis that live in the forests is nothing in comparison with that of the serpents and wild beasts, so that, if these animals were really the natural enemies of man, the whole race of Yogis and other [Pg 135] dwellers in the forests should become very rapidly extinct, especially since they have no weapons with which to defend themselves against their attacks. But they have by no means become extinct, and we may conclude, therefore, that they have been allowed to live unm
U||olested in the forests by the serpents and wild beasts. In fact, I have implicit faith in the doctrine that, so long as man is not inimical to the other creatures, they will not be inimical to him. Love is the greatest of the attributes of man. Without it the worship of God would be an empty nothing. It is, in short, the root of all religion whatsoever.
U||Besides, why should we not regard the cruelty of the serpents and the wild beasts as merely the product and reflection of man’s own nature? Are we any the less murderous than they? Are not our tongues as venomous as the serpent’s fangs? Do we not prey upon our innocent brethren much in the same way as lions and leopards? All scriptures proclaim that, when man becomes absolutely harmless, all the other animals will begin to live on terms of intimacy with him. When feuds and conflicts as fierce as that between the lion and the lamb are going on within our own breasts, is it any wonder that such things should go on in the external world? For, we are but the reflection of the world around us; all the features of the [Pg 136] external world are found reflected in the inner world of our mind. When we change our nature, the world around should also inevitably change. Do we not find that the world assumes a totally different aspect to those individual men and women who change their own nature by strenuous self-d
U||iscipline? This is the great mystery of God’s creation as well as the great secret of true happiness. Our happiness or otherwise rests entirely upon what we are; we have no need to depend on other people at all in this matter.
U||Our excuse for writing at such length on snake-bite is this. Rather than merely prescribe cure for snake-bite, we thought it as well to go a little more deeply into the matter, and point out the best way of getting rid of our foolish fears. If even a single reader were to adopt in practice the principles we have been discussing, we shall consider our effort amply rewarded. Moreover, our object in writing these pages is not merely to give the generally accepted hygienic principles, but to go to the root of the matter, and deal with the most fundamental principles of health.
U||Modern investigations have also shown that the man who is perfectly healthy, whose blood has not been tainted by excess of heat, and whose food is wholesome and Satvic, is not immediately affected by the poison of the snake, but that, on the other [Pg 137] hand, its effect is instantaneous as well as fatal on the man whose blood has been tainted by drink or unwholesome food. One doctor goes so far as to say that the blood of the man who eschews salt and the like, and lives exclusively on a fruit-diet, remains so pure that no kind of poison can have any effect on him. I have not had enough experience myself to say how far this is true. The man whose diet has been free from salt and the like for only one or two years cannot be said to have attained this stage of perfect immunity, for the blood which has been tainted and poisoned by bad practices continued for years cannot be brought back to its normal state of purity in the short period of a year or two.
U||It has further been scientifically demonstrated that a man under the influence of fear or anger is much more and much sooner, affected by poison than when in the normal condition. Everybody knows how fear and anger make the pulse and the heart beat faster than the normal rate, and the quicker the flow of blood in the veins, the greater the heat generated. But the heat generated by evil passions is not healthy, but extremely harmful. Anger is, indeed, nothing but a variety of fever. Hence the best antidote against snake-bite is to use pure and Satvic food in moderation, to rid our minds of all evil passions like anger and fear, [Pg 138] to refrain from giving way to panic, to retain perfect confidence in the saving power of a pure and godly life, and to remain self-possessed in the full faith that we are ever in God’s hands, and that the span of life which He has allotted to us can on no account be curtailed or exceeded.
U||Dr. Fitz-Seaman, the Director of the Port Elizabeth Museum, who has devoted a large portion of his life to the study of snakes, their varieties and their habits, and who is a great authority on snake-bite and its cure, has told us, as a result of his numerous experiments, that the majority of the so-called deaths by snake-bite are really caused by fear and the wrong remedies applied by quacks.
U||We should remember that all snakes are not venomous, and that even the bite of all venomous snakes is not immediately fatal either. Moreover, the snakes do not always get an opportunity of injecting their venom into the body of their victim. We should not, therefore, give way to panic even when we are bitten by a venomous serpent, especially since very simple remedies are available, which can be applied by ourselves without any aid from others.
U||The part of the body immediately above the point at which the snake has bitten should be tied round with tight bandage, which should be further strengthened by means of strong pencils or pieces [Pg 139] of wood, so that the poison may not ascend through the veins. Then the wound should be cut half an inch deep with the fine point of a knife, so that the poisoned blood may freely flow, and the hollow should be filled with the dark-red powder sold in the bazaars and known as Potassium Permanganate. If this is not available, the blood issuing from the wound should be well sucked and spat out, by the patient himself or by somebody else, until all the poison has been removed. Of course, no man who has a wound on the lips or the tongue should be allowed to suck this poisoned blood. This treatment should be applied within 7 minutes of the accident,—that is to say, before the poison has had time to ascend and diffuse through the body. As already mentioned, the German doctor who has specialised in mud-cure, claims 
U||to have cured snake-bite by burying the patient under fresh earth. Although I have not tried the use of mud in snake-bites, I have unbounded faith in its efficacy from my experience in other cases. After the application of Potassium Permanganate (or the sucking out of the blood, in the alternative,) a poultice of mud half an inch in thickness, and big enough to cover the whole region around and above the affected part, should be applied. There should be kept in every home a quantity of well-sifted and powdered mud [Pg 140] in a tin ready for use. It should be so kept as to be exposed to light and air, and free from dampness. Suitable bandages of cloth should also be kept so as to be within reach when needed. These will be found useful not only in snake-bite, but in numberless other cases as well.
U||If the patient has lost consciousness, or if respiration seems to have ceased, the process of artificial respiration already described in connection with drowning should be resorted to. Hot water, or preferably a decoction of cloves and the bark of the bay-tree, is very useful for recovering consciousness. The patient should be kept in the open air, but if his body seems to have taken cold, bottles of hot water should be employed, or a piece of flannel dipped in hot water and wrung out should be rubbed over the body, to produce warmth.
U||Chapter XIII
U||SOME ACCIDENTS—(Contd.)
U||Scorpion-Sting
U||Our familiar expression, “May God never give any man the pain of scorpion-sting”, shows how keen that pain is. In fact, this pain is even sharper than that of snake-bite, but we do not dread it so much, since it is much less fatal. [Pg 141] Indeed, as Dr. Moor has said, the man whose blood is perfectly pure has little to fear from the sting of a scorpion.
U||The treatment for scorpion-sting is very simple. The affected part should be cut into with a sharp-pointed knife, and the blood that issues from it slightly sucked out. A small bandage tied tightly above this portion would prevent the spread of the poison, while a poultice of mud would give immediate relief to the pain.
U||Some writers advise us to tie a thick bandage of cloth over the affected part, wetted with a mixture of vinegar and water in equal proportions, or to keep the region around it immersed in salt water. But the poultice of mud is certainly the most effective remedy of all, as may be personally tested by those who may have the misfortune to be stung by scorpions. The poultice should be as thick as possible; even two seers of mud would not be too much for the purpose. If the finger be stung, for instance, the poultice should extend up to the elbow. If the hand be kept immersed for sometime in wet mud in a pretty large vessel, it would give instant relief to the pain.
U||The stings of the centipede and other animals should be dealt with exactly as that of the scorpion.
U||[Pg 142]
U||Chapter XIV
U||CONCLUSION
U||I have now said all that I had intended to say on the subject of health. And now, before finally taking leave of my readers, I will say a word or two on my object in writing these pages.
U||One question which I have asked myself again and again, in the course of writing this book, is why I of all persons should write it. Is there any justification at all for one like me, who am no doctor, and whose knowledge of the matters dealt with in these pages must be necessarily imperfect, attempting to write a book of this kind?
U||My defence is this. The “science” of medicine is itself based upon imperfect knowledge, most of it being mere quackery. But this book, at any rate, has been prompted by the purest of motives. The attempt is here made not so much to show how to cure diseases as to point out the means of preventing them. And a little reflection will show that the prevention of disease is a comparatively simple matter, not requiring much specialist knowledge, although it is by no means an easy thing to put these principles into practice. Our object has been to show the unity of origin and treatment of all diseases, so that all people may [Pg 143] learn to treat their diseases themselves when they do arise, as they often do, in spite of great care in the observance of the laws of health.
U||But, after all, why is good health so essential, so anxiously to be sought for? Our ordinary conduct would seem to indicate that we attach little value to health. If health is to be sought for in order that we might indulge in luxury and pleasure, or pride ourselves over our body and regard it as an end in itself, then indeed it would be far better that we should have bodies tainted with bad blood, by fat, and the like.
U||All religions agree in regarding the human body as an abode of God. Our body has been given to us on the understanding that we should render devoted service to God with its aid. It is our duty to keep it pure and unstained from within as well as from without, so as to render it back to the Giver, when the time comes for it, in the state of purity in which we got it. If we fulfil the terms of the contract to God’s satisfaction, He will surely reward us, and make us heirs to immortality.
U||The bodies of all created beings have been gifted with the same senses, and the same capacity for seeing, hearing, smelling and the like; but the human body is supreme among them all, and hence we call it a “Chintamani,” or [Pg 144] a giver of all good. Man alone can worship God with knowledge and understanding. Where devotion to God is void of understanding, there can be no true salvation, and without salvation there can be no true happiness. The body can be of real service only when we realise it to be a temple of God and make use of it for God’s worship; otherwise it is no better than a filthy vessel of bones, flesh and blood, and the air and water issuing from it are worse than poison. The things that come out of the body through the pores and other passages are so filthy that we cannot touch them or even think of them without disgust; and it requires very great effort to keep them tolerably clean. Is it not most disgraceful that, for the sake of this body, we should stoop to falsehood and deceit, 
U||licentious practices and even worse? Is it not equally shameful that, for the sake of these vices, we should be so anxious to preserve this fragile frame of ours at any cost?
U||This is the truth of the matter in regard to our body; for the very things which are the best or the most useful have inherent in them capabilities of a corresponding mischief. Otherwise, we should hardly be able to appreciate them at their true worth. The light of the sun, which is the source of our life, and without which we cannot live for an hour, is also capable [Pg 145] of burning all things to ashes. So too, a king may do infinite good to his subjects, or be the source of untold mischief. Indeed, the body may be a good servant, but, when it becomes a master, its powers of evil are unlimited.
U||There is an incessant struggle going on within us between our Soul and Satan for the control of our body. If the soul gains the ascendancy, the body becomes a most potent instrument of good; but, if the devil is victorious in the struggle, it becomes a hot-bed of vice. Hell itself would be preferable to the body which is the slave of vice, which is constantly filled with decaying matter and which emits filthy odours, whose hands and feet are employed in unworthy deeds, whose tongue is employed in eating things that ought not to be eaten or in uttering language that ought not to be uttered, whose eyes are employed in seeing things that ought not to be seen, whose ears are employed in the hearing of things that ought not to be heard, and whose nose is employed in the smelling of things that ought not to be smelt. But, while hell is never mistaken for heaven by anybody, our body which is rendered worse than hell by ourselves is, strangely enough, regarded by us as almost heavenly! So monstrous is our vanity, an
U||d so pitiful our pride, in this matter! Those who make use of a palace as a [Pg 146] latrine, or vice versa, must certainly reap the fruit of their folly. So too, if, while our body is really in the Devil’s hands, we should fancy that we are enjoying true health, we shall have only ourselves to thank for the terrible consequences that are sure to follow.
U||To conclude, then our attempt in these pages has been to teach the great truth that perfect health can be attained only by living in obedience to the laws of God, and defying the power of Satan. True happiness is impossible without true health, and true health is impossible without a rigid control of the palate. All the other senses will automatically come under our control when the palate has been brought under control. And he who has conquered his senses has really conquered the whole world, and he becomes a part of God. We cannot realise Rama by reading the Ramayana, or Krishna by reading the Gita, or God by reading the Koran, or Christ by reading the Bible; the only means of realising them is by developing a pure and noble character. Character is based on virtuous action, and virtuous action is grounded on Truth. Truth, then, is the source and foundation of all things that are good and great. Hence, a fearless and unflinching pursuit of the ideal of Truth and Righteousness is the key-note of true health 
U||as of all else. And if we have succeeded (in however [Pg 147] feeble a measure) in bringing this grand fact home to our reader, our object in writing these pages would have been amply fulfilled.

U||Ganesan’s New Publications
U||THE FAILURE OF EUROPEAN CIVILISATION
U||By S. E. Stokes with Foreword by C. F. Andrews. 	Re. 1-0.
U||In this book Mr. Stokes shows how European civilisation by its prejudices of colour and race has miserably failed to satisfy the laws of true progress and needs of the modern world, and warns India of destroying her unique culture by falling a prey to white imperialism.
U||NATIONAL SELF-REALISATION
U||By S. E. Stokes 	Re. 1-8.
U||Students of current Indian politics and workers for Swaraj will find in this publication a very useful discussion of India’s ultimate goal and the methods of attaining it. The author though an American is well known as a sincere friend of the oppressed and to use the words of Mahatma Gandhi “Mr. Stokes is a convinced non-co-operator and a congressman. I think I am right in saying that he has come to it by slow degrees. No Indian is giving such battle to the Government as Mr. Stokes. He has veritably become the guide, philosopher and friend of the Hillmen”.
U||ESSAYS: POLITICAL AND NATIONAL
U||By S. E. Stokesv 	Rs. 2
U||This collection of essays is intended to stimulate thought on some of the important problems that India has to solve in the field of Education, religion and other aspects of national life.
U||THE TRUTH ABOUT INDIA
U||By H. M. Hyndman 	As. 12.
U||This small book gives the main facts about India’s plight under alien domination in a boldly frank and appealing manner. The pages breathe throughout the true Englishman’s inextinguishable fire of freedom and righteous indignation at oppression and exploitation of weak nations. The author exposes the methods by which British domination was established in India and discusses the political and economic effects of such rule, uttering grave words of warning against the final nemesis. The book deserves to be widely read and translated in the various vernaculars as a very necessary corrective to the distorted version of British Indian history taught in our schools.

U||INTRODUCTION
U||Les articles qu’on va lire sont un choix de l’immense production politique de Mahâtmâ Gandhi, entre les années 1919 et 1922.
U||On n’y doit point chercher l’art et la beauté d’expression. Gandhi en sait le prix; mais ici, il ne s’agit point d’art, du moins au sens restreint. C’est une action, et la plus puissante comme la plus neuve des actions. Si de la diriger fermement, comme un navire dans la tempête, vers le plus difficile et le plus glorieux des buts, est un art, alors nous dirons qu’en ce sens ces écrits sont du plus grand art.
U||Il importe de se représenter d’abord dans quelles circonstances ils ont paru.
U||Seul, chargé de l’écrasante responsabilité d’un peuple de trois cent millions d’hommes, de races, de religions, de langues différentes, la plupart incultes, et presque tous ultra-émotifs, réagissant violemment aux moindres excitations,—qu’il doit unifier, former et diriger,—ayant lancé dans ces masses humaines un mouvement sans précédent, qui se heurte à tout le statu quo de la pensée politique du monde, et où la moindre erreur d’aiguillage peut amener d’effroyables catastrophes,—le frêle Mahâtmâ à la volonté d’acier VI doit tout tenir dans sa main, voir, veiller, commander. Il n’est point question de polir une œuvre littéraire. Certes, Gandhi n’eût jamais songé à faire de ces articles un recueil. Les éditeurs hindous ont publié ce volume pendant son emprisonnement. N’y voyons pas un livre, mais une «geste» héroïque, où passent les éclairs de l’épée du dernier chevalier[1].
U||Écrire, parler, agir, sans relâche, sans répit. Ceux qui l’ont entendu m’ont conté ceci:
U||Le Mahâtmâ parle devant des milliers d’hommes. Il n’élève pas la voix. Il ne fait pas un geste. Il n’use d’aucun moyen oratoire. Il ne ménage rien. Il commence sans exorde et finit sans péroraison. Quand il a dit tout ce qu’il avait à dire,—peu ou beaucoup,—il cesse et il s’en va. La foule rugit ses acclamations. Dans le fracas, nul ne pourra plus se faire entendre avant longtemps.—Gandhi, le sourcil froncé,—(il hait les applaudissements et tout ce qui fait du bruit)—s’est assis dans un coin, étranger à ce peuple délirant qui l’acclame; il n’entend pas; déjà, il écrit l’article qui paraîtra dans le prochain numéro de son journal: Young India (La Jeune Inde).
U||Nous qui lisons l’article par delà les océans, tendons l’oreille! Nous percevrons, au loin, sous les mots refroidis, le peuple indien qui rugit.
U||*
U||*   *
U||La pensée de Gandhi paraît si claire et si explicite, VII elle a une telle aversion du voile, des réticences, des «à moitié dits», de tout ce qui, de près ou de loin, ressemble à un compromis, ou à une dissimulation, qu’il semblerait qu’il n’y eût qu’à laisser le public en contact immédiat avec elle.
U||«J’ai toujours développé au grand jour, écrit-il, mes plans les plus hardis... Je hais le secret comme un crime... Je remercie Dieu de ce que depuis longtemps je considère le secret comme un péché, surtout en matière politique... Jamais une restriction mentale!...»[2]
U||Je devrais d’autant plus me retirer à l’arrière-plan que j’ai longuement expliqué la mission du Mahâtmâ et la caractéristique de son génie dans un petit volume, qui est maintenant répandu et traduit dans toutes les langues d’Europe, et, dans l’Inde même, en trois langues. Je le dis sans amour-propre: car tout le secret de la diffusion universelle de ce livre est dans le rayonnement de «la Grande Ame»[3], derrière laquelle je me suis effacé. Et c’est ce que je devrais faire encore aujourd’hui.
U||Mais depuis que ce livre a paru, j’ai eu occasion d’en reviser les idées, par des entretiens nombreux et une correspondance suivie avec des Indiens de tous les partis, avec des témoins européens dans l’Inde, et même avec le Mahâtmâ, maintenant sorti de prison. En relisant ses articles dans cette traduction, j’ai revu sous un nouveau jour certaines de ses pensées; j’en ai aperçu la complexité, et parfois les divers plans superposés; le caractère tragique s’est encore accentué. Je voudrais faire part au lecteur de mes nouvelles découvertes.—Mais VIII il est bien entendu que ce que j’écris ici, dans cette Introduction ne supplée point à mon étude plus complète. C’est au volume sur Mahatma Gandhi qu’un lecteur, désireux de connaître la vie du Mahâtmâ, devra recourir.
U||*
U||*   *
U||Ces articles débutent, au premier Jour de l’An Gujerate, octobre 1919, par un Appel aux énergies morales les plus héroïques d’un peuple. Après une vie de dures expériences pratiques et de méditations passionnées—(il a maintenant cinquante ans)—Gandhi se décide à dire à l’Inde son Evangile, la parole d’action religieuse, qui ouvre à son peuple la voie sanglante et glorieuse,—le Satyâgraha. Pour qui se donne la peine de comprendre le sens exact de ce que demande le Mahâtmâ, il ne s’agit de rien moins que de faire surgir un peuple-Christ, qui se sacrifie pour son salut et pour celui de l’humanité.
U||Assistons-nous donc à l’apparition d’un prophète, qui apporte un nouveau Credo?
U||Il faut voir de plus près. On sait avec quelle aversion Gandhi rejette tout titre supranaturel, qui «devrait être rayé de la vie actuelle»[4]. Ni prophète ni saint. Il n’est pas un surhomme, et il ne veut pas l’être. Pour son compte personnel, il peut avoir son Credo, et il l’a. Mais, «humble serviteur de l’Inde, et ne prétendant à rien de plus», il ne lui impose pas des vérités révélées. Il cherche, et il expérimente ce qui, dans le champ de l’observation directe, peut la sauver.
U||IX
U||Ce mot d’«expérimentation», qui revient constamment dans ce livre[5], doit être mis en lumière. Il n’a été saisi, ni par ses partisans, ni par ses adversaires, parce que des deux côtés il s’adressait à des hommes passionnés. Et moi-même, je ne l’ai pas assez souligné.
U||Gandhi, dont l’horizon de pensée s’étend bien au-delà de son pays,—quoique l’Inde soit son principal amour,—Gandhi qui, par son éducation européenne, par les vingt-trois ans qu’il a passés hors de l’Inde, s’est acquis une vision complète du monde, à l’heure actuelle, conçoit, comme beaucoup d’entre nous, de graves appréhensions sur l’avenir de l’humanité. Elle lui semble traverser une crise périlleuse, où rien ne nous assure que le plus précieux d’elle-même ne périra pas. Cette pensée ne lui laisse pas de repos; et s’il s’adresse à l’Inde, il songe à tous les hommes, que l’Inde doit sauver. Son amour même pour elle, sa fierté indienne, assigne à sa patrie ce devoir redoutable[6].
U||Or, de moyens de salut, il ne voit plus qu’un seul: la Non-Violence. Ce n’est pourtant pas le seul qu’il ait jamais conçu. Sans doute, pour son compte propre, il n’en emploiera jamais d’autre[7]. Mais, pour l’humanité actuelle, encore si arriérée, il ne condamne pas la violence, en soi; on peut dire que, naguère, il a même accepté, dans une certaine mesure, d’y coopérer, puisqu’il a recruté des troupes pour l’Angleterre; il en a, X en tout cas, laissé faire l’essai; et tout ce qu’il exige de ceux qui y recourent aujourd’hui, c’est qu’ils le fassent loyalement et sans hypocrisie. Seulement, il s’est convaincu, d’après sa longue expérience, que cet essai est ruineux et qu’il mène au désastre de l’humanité. La Violence est un chemin qui débouche fatalement sur l’abîme. A ceux qui veulent échapper, la seule route qui reste ouverte est la Non-Violence.
U||Entendons-nous: Gandhi ne dit pas qu’elle sauvera maintenant l’humanité. Il ne sait pas si l’humanité d’aujourd’hui sera sauvée[8]. Mais si elle l’est, ce ne peut être que par la Non-Violence.
U||C’est une expérimentation: la dernière. Elle serait désespérée, si, pour un solitaire de l’Inde, qui a toujours le refuge de l’Infini, plus réel que ce monde de combats, il ne restait la ressource de revenir aux mains du «Divin Potier»[9].
U||*
U||*   *
U||Revenons sur ces traits. Les textes mêmes du Mahâtmâ en montreront l’intensité tragique.
U||«... Je n’ai d’autre prétention, annonce-t-il, au début de sa campagne (12 mai 1920), que de chercher la vérité. Je suis un homme qui sait ce qui lui manque, qui se trompe, et qui n’hésite jamais à le reconnaître. J’avoue franchement XI que, pareil à l’homme de science, je fais des expériences sur certaines vérités éternelles de la vie; mais je ne peux même pas prétendre à être un homme de science, car je ne puis donner aucune preuve évidente de l’exactitude scientifique de mes méthodes, ni des résultats tangibles de mes expériences»[10].
U||Il ne s’agit donc pas d’une Révélation. Il s’agit d’une hypothèse sociale, d’une loi entrevue, non démontrée encore, d’une «énergie nouvelle», qu’il croit avoir découverte, ou plutôt retrouvée, à la suite des anciens Rishis, et qu’il compare à l’électricité[11]. C’est la Loi d’Amour, la force de Satyâgraha.
U||Sur quoi repose-t-elle?—Sur des observations nombreuses, accumulées par Gandhi pendant vingt-cinq ans,—sur une expérience surprenante, celle de l’Afrique du Sud, où un peuple opprimé arracha les droits qui lui étaient dûs à des maîtres résolus à les lui refuser et disposant de toutes les forces matérielles, de l’armée, XII des tribunaux, et de l’opinion publique excitée par la presse. Cette expérience, timidement commencée par une poignée de sacrifices, aboutit brusquement à un formidable élan: quarante mille hommes et femmes s’offrant à la prison. Et la victoire fut gagnée, sans qu’il y eût de sang versé,—«uniquement par une discipline énergique de souffrance personnelle»[12].
U||Quelle est donc cette arme nouvelle, qui brise les tanks et les canons?—«L’épée du sacrifice de soi.» (15 décembre 1921).
U||Remarquez ce mot d’«épée». Gandhi lui-même le souligne, et le reprend, à diverses reprises. Il l’oppose à «l’épée d’acier», lame contre lame.—Qui parle de bras croisés, d’acceptation bêlante? Gandhi est profondément sûr que l’Angleterre ne cédera aux demandes de l’Inde «que lorsque l’épée l’y aura forcée».—Mais cette épée invincible: un peuple qui s’offre à la mort.
U||Quel non-sens d’avoir jamais pu confondre ce paroxysme de l’action avec la race ovine des pacifistes passifs! Il n’y a pas un grain de passivité dans l’être d’un Gandhi. Tout est «action directe.»... «Rien, sur cette terre, n’a jamais été accompli sans action directe»[13]. Elle ne lui paraît pas seulement nécessaire pour la victoire d’une cause ou d’une idée. Elle est même un bienfait pour celui qui l’emploie, une hygiène de l’âme; elle lui donne l’équilibre, le sentiment de sa force; elle le préserve de la rancune amère et impuissante[14].
U||XIII
U||Certes, le remède est héroïque. Mais il n’est pas contre nature. Gandhi, en l’indiquant, part d’une observation de savant mystique sur la loi de Souffrance dans la nature:—«La vie sort de la mort. Pour que le blé pousse, il faut que le grain périsse.... La loi de souffrance est inhérente à notre être...» Tout ce que nous pouvons faire, c’est de la prendre toute sur nous, et de l’épargner à nos ennemis. «Le progrès dépend de la somme de souffrance endurée.... Plus la souffrance est pure, plus le progrès est grand...» Il faut «apprendre à souffrir volontairement et à y trouver de la joie.... La liberté ne saurait s’acquérir qu’à ce prix»[15].
U||On voit si le Mahâtmâ est un affaiblisseur d’énergie! Il la soumet au contraire aux disciplines les plus rudes qui jamais aient été imposées à un peuple. Mais il souffle à ce peuple l’ardeur de les accepter avec allégresse. Il l’exalte. Il tend l’énergie humaine jusqu’à l’extrême limite, où la corde semble près de se briser. Mais où n’atteindra point la flèche de l’arc ainsi tendu!
U||On comprend qu’un tel archer de la Non-Violence, le porte-glaive du Sacrifice de soi, n’ait point de mépris pour les tenants loyaux de la violence,—tout en condamnant leur erreur. J’ai cité, dans mon petit livre (p. 54) ces passages saisissants, où «plutôt que lâcheté il conseille violence!»—Il va plus loin: il est «d’avis que ceux qui croient à la violence apprennent le maniement des armes»[16]. Car c’est une autre expérimentation, «celle à laquelle le monde s’est habitué depuis des siècles»; et si XIV on l’adopte, il faut au moins qu’elle soit bien conduite et complète: ainsi, «ce serait une méthode raisonnable, vraie et franche»[17].—On a bien lu ce mot: «raisonnable», appliqué à la violence par ce Rishi de la Non-Violence! C’est dire que, s’il la rejette, ce n’est pas par défaillance de cœur devant les moyens qu’elle emploie, c’est par certitude de jugement qu’elle n’atteint pas et qu’elle est incapable d’atteindre à son but,—aux effet
U||s foudroyants qu’obtient «la Non-Violence sous sa forme dynamique», où «l’âme entière résiste à la volonté du tyran. Un seul individu qui agirait selon cette loi fondamentale pourrait défier la puissance entière d’un empire injuste..., et amener plus tard la chute de cet empire ou sa régénération»[18].
U||Ajoutons qu’en faisant sonner cette trompette de Jéricho, Gandhi ne fait que reprendre l’expérience des Rishis qui, «s’étant eux-mêmes servis des armes, en comprirent l’inutilité et, plus grands génies que Newton, plus grands guerriers que Wellington, découvrirent et enseignèrent au monde la Loi de Non-Violence»[19].
U||*
U||*   *
U||La Non-Violence est donc un combat. Et, comme tous les combats,—si grand que soit le chef,—l’issue reste douteuse. L’expérimentation que va tenter Gandhi est terrible, terriblement dangereuse. Et il le sait, lui qui redoute la fureur de la populace indienne qu’il déchaîne, plus que la tyrannie de l’adversaire anglais[20].—Mais XV il faut oser. «L’essence de l’expérimentateur est d’oser». Gandhi a appris de l’Occident «l’énergie», et il veut l’inoculer à l’Inde[21].—«Aucun général digne de ce nom ne renonce à la bataille, par la crainte des revers ou des erreurs»[22]. Il se recueille, il médite, il prépare, et il ose.—Gandhi ose. Son audace va très loin. En août 1920, il refuse d’attendre le vote du Congrès, qui représente la nation, pour déclencher l’action expérimentale de Non-Coopération:—«Quand on possède la foi en une action, attendre que le Congrès (c’est-à-dire la nation) se prononce serait folie. Il faut au contraire agir et démontre
U||r l’efficacité de son action, afin de décider la nation à l’adopter»[23]... «La meilleure façon de servir la nation» est parfois d’agir à l’opposé de ses opinions.
U||Mais s’il se trompe? Eh bien, que tout retombe sur lui! Il sera écrasé. Bien entendu, s’il agit en dehors du Congrès, ce n’est pas au nom du Congrès, c’est à ses risques et périls. Il saura porter tout entière la responsabilité de sa défaite.
U||«Je me considérerais comme indigne de diriger une cause, si je craignais de ne pouvoir la conduire au succès... Mais la doctrine qui veut le travail dans le détachement signifie aussi bien la recherche inexorable de la vérité que le retour sur ses pas si l’on s’est trompé, ou la renonciation au rôle de chef lorsqu’on découvre qu’on n’en est pas digne»[24].
U||Ce n’est pas d’un cœur léger qu’il envisage une telle éventualité.
U||XVI
U||«Supposez, écrit-il, que malgré mes espérances, rien n’arrive de ce que j’attends, ne devrais-je pas sentir que je ne suis plus digne de diriger la lutte? Ne devrais-je pas m’agenouiller humblement devant mon Créateur et lui demander de me délivrer de mon corps inutile et de faire de moi un instrument plus capable de servir?»...[25]
U||On peut imaginer ses angoisses secrètes et ses déchirements. La confession publique, qui suivit les crimes de Chauri-Chaura[26], en révèle une heure d’agonie. Il se relève pourtant. Il ne renonce jamais. Il sait bien qu’il ne le peut pas. Le navire, près de sombrer, ne peut se passer de lui. Il est le pilote. Il faut qu’il reste au poste. Il faut qu’il continue d’oser. Ce n’est pas seulement pour l’Inde que vaut sa redoutable expérimentation, c’est pour toutes les races humaines. Il a un très beau mot, qu’il reprend à un antique Rishi inconnu:
U||«Yatthaa pindhé thatthaa brahmandé»
U||«Comme il en est d’une boule de glaise, ainsi en est-il de tout l’univers».
U||Il expérimente sur la boule de glaise. Et certes, il ne s’illusionne pas sur les limites de son pouvoir! Mais, fais ce que dois!...
U||Et il tend la main au monde, pour s’entraider. Aux Anglais. Aux Chrétiens. A ses ennemis mêmes. Ennemis? Il n’en a point. «A tout Anglais qui habite l’Inde» il écrit: «Cher ami»[27]. Il fait appel aux Européens. Il XVII correspond affectueusement avec les chrétiens[28]. Il ne lutte pas contre eux. Il travaille pour eux, pour le christianisme même, que l’Europe trahit[29].
U||*
U||*   *
U||J’ai tâché de bien dégager aux yeux du lecteur, le caractère de la bataille engagée et la nature de l’enjeu. On se rendra mieux compte ensuite, en étudiant le livre, du génie dépensé par cet «idéaliste pratique», comme il aime à se nommer[30], dans la réalisation de son grand Dessein. Il a ce don, très rare, chez les croyants passionnés, de lire dans la pensée des autres. Il est doué de la faculté «polypsychologique» de parler à chacun sa langue et, par un juste sens des natures diverses, de ne faire appel à leurs meilleures forces que dans le cercle propre de compréhension et d’action qui est dévolu à chaque être. C’est ce qui explique que, pour son compte, embrassant dans son cœur toute l’humanité, il parle aux Sikhs le langage patriotique, et qu’à ceux qui veulent prendre les armes il enseigne à employer ces armes pour leur pays[31]. Ainsi XVIII qu’il l’écrit à Tagore, son travail est de «transformer le sens des vieilles expressions: nationalisme et patrio
U||tisme, en les élargissant».
U||Aussi, n’essaie-t-il même pas de réaliser la Non-Violence absolue ou «parfaite», qui est sa foi personnelle, mais la Non-Violence sous la «forme restreinte, seule possible actuellement», qui est la «Non-Violence politique de Non-Coopération»,—méthode raisonnée de Révolution paisible et progressive, qui doit conduire au Swarâj, c’est-à-dire au Home Rule de l’Inde[32].
U||Chacun de ses articles est comme un ordre de bataille, dont il explique le sens, soit à ses lieutenants, soit au gros de son armée, soit à ses ennemis mêmes, car il ne croit pas inutile de s’adresser au bon sens et à la bonne foi de ceux que l’on combat[33].
U||Et rien n’est admirable comme la mesure avec laquelle il allie, dans ses controverses, la modération XIX des manières, la tranquillité et la courtoisie parfaite de l’expression, avec la franchise absolue et l’assurance implacable[34].
U||Cet homme doux et poli exerce sur ses armées une autorité dictatoriale. Jamais chef populaire, idolâtré par la foule, n’a parlé d’elle avec plus de mépris. Il est telle de ses phrases que n’eût pas désavouée le Coriolan de Shakespeare:
U||«Je suis écœuré de l’adoration de la multitude. Je serais plus sûr d’avoir raison, si elle crachait sur moi[35]... Mieux vaut être qualifié d’autocrate que d’avoir l’air de se laisser influencer par la multitude afin qu’elle vous approuve... Il ne suffit pas de protester contre l’opinion générale. Il est nécessaire que, dans les grandes questions, les chefs agissent en sens inverse de l’opinion de la masse, si cette opinion ne se recommande pas à leur raison»[36].
U||Mais ce dédain héroïque recouvre plus d’amour vrai du peuple que les flatteries intéressées des démagogues. Gandhi croit qu’une volonté haute peut transformer un peuple, en ne craignant pas d’exiger de lui les plus durs sacrifices[37]; et il lui impose une vigoureuse discipline morale,—cette discipline dont le relâchement fait la mortelle faiblesse des armées révolutionnaires d’aujourd’hui, et qui a fait la force de celles du passé. Les troupes de Cromwell ont entendu des ordres du jour semblables à ceux du Mahâtmâ, enjoignant «la nécessité de l’humilité», de la propreté physique et morale, le respect de la femme, interdisant la boisson, XX flétrissant le «péché du secret», le mensonge,—moins: la demi-vérité. Et le génial Protecteur de la République d’Angleterre n’a pas moins que Gandhi connu les forces mystiques de l’homme. Il y a fait appel; et il leur a dû en partie ses victoires.
U||*
U||*   *
U||On me reprochera d’insister, dans cette Introduction aux articles de Gandhi, sur leur caractère de combat.
U||J’ai voulu rompre un malentendu, qui enclave Gandhi dans le pacifisme énervé. Si le Christ a été le Prince de la Paix, Gandhi n’est pas indigne de ce beau nom. Mais la paix que l’un et l’autre apportent aux hommes n’est pas celle de l’acceptation passive, elle est celle de l’amour agissant et du sacrifice de soi. J’ai osé montrer qu’il y a moins de distance entre la Non-Violence du Mahâtmâ et la Violence des Révolutionnaires, qui sont ses francs adversaires, qu’entre la Non-Acceptation héroïque et la servile ataraxie des éternels Acceptants, qui sont le béton de toutes les tyrannies et le ciment de toutes les réactions.
U||Il y a quelques semaines, après de longs débats à la Chambre Française à propos de l’Amnistie, les pouvoirs publics, pauvrement combattus d’ailleurs par une opposition, médiocre en nombre et médiocre en pensée, refusèrent de comprendre dans la grâce accordée les Réfractaires par conscience,—établissant pour mesure de leur amnistie qu’elle ne devait s’appliquer qu’à ceux qui ont combattu.
U||Les politiciens ont des œillères. Ils ne se doutent pas que dans le monde d’aujourd’hui, il est plus d’un XXI combat; et le plus héroïque n’est plus celui qui se livre au front des armées nationales. Il leur plaît d’ignorer. Qu’ils regardent autour d’eux! Qu’ils regardent devant eux, ce qui se prépare dans l’avenir: luttes révolutionnaires, luttes de classes, luttes de races! Et la plus haute de toutes: lutte des âmes, guerre de l’Ame!
U||Nous leur offrons ici le spectacle de cet autre combat, qui, de l’Inde, se propagera peu à peu sur la terre. Qu’ils l’accablent, s’ils veulent! Qu’ils le déshonorent, s’ils peuvent! Ainsi Rome voulut faire avec les premiers chrétiens. Il fallut bien, un jour, qu’elle transigeât avec eux: «In hoc signo vinces»...—Il est vrai qu’ensuite elle les acheta.
U||Mais nous n’en sommes pas là. Historien de métier, habitué à voir passer et repasser le flux et le reflux des grandes marées de l’Esprit, je décris celle-ci qui se lève, du fond de l’Orient. Elle ne se retirera qu’après avoir recouvert les rivages de l’Europe.

U||LA JEUNE INDE
U||L’AURORE DU SATYAGRAHA SUR L’INDE
U||(Article paru dans le Nava Jivan du 26 octobre 1919, premier jour de l’an dans la province de Gujerate).
U||Sonnons les cloches pour l’année qui s’en va,
U||Sonnons les cloches pour l’année qui vient!
U||Le bilan de l’année passée est difficile à établir. La guerre a pris fin, mais sans grand profit; les espérances qu’elle avait nourries ont été déçues. La paix qui devait être une paix durable n’est une paix que de nom. Il est démontré que cette guerre, plus importante que la guerre du Mahâbhârata n’a été que le prélude d’une autre guerre plus importante encore. Un mécontentement général s’est étendu sur 2 la France, sur l’Amérique et sur l’Angleterre. Tout ce qui a suivi semble une énigme monstrueuse. Aux Indes nous ne voyons de tous côtés que désespoir. On espérait avec confiance qu’après la guerre l’Inde obtiendrait un résultat sérieux, et cet espoir a été déçu. Il est fort possible, pour ce qu’on en sait, que les réformes attendues[38] n’aient point lieu; et même si elles avaient lieu, elles ne serviraient à rien. Le projet de la Ligue du Congrès et du Congrès de Delhi, et tous ceux qui ont suivi, ne sont plus à présent que des paroles en l
U||’air. Il nous faut attendre, afin de voir ce qu’amèneront les événements. Le Pendjab a été le théâtre de scènes révoltantes; des existences innocentes ont été sacrifiées. La terreur a régné. Le gouffre qui sépare les administrateurs des administrés s’est élargi. Il est impossible, dans de telles questions, d’établir un bilan exact. A combien se monte le crédit? Y a-t-il quelque chose au débit, et si oui qu’y a-t-il? Ou bien n’y a-t-il rien au crédit, et ne nous reste-t-il qu’à faire le total des chiffres au débit?
U||A un nuage de désespoir aussi dense et aussi sombre, se peut-il qu’il y ait un envers brillant? Le 6 Avril, se leva sur l’Inde entière le soleil du Satyâgraha[39]. Les nuages se dispersèrent et l’on vit distinctement les rayons. Seulement il y eut au Pendjab et à Ahmedabad une éclipse, et les ténèbres 3 nous hantent encore. Malgré tout, on voit de nouveau le Satyâgraha poindre lentement dans la plupart des esprits. Le 17 octobre un hartal[40] se fit dans diverses parties de l’Inde, au milieu d’un calme et d’une paix absolus. Les fidèles passèrent la journée en jeûnes et en prières. Les Hindous prirent part au deuil des Musulmans, fortifiant l’espoir de ces derniers et en même temps les liens qui les unissent à eux—liens qu’il serait à présent bien difficile de briser.
U||Si quelqu’un demandait quel fut l’événement le plus important de l’année passée, nous répondrions sans la moindre hésitation: «Ce fut l’accueil fait au Satyâgraha», si infime ait-il été, consciemment ou inconsciemment, par ceux qui dirigent aussi bien que par ceux qui obéissent. Et pour le prouver, nous rappellerions le 17 octobre[41].
U||Dans le Satyâgraha est tout l’espoir de l’Inde. Et qu’est-ce que le Satyâgraha? Il a souvent été décrit; mais de même que le soleil ne peut l’être complètement même par le serpent Sheshaga[42] aux mille langues, le soleil du Satyâgraha ne saurait se décrire d’une façon satisfaisante. Nous voyons toujours le soleil et pourtant nous n’en savons pas grand chose; de même il nous semble apercevoir sans cesse le soleil du Satyâgraha, mais nous le connaissons bien peu.
U||4
U||Les sphères d’activité du Satyâgraha sont le Swadeshi[43], les Réformes politiques et sociales dont la durée n’est assurée qu’autant qu’elles s’appuient sur le Satyâgraha. Le chemin qui mène au Satyâgraha est différent du chemin battu et n’est pas toujours facile à découvrir. Peu de gens s’y sont aventurés, les empreintes des pas sont rares, indistinctes, espacées, ce qui explique pourquoi on le redoute. Néanmoins nous voyons nettement que certains s’acheminent vers lui, ne serait-ce que très lentement.
U||Celui pour qui le Satyâgraha n’est que Désobéissance Civile ne l’a jamais compris[44]. Mais celui-là seul qui sait construire a le droit de détruire. Le poète a chanté:
U||«Le sentier de la Vérité est le sentier des braves,
U||Il est inaccessible aux lâches».
U||Le Swadeshi est Satyâgraha. Les esprits lâches ne sauraient ni l’observer ni le propager. Il est impossible à un lâche de favoriser l’Union Hindoue-Musulmane. Il ne faut pas être un Musulman lâche pour s’exposer au poignard Hindou, ou vice versa et pour conserver son équilibre moral. Si l’un et l’autre pouvaient arriver à un peu de tolérance, on obtiendrait immédiatement le Swarâj[45] (l’autonomie). Nul ne peut s’opposer à ce que nous prenions 5 le sentier du Satyâgraha; et comme le Swadeshi et l’Union Hindoue-Musulmane sont ainsi, par essence, religieux, l’Inde accomplirait incidemment un acte de religion. Voici donc quelle sera notre prière pour l’année nouvelle:
U||«Seigneur, guidez l’Inde vers le sentier de la Vérité, enseignez-lui pour cela la religion du Swadeshi, et resserrez l’union des Hindous, des Musulmans, des Parsis, des Chrétiens et des Juifs qui vivent dans l’Inde!»
U||5 novembre 1919.
U||LE MOUVEMENT DU SATYAGRAHA
U||Un Aperçu du Mouvement.
U||Rapport soumis par Gandhi au Comité de Lord Hunter qui étudiait les débuts du Mouvement du Satyâgraha dans l’Inde.
U||Principes généraux.—Voici trente ans que je prêche le Satyâgraha et que je le pratique[46]. Les principes du Satyâgraha, tel qu’il est aujourd’hui, constituent une évolution progressive.
U||6
U||Le Satyâgraha diffère autant de la Résistance Passive que le Pôle Nord du Pôle Sud. Conçue pour être l’arme des faibles, cette dernière pour atteindre son but n’exclut pas la force ou la violence physiques, alors que le premier conçu pour être l’arme du plus fort rejette l’emploi de la violence, sous quelque forme que ce soit.
U||Le mot Satyâgraha fut créé par moi, alors que je me trouvais dans l’Afrique du Sud, pour exprimer la force employée là-bas par les Indiens pendant huit années entières, afin de distinguer ce mouvement de celui qui existait à cette époque dans le Royaume Uni et dans l’Afrique du Sud sous le nom de Résistance Passive.
U||Etymologiquement, le mot signifie: se retenir à la Vérité—d’où, Force de Vérité. Je l’ai appelée également Force d’Ame ou Force d’Amour. En pratiquant le Satyâgraha, je m’aperçus rapidement que la recherche de la Vérité n’admettait point qu’on eût recours à la violence contre son adversaire et qu’il fallait arriver à le tirer de l’erreur par la patience et la sympathie: car ce qui paraît Vérité à l’un peut sembler erreur à l’autre. Et la patience implique la souffrance personnelle. La doctrine en vint donc à représenter qu’on défend la Vérité non pas en faisant souffrir son adversaire, mais en souffrant soi-même.
U||Dans le domaine de la politique, lutter dans l’intérêt du peuple consiste surtout à combattre l’erreur manifestée sous forme de lois injustes. Lorsque, par des pétitions et autres méthodes analogues, vous avez échoué dans votre tentative pour démontrer au législateur qu’il se trompe, il ne vous reste d’autre 7 moyen, si vous ne voulez pas vous soumettre à l’erreur, que celui de le contraindre par la force brutale à s’avouer vaincu, ou de souffrir vous-même personnellement en vous exposant à la peine encourue pour infraction à la loi. Il s’ensuit que le Satyâgraha apparaît d’une façon générale aux yeux du public comme une Désobéissance Civile ou une Résistance Civile; elle est civile, en ce sens qu’elle n’est pas criminelle.
U||Le criminel enfreint les lois subrepticement et tâche de se soustraire au châtiment; tout autrement agit celui qui résiste civilement. Il se montre toujours respectueux des lois de l’Etat auquel il appartient, non par crainte des sanctions, mais parce qu’il considère ces lois nécessaires au bien de la société. Seulement, en certaines circonstances, assez rares, la loi est si injuste qu’obéir semblerait un déshonneur. Alors, ouvertement et civilement, il viole la loi et subit avec calme la peine encourue pour cette infraction. Puis, afin d’affirmer sa protestation contre l’action des législateurs, il lui reste la possibilité de refuser sa coopération à l’Etat, en désobéissant à d’autres lois dont l’infraction n’entraîne pas de déchéance morale.
U||Selon moi, la beauté et la puissance du Satyâgraha sont si grandes et la doctrine en est si simple qu’on peut la prêcher même aux enfants. Je l’ai prêchée à des milliers d’hommes, de femmes et d’enfants, appelés communément Indiens «liés par Contrat»[47] et j’ai obtenu d’excellents résultats.
U||Projets de lois Rowlatt.—Lorsque les lois Rowlatt[48] 8 furent promulguées, j’eus le sentiment qu’elles portaient une telle atteinte à la liberté de l’homme qu’il fallait faire tout ce qui était possible pour les combattre. Je remarquai également que tous les Indiens s’y opposaient. J’avancerai l’opinion qu’aucun Etat, si despotique qu’il soit, n’a le droit de décréter des lois qui répugnent à la masse entière d’un peuple, encore moins un gouvernement comme le Gouvernement Indien, soumis à des coutumes et des précédents constitutionnels. J’eus également l’impression que l’agitation qui s’annonçait aurait besoin d’être guidée vers un but défini pour ne pas prendre un cours trop violent ou s’écrouler complètement.
U||Le 6 avril.—Je me hasardai donc à faire connaître le Satyâgraha au pays, en insistant sur son caractère de Résistance Civile; et comme ce mouvement est essentiellement intérieur et purificateur, je suggérai une journée de jeûne et de prière et l’arrêt de tout travail, pour le 6 avril. Cette proposition fut accueillie avec un enthousiasme merveilleux dans toutes les parties de l’Inde, bien qu’il n’y eût aucune organisation et peu de préparatifs: l’idée avait été communiquée simplement au public dès qu’elle m’était venue à l’esprit. Le 6 avril, le peuple n’employa aucune violence; aucune rencontre qui vaille la peine d’être mentionnée n’eut lieu avec la police. Le hartal fut essentiellement volontaire et spontané.
U||On m’arrête.—L’observance du 6 avril devait être suivie de Désobéissance Civile. Le Comité du Satyâgraha 9 Sabha[49] avait choisi à cet effet certaines lois politiques. Nous nous mîmes à distribuer des livres et brochures prohibées d’un caractère absolument sain: une brochure écrite par moi sur le Home Rule, une traduction du livre de Ruskin: Unto this last, La défense et la mort de Socrate, etc.
U||Désordre.—Il n’est pas douteux certainement que le 6 avril trouva l’Inde douée d’une force vitale plus grande qu’elle n’en avait montré jusqu’alors. Les gens habituellement terrifiés cessèrent de craindre l’autorité. D’autre part, les masses étaient jusque là demeurées inertes. Les chefs n’avaient réellement exercé sur elles aucune influence. Elles n’étaient point disciplinées. Elles venaient de découvrir une force nouvelle, mais ignoraient en quoi elle consistait et ne savaient pas comment l’employer.
U||A Delhi, les chefs eurent du mal à contenir un très grand nombre de gens qui jusque-là étaient demeurés indifférents. Le Dr Satyapal désirait ardemment que j’allasse à Amritsar, afin de montrer au peuple le caractère pacifique du Satyâgraha. Swami Shraddhanandji de Delhi et le Dr Satyapal d’Amritsar m’écrivirent tous deux, en me priant de venir dans leurs villes, afin de pacifier le peuple et de lui expliquer le caractère du Satyâgraha. Je n’étais jamais allé à Amritsar ni d’ailleurs au Pendjab. Ces invitations passèrent sous les yeux des autorités qui savaient que j’étais invité, dans des intentions pacifiques.
U||Je quittai Bombay pour Delhi et le Pendjab le 8 Avril. J’avais envoyé au Dr Satyapal, que je ne 10 connaissais pas, un télégramme le priant de venir à ma rencontre à Delhi. Mais après avoir passé Mutra, je reçus un ordre de la Police m’interdisant de pénétrer dans la province de Delhi. Il m’était impossible de tenir compte de cet ordre et je poursuivis mon voyage. Arrivé à Palval, je reçus un ordre m’interdisant l’entrée du Pendjab et me confinant dans la présidence de Bombay. Un groupe de gens de la police me força de descendre du train à cette gare et m’arrêta. Le surveillant chargé de m’arrêter le fit avec beaucoup de courtoisie. Je fus reconduit à Mutra par le premier train, puis à l’aube par le train de marchandises jusqu’à Siwali Madhupur, où je rejoignis l’express de Bombay. On me rendit ma liberté à Bombay, le 10 avril.
U||Mais les gens d’Ahmedabad et de Viramgam et, d’une façon générale, de la province de Gujerate avaient appris mon arrestation. Ils devinrent furieux et fermèrent leurs boutiques. Il y eut des rassemblements, des meurtres, du pillage, et des tentatives pour faire dérailler les trains.
U||Causes.—J’avais travaillé récemment pour la cause, au milieu des raiyats[50] de Kaira et fréquenté des milliers d’hommes et de femmes. J’avais travaillé avec Miss Ansuya Sarabhai parmi les ouvriers des filatures. Ceux-ci appréciaient son œuvre philanthropique et l’adoraient. La fureur des ouvriers atteignit son paroxysme, lorsque le faux bruit se répandit qu’elle avait été arrêtée également. Nous avions fait certaines démarches, elle et moi, pour les ouvriers de Viramgam et intercédé pour eux lorsqu’ils avaient 11 été inquiétés, et je crois fermement que les excès commis furent causés par le grand ressentiment de la foule en apprenant mon arrestation et le bruit de l’arrestation de Miss Ansuya Sarabhai.
U||J’ai fréquenté les masses à peu près partout dans l’Inde et me suis entretenu librement avec elles; je ne puis croire qu’il y ait eu un mouvement révolutionnaire derrière les excès commis. On ne peut les honorer du nom de rébellion.
U||Mesures prises.—Selon moi, le gouvernement a eu tort d’accuser les coupables d’avoir déclaré la guerre. Cette opinion a causé des souffrances disproportionnées et imméritées. L’amende imposée à la pauvre ville d’Ahmedabad était excessive et la façon de la faire payer par les ouvriers inutilement dure et vexatoire. Je doute qu’il ait été juste d’exiger une amende aussi forte (176.000) roupies à des ouvriers. Et l’obligation de payer les frais imposée aux fermiers de Baredji et aux Banias et Patidars[51] de Nadiad était une mesure vindicative que rien ne justifiait. Rien ne justifiait non plus, selon moi, que la loi martiale fût établie à Ahmedabad, et la façon inconsidérée dont elle fut appliquée causa la perte de plusieurs existences innocentes.
U||Cependant, et sous réserve de ce que j’ai dit précédemment, je ne doute pas que dans la Présidence de Bombay les autorités n’aient agi avec une grande modération, à un moment où l’atmosphère était surchargée de méfiance réciproque et où la tentative de faire dérailler le train qui amenait les troupes pour le 12 rétablissement de l’ordre venait avec raison de les irriter...
U||(Jeune Inde, 5 novembre 1919 et jours suivants).
U||POUR LE CALIFAT
U||Discours prononcé en Urdu par Gandhi, à la session commune de la Conférence qu’il présidait, de toute l’Inde pour le Califat[52].
U||«Il ne devrait point paraître étrange de voir réunis sur la même estrade des Hindous et des Mahométans pour discuter une question concernant uniquement ces derniers. Un témoignage d’amitié est une aide 14 véritable dans l’adversité; et que nous soyons Hindous, Parsis, Chrétiens ou Juifs, si nous voulons former une seule nation, les intérêts de l’un doivent être les intérêts de tous. La seule chose à considérer, c’est l’équité d’une cause. Le Premier Ministre anglais et toute sa phalange d’anciens hauts fonctionnaires peuvent témoigner de la justice de la cause musulmane. Nous parlons de l’Union Hindoue-Musulmane. Cette expression n’aurait aucun sens si les Hindous se tenaient à l’écart des Mahométans, lorsque l’intérêt vital de ces derniers est en jeu. Certains ont suggéré que nous autres Hindous ne pouvions aider nos compatriotes mahométans qu’à de certaines conditions. Une aide conditionnelle est comme du ciment adultéré qui ne tient pas. La seule que
U||stion qui se pose est de savoir comment il nous est possible d’aider. La conférence pour le Califat a décidé de ne pas prendre part aux cérémonies qui auront lieu prochainement pour célébrer la paix. Je trouve cette décision fort juste: célébrer la paix ne peut avoir aucun sens pour l’Inde, tant qu’une partie vitale de cette paix, affectant le quart de la population indienne, reste en suspens. Quatre-vingt millions de Mahométans s’intéressent aux clauses de la paix qui concerne le Califat. Il est malséant de leur demander 15 de célébrer la paix, alors que cette question est encore dans la balance. Compter que l’Inde le fasse dans ces conditions serait s’attendre avoir la France célébrer la paix, pendant que le sort de l’Alsace-Lorraine est incertain. Que la Turquie ne fasse point partie de l’Inde ne change en rien la question. L’Angleterre est une puissance Mahométane et Hindoue aussi bien qu’une puissance Chrétienne, et si l’Inde fait partie de l’Empire comme assoc
U||iée, le sentiment Musulman demande à être apaisé autant que les autres. Il semblerait donc que l’action la plus correcte de la part de Son Excellence le Vice-roi serait de remettre les cérémonies en l’honneur de la paix jusqu’à ce que la question du Califat fût résolue d’une façon satisfaisante.
U||L’honneur de l’Angleterre est en jeu.—Cette question affecte en effet l’honneur de l’Angleterre,—la parole donnée par le Premier Ministre. Que sont les richesses, le pouvoir et la gloire militaire, si cet honneur est souillé? Aussi ai-je été peiné de lire le résumé télégraphique du discours du Premier Ministre; il paraissait blesser gratuitement la susceptibilité musulmane et laisser entrevoir une solution de la question du Califat absolument opposée à la parole solennelle qu’il avait donnée après délibération, à une époque où cette parole avait raffermi la fidélité des Musulmans et sans nul doute stimulé l’enrôlement des plus guerriers parmi eux. Je veux espérer encore que des conseils plus sages l’emporteront et que justice sera rendue à la cause Mahométane. Si toutefois le pire devait arriver, le Comité pour le Califat à décidé hier soir de conseiller aux Mahométans de retirer leur coopération au Gouvernement. J’eus 16 l’avantage d’être présent au 
U||Comité et aux réunions générales, et je me permets d’avertir le Gouvernement de la solennité de la circonstance et de la gravité de la décision prise. Je sais que retirer sa coopération au gouvernement est une chose très grave. Elle demande que l’on soit capable de supporter la souffrance. Je sais également que tout citoyen a le droit de retirer sa coopération à l’Etat, lorsque par cette coopération il s’avilit. C’est une manière tangible de témoigner son mécontentement.
U||Le boycottage.—On peut donc espérer que le Gouvernement impérial reconnaîtra la gravité de la situation. Mais de la Non-Coopération passer au boycottage, c’est descendre du sublime au ridicule. Le Comité décida hier, à une forte majorité, le boycottage des marchandises anglaises si la question du Califat n’était pas réglée d’une façon satisfaisante. Le boycottage est une forme de vengeance, et pour arriver à une solution équitable, il nous faut préparer l’opinion du monde. Je me permets de suggérer à mes amis Mahométans qu’ils n’auront pas l’opinion du monde pour eux, s’ils boycottent les marchandises anglaises pour en accepter d’autres. De plus, le boycottage que l’on propose est un aveu de faiblesse; et pour pouvoir traiter toutes les questions, il nous faut montrer notre force et non notre faiblesse. J’espère donc que le Comité pour le Califat, après avoir sérieusement réfléchi, reviendra sur sa décision et annulera sa résolution de boycottage. Pour trait
U||er cette importante question, il faut avoir du calme, de la patience et ne pas s’écarter des faits. Il ne suffit pas qu’il n’y ait point de violence. En vérité, un discours violent peut faire autant de mal 17 qu’un acte violent, et je suis persuadé que vous ne voudriez pas qu’une parole ou une action trop vive fît du tort à une cause aussi sacrée.
U||Les Griefs du Pendjab.—Il me reste à examiner une attitude que m’ont suggérée quelques amis. On a prétendu que les Griefs du Pendjab étaient aussi une raison sérieuse pour ne point participer aux cérémonies en honneur de la paix. Je me permets de différer d’opinion. Quelque pénible que soit le mal fait au Pendjab c’est en somme une affaire privée, et parler des griefs du Pendjab pour justifier notre refus de collaborer aux célébrations Impériales montrerait que nous manquons du sens des proportions. Les griefs du Pendjab ne proviennent pas, comme la question du Califat, des clauses de la paix. Si nous voulons donner à la question du Califat sa véritable place et lui conserver toute son importance, il faut que nous l’isolions. A mon humble avis, nous ne pouvons nous dispenser de prendre part aux cérémonies que pour des raisons qui proviennent directement de la paix et touchent aux parties vitales de notre existence nationale. La question du Califat répond seule à ces deux conditi
U||ons.

U||LA PROCLAMATION ROYALE
U||La Proclamation[53] publiée par le Souverain le 24 de ce mois est un document dont le peuple britannique 19 a toutes les raisons de se montrer fier et dont chaque Indien devrait être satisfait. Venant à la suite des révélations faites devant la Commission de Lord Hunter, la Proclamation laisse apparaître le véritable caractère anglais. Car de même que la Proclamation nous en montre le meilleur côté, les cruautés du général Dyer nous en dévoilent le plus mauvais[54]. La Proclamation témoigne du désir d’agir avec équité, les actes du général Dyer montrent l’homme, sous l’influence de la peur et de l’emportement, devenu démon. La juxtaposition des deux événements est, je crois, purement accidentelle. La Proclamation était l’aboutissement inévitable de la mesure importante qui avait reçu le consentement royal. Elle y a mis la dernière touche. La loi sur les Réformes, jointe à la Proclamation, est le gage des intentions équitables du peuple britannique, et en conséquence 
U||elle devrait éloigner tout soupçon. Mais ceci ne veut pas dire que nous restions les bras croisés, et que nous nous attendions à obtenir tout ce que nous voulons. Sous le régime constitutionnel britannique, rien ne s’obtient sans lutte sérieuse. Personne n’a cru une seconde ce qui a été dit au Parlement: que les Réformes n’avaient pas été accordées à cause de l’agitation. Nous n’aurions point avancé d’un pas, s’il n’y avait eu un Congrès pour réclamer les droits du peuple. Faire de l’agitation n’est autre chose qu’un mouvement vers un but déterminé. Mais de même que tout mouvement ne signifie point progrès, toute agitation ne signifie pas succès. 20 Une agitation indisciplinée,—ce qui n’est qu’une paraphrase de violence en parole et en action—ne peut que retarder le progrès national, et amener un châtiment immérité, tel que le massacre de Jallianwalla Bagh. D’une agitation disciplinée dépend le progrès national. La méthode la plus convenable consi
U||ste donc à agir raisonnablement, et nous sommes persuadés que la Proclamation Royale et les Réformes ne veulent pas dire qu’il y aura moins d’agitation et moins de travail, mais au contraire plus de travail et plus d’agitation de la bonne sorte.
U||Les Réformes sont assurément incomplètes: elles ne nous accordent pas assez. Nous avions droit à davantage et pouvions en assumer la responsabilité; mais telles qu’elles sont, il ne nous est pas permis de les dédaigner. Elles nous permettront de nous développer. Notre devoir, par conséquent, n’est pas de chercher à les dénigrer, mais de nous mettre tranquillement à l’œuvre pour les faire aboutir à un succès, nous préparant ainsi par anticipation à l’époque où nous aurons une responsabilité entière. Notre travail actuel consiste à tourner notre effort sur nous-mêmes. Concentrons nos énergies pour nous débarrasser des abus sociaux, créer un suffrage puissant et envoyer dans nos conseils des hommes qui posent leur candidature pour rendre des services à la Nation et non pour se faire une réclame personnelle.
U||Il y a beaucoup de méfiance réciproque entre les Anglais et nous. Le Général Dyer, oubliant sa dignité d’homme, devint lâche parce que la méfiance et par conséquent la peur s’emparèrent de lui. Il craignait d’être assailli. La Proclamation, plus que les Réformes, remplace la méfiance par la confiance. Il reste 21 à voir si cette confiance va pénétrer parmi les fonctionnaires. Supposons-le et faisons-lui le meilleur accueil possible. En agissant ainsi, nous ne saurions avoir tort. Avoir confiance est une vertu. La faiblesse engendre la méfiance. Le meilleur moyen de témoigner notre satisfaction est assurément de travailler de bon cœur et de bonne grâce. Notre travail sincère sera la plus sûre garantie de notre progrès rapide vers le but désiré.
U||Pendant toutes ces années, la seule personnalité qui ait travaillé pour l’Inde sans se laisser distraire un seul instant, est M. Montague. Nous avons eu plusieurs secrétaires d’Etat qui ont illustré leur poste, mais aucun dont la présence y ait jeté autant d’éclat. Il a été un véritable ami de l’Inde, il a mérité notre reconnaissance. Quant à Lord Sinha il a ajouté à la renommée de son pays. Les Indiens ne sauraient être trop fiers de lui.
U||31 Décembre 1919
U||LE SWARAJ PAR LE SWADESHI[55]
U||La véritable réforme nécessaire à l’Inde est l’adoption du Swadeshi au sens exact du mot. Le problème 22 immédiat que nous avons à résoudre n’est pas de savoir comment organiser le Gouvernement du pays, mais comment nous vêtir et nous nourrir. En 1918, nous avons envoyé hors de l’Inde 600 millions de roupies pour acheter des tissus. En continuant d’acheter à l’étranger à ce taux, nous privons d’autant les Indiens qui tissent et qui filent sans leur mettre entre les mains un autre métier. Rien de surprenant si la dixième partie de notre population est condamnée à mourir de faim, et si le reste est en majorité insuffisamment nourrie. Qui sait regarder peut se rendre compte par lui-même que la classe moyenne est déjà sous-nourrie et que nos petits n’ont pas assez de lait. Le projet des réformes, quelque libéral qu’il soit, n’aidera pas à résoudre le problème avant un certain temps. Le Swadeshi le résoudra immédiatement.
U||Le Pendjab m’en a rendu la solution encore plus claire. Dieu merci, les belles femmes du Pendjab n’ont rien perdu de la souplesse de leurs doigts. Nobles ou humbles, toutes savent filer. Elles n’ont pas brûlé leur rouet, ainsi que l’ont fait les femmes du Gujerate. J’éprouve une joie véritable, lorsqu’elles me lancent leurs balles de fil sur les genoux. Elles disent qu’elles ont le temps de filer et que le Khaddar[56] tissé à la main avec leur fil est bien supérieur à celui que l’on fabrique avec du fil filé à la machine. Nos ancêtres parvenaient à se vêtir avec confort, sans difficulté et sans l’obligation d’acheter leurs tissus sur les marchés étrangers.
U||Cet art merveilleux et si simple pourtant risque de 23 disparaître si nous ne nous réveillons pas à temps. Le Pendjab nous montre ce qu’il peut faire. Mais au Pendjab aussi il disparaît rapidement. Chaque année voit diminuer la quantité de fil préparé à la main, ce qui signifie une pauvreté plus grande et plus d’oisiveté. Les femmes qui n’emploient plus leur temps à filer le passent à bavarder et ne font pas autre chose.
U||Pour obvier au mal, il est indispensable que tout Indien instruit et se rendant compte de son devoir élémentaire, offre immédiatement un rouet aux femmes de son entourage et leur procure le moyen d’apprendre à filer. Des millions de mètres de fil peuvent ainsi être filés chaque jour. Tout Indien cultivé prêt à porter le tissu fabriqué avec ce fil, aidera à faire renaître la seule industrie villageoise de l’Inde.
U||Sans industrie villageoise, le paysan indien est perdu. Il ne peut vivre du produit de la terre. Il a besoin d’une industrie complémentaire. La plus facile, la plus économique et la meilleure est celle du rouet.
U||Je sais que c’est demander une révolution dans notre conception mentale. Et parce que c’est une révolution, je prétends que le Swadeshi mène au Swarâj. Une nation qui peut économiser 600 millions de roupies chaque année et distribuer cette somme énorme parmi les fileurs et les tisserands, travaillant chez eux, aura acquis une puissance d’organisation et d’industrie qui doit la rendre capable de faire tout le nécessaire pour son développement.
U||Le réformateur porté à la rêverie murmure: «Attendez que j’aie un gouvernement responsable, et je protégerai l’industrie dans l’Inde, sans que les femmes 24 aient à filer ou le tisserand à tisser.» Ceci a été dit textuellement par des gens qui réfléchissent. Je me permets de suggérer qu’il se cache une double illusion derrière une pareille proposition. L’Inde ne peut pas attendre un régime protectionniste, et ce protectionnisme ne fera pas baisser le prix des vêtements. Secondement, ce protectionnisme sera inutile aux milliers d’êtres qui meurent de faim. On ne peut leur venir en aide qu’en leur procurant le moyen d’ajouter à leurs gains, en leur rendant leur industrie qui est de filer. Par conséquent, que nous ayons ou non un système protectionniste, il nous faudra toujours faire revivre le filage à la main et encourager le tissage.
U||Lorsque la guerre faisait rage, tous les bras disponibles d’Amérique et d’Angleterre furent employés à construire des navires et il s’en construisit avec une rapidité surprenante. Si j’en avais le pouvoir, je ferais apprendre à tout Indien à tisser et à filer, et je l’obligerais à y consacrer chaque jour un certain temps. Je commencerais par les écoles qui sont des unités organisées toutes prêtes. Multiplier les filatures ne peut résoudre le problème. Il leur faudrait trop de temps pour remédier à l’épuisement, et elles ne pourraient pas distribuer les 600 millions de roupies à nos familles. Elles ne feraient que concentrer le labeur et l’argent et ajouteraient à la confusion.

U||L’UNION HINDOUE-MUSULMANE
U||Monsieur Candler, journaliste anglais, m’a demandé il y a quelque temps, dans une interview imaginaire, si l’expression de mes sentiments hindous-musulmans étant sincère, je mangerais et boirais en compagnie d’un Mahométan et accepterais de donner à un Mahométan ma fille en mariage. Cette question m’a été posée à nouveau sous une autre forme par des amis. Est-il nécessaire pour l’Union Hindoue-Musulmane que ses membres prennent leur repas en commun et qu’ils se marient entre eux? Ceux qui m’ont posé cette question ajoutent que si ces deux points sont essentiels, une véritable union ne saurait exister: car des milliers de Sanatanis[57] ne pourraient se résoudre aux repas en commun et encore moins à des mariages mixtes.
U||Je suis de ceux qui ne voient pas dans les castes une institution nuisible. A l’origine, c’était une coutume saine, tendant au bien de la nation. Pour moi, l’idée qu’il soit nécessaire au progrès national de se réunir pour manger et boire, ou de s’allier par des mariages, me semble une superstition empruntée à l’Occident. Manger est une opération vitale, tout autant que la plupart des autres nécessités physiologiques 26 de l’existence; et si l’homme n’avait, en grande partie pour son mal, fait de l’action de manger un plaisir et un fétiche, nous remplirions cette fonction en secret, ainsi que nous le faisons de toutes les autres. En vérité, la plus haute culture de l’Hindouisme considère encore ainsi l’acte de manger, et il existe des milliers d’Hindous qui ne mangeraient devant personne. Je pourrais citer bien des noms d’hommes et de femmes cultivés prenant leurs repas dans la solitude la plus complète, et qui vivent en bonne intelligence avec tous.
U||La question de mariage est plus délicate encore. S’il est possible à des frères et sœurs de vivre en affectueuse amitié sans songer à s’épouser, je ne vois rien qui s’oppose à ce que ma fille considère tout Mahométan comme un frère, et réciproquement. J’ai sur la religion et le mariage des opinions très nettes. C’est en réprimant nos appétits,—qu’ils se rapportent à la nourriture ou au mariage,—que, du point de vue religieux, nous avançons le plus. Je désespérerais de jamais pouvoir cultiver de relations amicales avec le monde, s’il me fallait reconnaître le droit à tout jeune homme d’offrir sa main en mariage à ma fille, ou me considérer comme tenu de dîner avec n’importe qui. J’ai la prétention de vivre en bons termes avec le monde entier, je ne me suis jamais querellé avec un seul Mahométan ou un seul Chrétien et, depuis des années, je n’ai jamais touché à autre chose qu’à des fruits, soit chez des Mahométans soit chez des Chrétiens. Je refuser
U||ais certes énergiquement de manger des mets préparés dans l’assiette de mon propre fils ou de boire de l’eau d’une tasse où il eût mis les lèvres sans qu’elle 27 eût été lavée; mais cette réserve et cet exclusivisme n’ont jamais affecté mon étroite intimité avec mes amis Mahométans et Chrétiens, ni avec mes fils.
U||Dîner en commun et s’épouser n’a jamais empêché les désunions, les querelles, ou pire. Les Pandavas et les Kauravas qui dînaient ensemble et s’alliaient par mariage se prenaient à la gorge sans le moindre remords. La haine entre Allemands et Anglais n’est pas encore éteinte.
U||A dire vrai, les alliances et les dîners, ne sont pas nécessairement des facteurs d’amitié et d’union, s’ils en sont souvent l’emblème. Insister sur l’un et sur l’autre peut facilement devenir et est actuellement un obstacle à l’Union Hindoue-Musulmane. Si nous nous imaginons que les Hindous et les Musulmans ne peuvent être unis sans dîner ensemble et se marier entre eux, nous allons élever une barrière artificielle entre eux qu’il sera bien difficile de détruire. D’autre part l’union grandissante entre Hindous et Musulmans va se trouver sérieusement entravée, si les jeunes Mahométans, par exemple, en arrivent à croire qu’ils peuvent légalement faire la cour aux jeunes filles Hindoues. Les parents hindous, s’ils en ont le soupçon, ne voudront plus admettre les Mahométans dans leur intérieur, comme ils ont commencé à le faire. A mon avis, il faut que les jeunes Mahométans et Hindous tiennent compte de cette restriction.
U||Je considère qu’il est absolument impossible que des mariages aient lieu entre Hindous et Mahométans et que chacun demeure fidèle à sa religion. La véritable beauté de l’Union Hindoue-Musulmane consiste justement dans ce fait que chacun des deux 28 reste fidèle à sa religion, tout en respectant celle de l’autre. Car nous pensons aux Hindous et aux Mahométans du type le plus orthodoxe, capables de se considérer comme des ennemis naturels, ainsi qu’ils l’ont fait jusqu’à présent.
U||En quoi consiste donc l’Union Hindoue-Musulmane, et comment peut-on l’encourager? La réponse est simple. L’Union consiste à avoir un but commun, un espoir commun et des souffrances communes. Afin de l’encourager, il nous faut coopérer pour ce même but, partager nos souffrances et exercer une tolérance mutuelle. Notre but commun est que notre grand pays devienne plus grand encore et qu’il se gouverne lui-même. Nous ne manquons pas de tristesses à partager. Et aujourd’hui que les Mahométans sont profondément touchés par la question du Califat et que leur cause est juste, rien ne saurait mieux gagner leur amitié que si les Hindous soutiennent de tout cœur leurs revendications. Boire et manger ensemble les unira bien moins que de s’aider dans la question du Califat.
U||En tout temps et pour toutes les races, une grande tolérance est nécessaire. Nous ne pouvons vivre en paix si les Hindous se refusent à permettre aux Mahométans les formes extérieures de leur religion, leurs manières et leurs coutumes, ou si les Mahométans supportent mal l’idolâtrie Hindoue et son culte de la vache. Il n’est pas nécessaire que j’approuve ce que je tolère. Je déteste sincèrement boire, manger de la viande et fumer; mais je tolère ces choses chez les Hindous, les Mahométans et les Chrétiens, de même que je m’attends à ce qu’ils tolèrent mon abstinence, même si elle leur est désagréable. Toutes les querelles 29 entre Hindous et Mahométans proviennent de ce que chacun veut contraindre l’autre à adopter son opinion.
U||29 Février 1920.
U||LES APPELS D’AMRITSAR[58]
U||Ces appels ont été rejetés malgré la plaidoirie du meilleur avocat. Le Conseil Privé a confirmé une procédure illégale. Je dois avouer que le jugement ne m’a pas autrement surpris, quoique les réflexions du jury pendant la plaidoirie de Sir John Simon laissassent espérer un verdict favorable. Les jugements prononcés par les plus Hautes Cours, si j’en juge par l’étude des procès politiques, se laissent volontiers influencer par de subtiles considérations politiques. Les précautions les plus compliquées pour arriver à se maintenir dans un esprit purement juridique disparaissent forcément, aux moments critiques. Le Conseil Privé ne saurait être exempt des limitations 30 inhérentes à toutes les institutions humaines qui ne valent que pour des conditions normales. Une décision favorable pour le peuple aurait eu comme conséquence d’exposer le Gouvernement Indien à une extrême déconsidération, dont il lui eût été très difficile de se relever, de toute une génération.
U||On peut juger de la signification politique de l’événement par ce fait qu’aussitôt la nouvelle parvenue à Lahore, tous les préparatifs commencés pour la réception de Lala Lajpatrai furent décommandés et que le bruit courut que la capitale du Pendjab était en grand deuil. Un discrédit plus profond frappe donc le Gouvernement par suite de ce jugement, car à tort ou à raison l’opinion populaire considérera que, sous la Constitution Britannique, il n’existe pas de justice lorsque d’importantes considérations politiques ou de race entrent en jeu.
U||Il n’y a qu’une seule manière d’éviter la catastrophe. L’esprit humain et en particulier l’esprit indien est sensible à la générosité. J’espère que le Gouvernement du Pendjab ou le Gouvernement Central annulera immédiatement, sans qu’une agitation ou des pétitions soient nécessaires, les condamnations à mort et, s’il y a la moindre possibilité, rendra en même temps la liberté à tous ceux qui ont fait appel.
U||D’abord et ainsi que je l’ai déjà dit, deux considérations d’égale importance le demandent: premièrement, gagner à nouveau la confiance du public, secondement, obéir textuellement à la Proclamation Royale. Cet important document politique ordonne la mise en liberté de tous les délinquants politiques quand elle ne saurait être un danger pour la société. Personne ne peut dire que les vingt-et-un condamnés 31 qui ont fait appel seraient d’une façon quelconque un danger pour la société s’ils recouvraient leur liberté. Jamais ces hommes n’avaient commis de crimes auparavant; la plupart d’entre eux étaient considérés comme des citoyens paisibles et respectables. On ne leur connaissait point d’attaches avec des sociétés révolutionnaires. S’ils ont commis un crime quelconque, ce fut sous l’impulsion du moment et devant ce qui leur paraissait une grave provocation. D’autre part, le public est persuadé que la majorité des condamnations des tribunaux militaires ne s’app
U||uyaient sur aucune preuve satisfaisante. Aussi, j’espère que le Gouvernement qui a bien agi en rendant la liberté aux délinquants politiques, même lorsque ces derniers avaient été pris sur le fait, n’hésitera pas à rendre la liberté à ceux qui ont fait appel, et méritera ainsi le bon-vouloir de l’Inde entière. L’acte généreux accompli à l’heure du triomphe est celui qui a le plus de valeur. Et pour le peuple, ce refus de tenir compte de l’appel des condamnés a été considéré comme un triomphe du Gouvernement.
U||Je demanderai donc respectueusement aux amis du Pendjab de ne point perdre courage. Il faut nous préparer avec calme au pire. Si les condamnations sont justes, si ceux qui ont été condamnés se sont rendus coupables de meurtre, ou d’incitation au meurtre, pourquoi échapperaient-ils au châtiment? S’ils n’ont point commis les crimes qu’on leur reproche, ce qui est le cas pour la plupart d’entre eux, nous en sommes persuadés, pourquoi échapperions-nous au sort de tous ceux qui veulent s’élever plus haut? Si nous avons voulu nous élever, pourquoi 32 craindrions-nous le sacrifice? Aucune nation ne s’est jamais élevée sans faire de sacrifices, et l’on ne saurait parler de sacrifice que s’il y a innocence, et non crime.
U||3 mars 1920.
U||LA NON-VIOLENCE
U||Lorsqu’un homme prétend être non-violent, il ne doit point s’irriter contre qui l’a outragé. Il ne lui souhaitera aucun mal; il lui souhaitera du bien; il ne le maudira pas; il ne lui causera aucune souffrance physique. Il acceptera tous les outrages que lui fera subir l’offenseur. La Non-Violence comprise ainsi devient l’innocence absolue. La Non-Violence absolue est une absence totale de mauvais-vouloir contre tout ce qui vit. Elle s’étend même aux êtres inférieurs à l’espèce humaine sans en excepter les insectes et les bêtes nuisibles. Elles n’ont pas été créées pour satisfaire à nos penchants destructeurs. Si la pensée intime du Créateur nous était connue, nous découvririons la place qui leur appartient dans sa création. La Non-Violence, sous sa forme active, consiste par conséquent en une bienveillance envers tout ce qui existe. C’est l’Amour pur. Je l’ai lu dans 33 l’Ecriture sainte hindoue, dans la Bible, et dans le Koran.
U||La Non-Violence est un état parfait. C’est un but vers lequel tend, bien qu’à son insu, l’humanité tout entière. L’homme ne devient pas divin lorsque, dans sa personne, il incarne l’innocence; c’est alors seulement qu’il devient véritablement homme. Tels que nous sommes actuellement, mi-hommes, mi-bêtes, nous avons la prétention, dans notre arrogante ignorance, de remplir le rôle dévolu à notre espèce, lorsque nous rendons coup pour coup et que nous nous abandonnons à la colère. Nous feignons de croire que la loi du talion est la loi de notre être, alors que dans toute Écriture Sainte nous voyons que la loi du talion n’est nulle part obligatoire, mais seulement tolérée. L’empire sur soi est seul obligatoire. La vengeance est une satisfaction qui nécessite des règles compliquées. La maîtrise de soi est la loi de notre être. La plus haute perfection demande la plus haute maîtrise. La souffrance devient ainsi le symbole de l’espèce humaine.
U||Le but s’éloigne sans cesse de nous. Plus nos progrès sont grands, plus nous prenons conscience de notre indignité. La satisfaction se trouve dans l’effort accompli, non dans le but atteint. Dans l’effort absolu se trouve la victoire absolue.
U||Aussi, et tout en me rendant compte plus que jamais de la distance du but, pour moi la loi d’Amour est la loi de mon être[59]. Chaque fois que 34 j’échouerai, et justement à cause de cet échec, mon effort n’en sera que plus résolu.
U||Mais je ne prêche pas cette loi finale par l’intermédiaire du Congrès ou de l’Organisation pour le Califat. Je sais trop bien ce qui me manque. Je sais qu’une tentative de ce genre est condamnée d’avance à un échec. S’attendre à ce qu’une masse d’hommes et de femmes obéissent spontanément à cette loi, c’est ignorer comment ils vivent. Mais de l’estrade du Congrès et aux réunions de la Société pour le Califat, je prêche ce qui ressort de cette loi. Ce que le Congrès a admis, ainsi que les assemblées pour le Califat, n’est qu’une parcelle de ce que la loi implique. Avec des travailleurs sincères pour la Cause, il serait possible d’en faire appliquer par de grandes masses 35 une partie restreinte en peu de temps. Mais pour arriver au but, il faut que la plus faible partie réponde aux mêmes conditions que le tout. Une goutte d’eau doit à l’analyse donner le même résultat qu’un lac entier. La nature de ma Non-Violence vis-à-vis de mon frère ne saurait être d
U||ifférente de celle de ma Non-Violence vis-à-vis de l’univers. Lorsque j’étends à l’univers entier l’amour que j’ai pour mon frère, il faut que cet amour ait la même composition.
U||Une manière d’agir particulière est une politique, lorsque son application en est limitée au temps ou à l’espace. La plus haute politique est par conséquent de l’appliquer le plus complètement possible. Mais tant qu’elle dure, l’honnêteté comme politique ne diffère en rien de l’honnêteté par croyance. La différence 36 qui existe entre les deux, c’est que le marchand qui croit à la politique de l’honnêteté ne s’embarrassera plus de son honnêteté lorsqu’elle ne rapportera rien, alors que celui pour qui c’est une conviction continuera d’être honnête, même s’il doit tout perdre.
U||La Non-Violence politique du Non-Coopérateur ne résiste pas à cette épreuve, dans la majorité des cas. Et c’est ce qui prolonge la lutte. Que nul ne blâme le caractère inflexible de la nature anglaise! La fibre la plus dure est tenue de se dissoudre au feu de l’amour. On ne pourrait me forcer à changer d’attitude à ce sujet, parce que je sais cela. Quand la nature britannique ou toute autre résiste, c’est que le feu, s’il existe, n’est pas suffisant.
U||Il n’est pas nécessaire que notre Non-Violence soit forte, mais il faut qu’elle soit sincère. Nous ne devons pas souhaiter du mal aux Anglais ni à nos compatriotes qui coopèrent, tant que nous faisons profession d’être non-violents. Mais le plus grand nombre parmi nous a voulu le mal; s’il ne l’a point fait, c’est uniquement par faiblesse ou parce qu’il a cru à tort qu’en s’abstenant de faire le mal physiquement il tenait son serment. Notre vœu de Non-Violence exclut toute possibilité de représailles futures. Quelques-uns parmi nous semblent malheureusement s’être contentés de retarder la date de la vengeance.
U||Qu’on ne se méprenne pas sur mes paroles: je ne dis pas que la politique de Non-Violence exclue la possibilité de vengeance, lorsque cette politique sera abandonnée. Mais elle exclut absolument la possibilité d’une vengeance future, si la lutte se termine par un succès. Aussi sommes-nous tenus, 37 pendant que nous poursuivons notre politique de Non-Violence, d’être en bons termes avec les administrateurs anglais et leurs coopérateurs. J’ai été rempli de honte, lorsqu’on m’a dit que, dans certaines parties de l’Inde, des Anglais et des coopérateurs bien connus ne pouvaient circuler sans danger. Les scènes honteuses qui se sont produites récemment à une réunion de Madras étaient un reniement absolu de la Non-Violence. Ceux qui ont forcé le président à se retirer par leurs hurlements, parce que celui-ci m’avait insulté, paraît-il, se sont déshonorés et ont déshonoré leur politique. Ils ont blessé au cœur leur ami et leur allié Mr. Andrews. Ils ont fait du tort à leur 
U||propre cause. Si le président était persuadé que j’étais un gredin, il avait parfaitement le droit de le dire. Agir par ignorance n’est pas provoquer. Mais un Non-Coopérateur, par sa parole donnée, est tenu de ne pas répondre à la provocation même la plus grave. Le jour où j’agirai comme un gredin, il y aura grave provocation, et j’avoue qu’elle sera suffisante pour délier de son vœu de Non-Violence tout Non-Coopérateur et justifier tout Non-Coopérateur qui voudrait me tuer pour l’avoir induit en erreur.
U||Vouloir cultiver la Non-Violence, même d’une façon aussi restreinte, est peut-être impossible. Peut-être ne faut-il pas nous attendre à ce que les gens ne désirent pas le mal de leur adversaire, tout en ne leur en faisant pas. Pour être de bonne foi, nous devrions alors cesser de nous servir de l’expression Non-Violence pour caractériser notre lutte. L’alternative ne serait pas de recourir immédiatement à la violence. Mais le peuple ne serait pas tenu de se soumettre à une discipline de Non-Violence, et je ne 38 serais pas dans l’obligation d’endosser la responsabilité de Chauri-Chaura[60]. L’école de Non-Violence restreinte continuera alors à prospérer obscurément, mais sans le fardeau terrible de responsabilité qu’elle porte aujourd’hui.
U||Pourtant, si la Non-Violence doit demeurer la politique de la nation, nous sommes tenus, pour sa réputation et celle de l’humanité, de la pratiquer à la lettre et selon l’esprit. Et si nous voulons aller jusqu’au bout de cette politique, si nous croyons en elle, nous devons sans tarder nous réconcilier avec les Anglais et les coopérateurs. Il faut qu’ils nous certifient qu’ils se sentent en complète sécurité parmi nous, qu’ils nous considèrent comme des amis, bien que nous appartenions à une école de pensée et à une politique radicalement opposées. Il nous faut les accueillir sur nos estrades, comme des invités de marque, et les rencontrer sur des estrades neutres comme des camarades. Il nous faut élaborer une ligne de conduite pour les rencontres de ce genre. Il ne faut pas que notre Non-Violence donne naissance à la violence, à la haine et au mauvais vouloir. Nous serons jugés selon nos œuvres, comme le reste des mortels. Un programme de Non-Violence pour obtenir le Swarâj 
U||demande, bien entendu, une certaine habileté pour organiser les affaires sur une base non-violente et nécessite que l’on inculque l’esprit d’obéissance. M. Churchill, lequel ne comprend que l’évangile de la force, a parfaitement raison lorsqu’il 39 dit que le problème irlandais diffère du problème indien. Il entend par là que l’Irlande, ayant obtenu son Swarâj par la violence, saura le conserver par la violence, s’il le faut. D’autre part, si l’Inde obtient effectivement le Swarâj par la Non-Violence il faut qu’elle soit à même de le conserver par des moyens non-violents. A ceci M. Churchill ne croit guère, à moins que l’Inde ne donne une preuve de ce dont elle est capable, par une démonstration visible du principe. Cette démonstration est impossible, tant que la société ne se sera pas imprégnée de l’esprit de Non-Violence, de telle façon que le peuple, dans sa vie politique se conforme à la Non-Violence, ou en d’autres termes que l’autorité civile l’empor
U||te sur l’autorité militaire.
U||Par conséquent, le Home Rule que nous obtiendrons par des moyens non-violents ne saurait jamais entraîner un intervalle de chaos et d’anarchie. Le Swarâj par la Non-Violence doit être une révolution paisible et progressive, de telle sorte que le transfert des pouvoirs, d’une corporation fermée aux représentants du peuple, s’accomplirait naturellement comme un fruit mûr tombant d’un arbre bien soigné. Je répète qu’il se peut fort bien que la réalisation soit impossible. Mais je sais que la Non-Violence n’implique pas moins. Si nos aides actuels ne croient pas qu’il soit possible d’arriver à une atmosphère relativement non-violente, ils devraient abandonner complètement le programme de Non-Violence et en préparer un autre absolument différent. Si nous nous approchons de notre programme avec la restriction mentale qu’après tout, nous arracherons le pouvoir aux Anglais par la force des armes, nous 40 manquons à notre profession de Non-Violence. Si nous avons foi en notre prog
U||ramme, nous sommes tenus de croire que les Anglais ne seront pas insensibles à la force de l’affection, puisqu’ils sont certainement sensibles à la force des armes. Pour les incrédules, le choix est entre les Conseils qui sont, avec leurs lourds programmes d’humiliations couvrant plusieurs générations, l’école de l’expérience, ou bien une révolution sanglante comme on n’en a jamais vu dans le monde entier. Je n’ai pas le moindre désir de jouer un rôle dans une telle révolution, et je ne veux pas être un instrument consentant à la faire naître. Selon moi, il faut choisir entre la Non-Violence sincère, avec la Non-Coopération comme conséquence directe, ou le retour à une coopération antagonique, c’est-à-dire à la coopération avec obstruction.
U||9 mars 1920
U||LE 6 AVRIL ET LE 13
U||Il nous est impossible d’oublier le 6 Avril, qui donna des forces vitales à l’Inde tout entière, et le 13 qui fit du Pendjab un lieu de pèlerinage. Le 6 avril vit l’aube du Satyâgraha. On peut différer d’opinion au sujet de la Désobéissance Civile, mais 41 nul ne pourrait nier sa doctrine de Vérité et d’Amour, c’est-à-dire de non-cruauté. Avec Satyâ et Ahimsâ[61] réunis, on peut amener le monde entier à ses pieds. Le Satyâgraha n’est pas autre chose dans son essence que l’introduction de la Vérité et de la Douceur dans la vie politique, c’est-à-dire nationale. Et que l’on se lie ou non au Satyâgraha par serment, il n’y a pas de doute que l’esprit de Satyâgraha se soit répandu parmi les masses. Telle fut en tous cas mon expérience personnelle, parmi les milliers de Pendjabis que j’ai rencontrés dans ma tournée au Pendjab.
U||Le 6 Avril inaugura également un plan défini d’Union Hindoue-Musulmane et de Swadeshi. Ce fut le 6 Avril qui dévoila le sens caché de la loi Rowlatt et en fit lettre morte. Le 13 Avril, eut lieu non seulement la terrible tragédie, mais dans cette tragédie le sang hindou-musulman répandu à flots se mêla en un seul ruisseau et scella l’entente.
U||Que faut-il faire pour commémorer et célébrer ces événements nationaux? Je me permets de proposer que ceux qui le désireraient consacrent la journée du 6 Avril prochain au jeûne (vingt-quatre heures d’abstinence totale) et à la prière, et qu’à sept heures du soir dans l’Inde entière se tiennent des réunions demandant l’abolition de la loi Rowlatt et exprimant la conviction nationale que toute paix dans l’Inde est impossible tant que cette loi subsistera. Que la loi soit devenue lettre morte est tout à fait insuffisant. Cette loi est ou n’est pas une honte. Si cette loi est une honte, il faut qu’elle soit abolie. En l’abolissant avant l’application des Réformes, le Gouvernement 42 montrerait sa bonne volonté. La semaine qui suivrait le six devrait être consacrée entièrement à quelque œuvre se rapportant à la tragédie du treize. Je proposerais donc que cette semaine fût consacrée à réunir des souscriptions pour le monument commémoratif du Jallianwala Bagh, en se so
U||uvenant que la somme nécessaire est de un million de roupies. Chaque ville pourrait organiser la quête à sa guise, ainsi que chaque village, en prenant toutes les précautions contre la fraude et les détournements, et la terminerait, le soir du 12 Avril.
U||Parlons maintenant du 13. Ce jour-là entre tous devrait être consacré au jeûne et à la prière. Il ne devrait y avoir ni animosité ni colère. Nous voulons chérir la mémoire de morts innocents, nous ne voulons pas nous souvenir du crime qui a été commis. C’est en se montrant prête au sacrifice que la nation s’élèvera, et non en se préparant à se venger. Je voudrais aussi qu’en ce jour la nation se souvînt des excès commis par la masse et qu’elle s’en repentît. La semaine se terminerait par des réunions où l’Inde entière s’engagerait à réclamer au Gouvernement Indien et au Gouvernement Impérial les mesures nécessaires pour qu’une tragédie semblable ne pût se renouveler.
U||Je voudrais demander en outre avec insistance que pendant cette semaine chacun fît tous les efforts possibles pour arriver à comprendre plus parfaitement les principes du Satyâgraha, l’Union Hindoue-Musulmane et le Swadeshi. Et afin de donner encore plus de poids à l’Union Hindoue-Musulmane, je voudrais conseiller le 12 avril à 7 heures du soir que la 43 question du Califat fût résolue conformément aux justes sentiments des Musulmans.
U||Cette semaine nationale serait donc ainsi une semaine de purification, d’examen de conscience, de sacrifice, de discipline parfaite, en même temps que l’expression des sentiments nationaux qui nous sont chers. Il ne devrait subsister nulle trace d’amertume, nulle violence de langage, mais un courage et une fermeté absolus.
U||Ne devrait-il pas y avoir hartal, le six et le treize? Je répondrai catégoriquement: non. Cette semaine est la semaine du Satyâgraha pour ceux qui croient à la Vérité et à la Non-Violence. Le hartal du 6 était un hartal de Satyâgraha en ce sens qu’il était un prélude au Satyâgraha. Le hartal du 6 avril dernier, bien que spontané, ne fut pas dépourvu de pression indue dans la façon dont on persuada au public de ne pas se servir des voitures, etc. Je ne conseillerais donc pas de hartal pendant cette semaine de pénitence et de discipline. D’autre part, il ne faut pas diminuer la valeur des hartal, en les rendant trop fréquents. Il faut les conserver pour les grandes occasions.
U||J’espère respectueusement que tous les partis et toutes les classes trouveront le moyen de prendre part d’une façon complète à l’observance de cette semaine nationale et en feront un événement qui servira au progrès véritable et réel de l’éveil national.

U||RAPPORT NON-OFFICIEL SUR LE PENDJAB
U||Le rapport tant attendu vient de paraître. Les membres de la Commission peuvent se féliciter de la façon méthodique avec laquelle ils ont entrepris leur travail et de la modération dont ils ont fait preuve dans l’accomplissement de leur tâche difficile. La position des membres de la Commission ajoute de l’importance à un rapport qui possède déjà par lui-même une valeur considérable. Les membres de la Commission n’ont rien ajouté aux preuves qu’ils avaient en main; le lecteur peut donc, s’il en a envie, vérifier les conclusions. Les demandes exprimées ne sont ni faibles, ni déraisonnables. Les membres de la Commission réclament hardiment le rappel du Vice-Roi et la destitution de Sir Michael O’Dwyer, du Général Dyer et d’autres officiers. Ces deux dernières demandes sont celles qui pourraient rencontrer quelque opposition, mais les membres de la Commission ont donné, à l’appui, des raisons précises et incontestables. Et si l’exactitude des faits avancés par eux ne peu
U||t être mise en doute, leur demande ne saurait l’être davantage. Ce n’est pas sans chagrin que nous approuvons la demande de rappel du Vice-Roi. Nous sommes persuadés que Son Excellence est 45 un Anglais cultivé, qu’il est animé d’excellentes intentions vis-à-vis de l’Inde et qu’il désire faire ce qui est juste. Mais pour remplir le poste important qu’il occupe, il faut posséder d’autres aptitudes que les siennes. Lord Chelmsford a certainement fait preuve de manque d’imagination. Il applique à ses fonctions dans l’Inde les traditions d’un gouverneur colonial constitutionnel qui doit invariablement se laisser guider par ses ministres et qui agit sur la politique de la colonie (s’il agit quelque peu sur elle), uniquement en exerçant une influence subtile par ses relations sociales. Le Gouverneur des colonies qui se gouvernent elles-mêmes procède par suggestions aimables qu’il n’impose jamais à ses ministres. Il essaye d’agir sur l’opinion publique, non point en exer
U||çant son autorité, mais en se faisant des amis indirects, aux réunions sociales et à demi-politiques. Les qualités mêmes qui faisaient de Lord Chelmsford un Gouverneur parfait le rendent impropre à remplir le poste de Vice-Roi. Le Vice-Roi des Indes a un pouvoir immense. C’est un autocrate à la tête du Conseil Exécutif. Une simple proposition émise par lui a la valeur d’une sanction légale. Il fait et dirige la politique. Il surveille, avec le droit réel d’intervention, l’administration des provinces. Il faut donc qu’il soit un maître ferme, doué d’une grande imagination, de sympathie pour le peuple et qu’il ne craigne pas de la laisser voir. Malgré toutes ses qualités de cœur, Lord Chelmsford s’est montré faible, aux moments critiques. Au lieu de guider ses collègues, il s’est laissé commander par eux. Il a laissé les administrateurs de ses provinces agir à leur guise. Il en est résulté une diversité de politiques: un gouvernement paisible et 46 conciliant à Bomb
U||ay, même lorsqu’il y a provocation; répression au Pendjab, persécution et intolérance même sans provocation. Sous un Gouvernement Central ayant à sa tête un chef qui sait ce qu’il veut et impose sa volonté à ses subordonnés, un tel contraste ne devrait pas être possible. Lord Chelmsford a échoué d’une façon évidente, et nous considérons que les membres de la Commission n’auraient pas accompli leur tâche s’ils avaient hésité, ayant les preuves sous les yeux, à demander le rappel de Son Excellence le Vice-Roi.
U||Quant aux déclarations, les membres de la Commission se sont montrés plutôt trop modérés. Mais peut-être vaudra-t-il mieux que le public les discute seulement, lorsque le rapport officiel du Comité aura paru. Pour ce qui est des déclarations des membres non-officiels de la Commission, nous sommes certains que ces derniers ne pouvaient en faire d’autres. En vérité, en parcourant les témoignages, nous remarquons l’effort soutenu pour éviter toute conclusion ne reposant pas sur une suite de faits accablants.

U||LA CAUSE DES LANGUES INDIGÈNES
U||Il doit paraître évident à quiconque a suivi de près 47 le Sahitaya Sammelans[62] que notre réveil national ne se borne pas uniquement à la politique. L’enthousiasme montré à ces réunions témoigne d’un heureux changement. Nous donnons dans notre pensée aux langues indigènes la place qui leur appartient dans notre existence nationale. La prophétie de Raja Ram Mohan Roy, affirmant que l’Inde deviendrait un pays de langue anglaise, est acceptée aujourd’hui par beaucoup de personnages importants. L’esprit du grand réformateur vit encore en quelques-uns. Un certain nombre de nos hommes éminents généralisent hâtivement et se déclarent en faveur de l’anglais comme langue nationale. La position qu’occupe actuellement l’anglais comme langue des tribunaux a sur leur opinion une importance excessive. Ils ne voient pas que le rang occupé par l’anglais à l’heure présente n’est pas à notre éloge et ne tend pas au développement d’un véritable esprit démocratique. Que des 
U||millions d’hommes apprennent une langue étrangère pour la commodité de quelques centaines de fonctionnaires, c’est le comble de l’absurdité. On cite fréquemment un exemple pris dans notre ancienne histoire et démontrant la nécessité d’une lingua franca pour donner plus de force au Gouvernement Central du pays. Personne ne nie la nécessité d’une langue commune, mais ce ne peut être l’anglais. Il faut que les fonctionnaires reconnaissent les langues indigènes. La seconde raison qui fait appel aux sympathies des anglicistes, c’est la position de l’Inde dans l’Empire Britannique. L’argument, pour dire la chose exactement comme elle est, revient à demander à 48 310 millions d’Indiens d’accepter l’anglais comme langue nationale, dans l’intérêt d’autres parties de l’Inde, dont la population ne dépasse pas 120 millions.
U||Un premier point doit attirer l’attention de quiconque s’intéresse à la question: c’est qu’après un demi siècle de domination britannique, l’anglais n’est pas encore devenu la langue courante de l’Inde. Sans doute, dans nos villes, on parle une sorte de mauvais anglais; ce fait ne peut éblouir que ceux qui prétendent étudier nos problèmes nationaux dans de grandes villes comme Bombay et Calcutta. Et en somme, quelle en est la population? Seulement 2,2 % de la population totale de l’Inde. Le second point dont les partisans de l’anglais ne tiennent pas compte, c’est qu’une forte majorité des langues indigènes se ressemblent; d’où il suit que l’hindoustani comme lingua franca convient à toutes les provinces, à l’exception de la Présidence de Madras. Etant donné cet avantage de l’hindoustani et notre sentiment national actuel, comment pouvons-nous accepter l’anglais comme lingua franca chez nous?
U||La réponse à ce problème décidera du sort des langues indigènes. Notre système d’éducation permet à l’anglais d’avoir une supériorité sur elles qui n’est point naturelle. Les anglicistes extrêmes prétendent que l’anglais doit être employé dès le plus jeune âge dans l’enseignement, fondant cet argument sur le fait que dans un pays étranger les enfants parlent sans difficulté dès le bas âge la langue du pays. La Commission de l’Université de Calcutta réfute cet argument en ces termes: «Alors que dans un pays étranger, l’enfant est entouré d’autres enfants parlant la langue du pays, dans une salle de classe il n’est 49 entouré que de personnes (à l’exception du maître) ignorant comme lui le nouvel idiome. C’est le cas d’un seul, enseignant à plusieurs, non de plusieurs, enseignant à un seul; et ce n’est qu’en faisant des expériences que les méthodes employées en classe peuvent obtenir des résultats satisfaisants.». L’économie nationale réalis
U||e par notre enseignement en langues indigènes a été reconnue par la Commission. Nous avons démontré dans notre numéro du 11 février que nous avons l’approbation de l’Université de Calcutta à ce sujet, ce qui est un nouveau pas franchi. La suite logique devrait être de recommander les langues indigènes à l’Université. La Commission a fixé l’examen de «Matriculation» (examen de fin d’études) comme période de transition entre l’emploi des langues indigènes dans les écoles secondaires et leur emploi dans les collèges universitaires. Les membres de cette Commission ont proposé qu’à l’avenir l’enseignement soit donné en deux langues. Mais ils ont ajouté également: «Nous ne voulons pas préjuger de l’avenir. Ce n’est pas à nous de prédire si le désir naturel d’employer le bengali le plus possible ne finira pas par l’emporter sur les avantages immenses d’une langue commune non seulement à l’Inde entière, mais à plus de peuples que toute autre et qui ouv
U||re la porte à la littérature et aux rapports scientifiques du monde entier.» Si les membres de la Commission n’ont pu établir pour l’avenir, en s’appuyant sur les preuves qui leur furent données, une ligne de conduite en faveur des langues indigènes dans l’éducation universitaire, il est vrai également qu’ils n’ont rien trouvé en faveur de l’anglais ou des deux langues. Ainsi, bien que les réponses à la question 50 des membres de la Commission ne décident rien pour l’avenir, elles révèlent un important mouvement en faveur de l’introduction immédiate du Bengali pour certains buts universitaires et de son introduction prochaine pour d’autres, mouvement que rien ne laissait prévoir, aux débats du Conseil Législatif Impérial de 1915.
U||En étudiant le compte-rendu de l’enquête faite par les Membres de la Commission, nous sommes encore mieux à même d’apprécier leurs remarques. La question posée par eux était: «Considérez-vous que l’anglais devrait être employé comme langue courante dans les cours universitaires, dans l’enseignement et aux examens à tous les degrés au-dessous de la Matriculation?»
U||155 réponses sont en faveur de l’anglais, et près de 138 ne s’opposent pas à la langue maternelle, dans un temps plus ou moins prochain. Cette proportion est assurément encourageante pour les partisans de la langue indigène. En outre, et même parmi ceux qui se déclarent en faveur de l’anglais, le nombre est grand de ceux qui conseillent l’emploi de la langue étrangère à cause de l’insuffisance de livres scolaires dans les divers sujets en langue indigène. Cette école d’éducateurs ne s’y oppose donc pas en principe. Ils n’aiment pas que nous nous jetions à l’eau avant de savoir nager. Dans le même genre, mais plus tranchante est la réponse de ceux qui sont en faveur de l’anglais. Ceux-ci laissent voir qu’ils ignorent l’histoire de nos langues indigènes. Il fut un temps où le sanscrit était la langue de la philosophie hindoue. Quelques savants enthousiastes enrichirent leur langue maternelle d’un fonds respectable de littérature 51 philosophique et mirent la philos
U||ophie hindoue à la portée des masses. Ne pouvons-nous pas avec nos idées modernes faire dans le domaine de la science ce que firent ces savants dans celui de la philosophie? Pour répondre aux doutes qui ont été exprimés, les partisans de la langue maternelle peuvent citer l’exemple du Japon. Le Révérend X. S. Holland, Directeur de St Paul’s College à Calcutta, a écrit dans sa réponse: «Le Japon, en se servant de sa langue maternelle, a établi un système d’éducation qui commande le respect de l’Occident.» Le témoignage de Babu Amananda Chatterjee est encore plus convaincant. Il écrit: «L’emploi des langues indigènes est nécessairement indispensable, à tous les degrés d’une éducation universitaire. Toutes les objections n’ont de force que temporairement: car, à l’origine, toutes les langues modernes les plus développées n’étaient pas supérieures au bengali. Le développement de ces langues se fit par l’usage, et il en sera de même en ce qui nous concerne». No
U||us voyons donc que si le rapport qui se trouve actuellement sous les yeux de la Commission Sadler n’est pas aujourd’hui en faveur de l’éducation Universitaire en langue indigène, il permet cependant d’avoir pour cette cause de sérieuses espérances dans l’avenir. Il fut un temps où celle-ci était considérée avec méfiance. Non seulement la méfiance a disparu, mais elle a été remplacée par la confiance. Deux institutions sont venues récemment se joindre à cette cause: l’Université féminine de Poona et l’Université Osmania à Hyderabab, qui se servent uniquement des langues indigènes dans leur enseignement. Leur progrès est suivi avec beaucoup d’intérêt par un grand nombre. Leur succès, ainsi que l’a dit le magistrat 52 Sir Abdur Rahi, facilitera la solution du problème des langues indigènes. A la dernière réunion de l’Université Hindoue, l’Honorable Pundit Madan Mohan Malavijiya invita tous les éminents partisans des langues indigènes à se réunir en confére
U||nce. Nous espérons qu’une initiative de ce genre aura pour résultat de hâter l’emploi des langues indigènes dans l’enseignement.
U||La division actuelle des provinces est un facteur qui contribue également à faire beaucoup de tort à la cause des langues indigènes. Une division nouvelle des provinces sur une base linguistique sera suivie de la réorganisation des Universités.
U||Nous venons d’exposer les trois sphères d’activité pour la cause des langues indigènes. Il est évident que si nous ne la faisons pas progresser, nous ne parviendrons jamais à combler le gouffre grandissant qui sépare au point de vue de l’intelligence et de la culture les classes supérieures de la masse du peuple. Il est certain que, pour beaucoup de gens, seul l’emploi de la langue maternelle peut stimuler l’originalité de la pensée.

U||AUX MEMBRES DE LA «LIGUE POUR LE HOME RULE DE L’INDE»
U||Je m’écarte d’une façon très nette du cours régulier de ma vie, en appartenant à une organisation essentiellement et franchement politique. Mais après avoir sérieusement réfléchi et consulté mes amis, je me suis décidé à faire partie de la Ligue pour le Home Rule de l’Inde, et j’en ai accepté la présidence. Certains amis consultés m’ont dit que je ne devais pas faire partie d’une association politique, parce que je perdais ainsi la position de superbe isolement dont je jouissais à présent. J’avoue que ce conseil m’a fait beaucoup hésiter; mais j’ai eu en même temps l’impression que, si la Ligue m’acceptait tel que j’étais, j’aurais tort de ne pas m’unir à une organisation dont je pourrais me servir pour le progrès des causes dont je m’occupe particulièrement et des méthodes qui doivent obtenir, je le sais par expérience, des résultats plus rapides et plus satisfaisants. Avant de faire partie de la ligue, j’ai essayé de connaître l’opinion de ceux
U|| qui se trouvaient en dehors de la Province et avec lesquels je n’avais pas l’occasion d’avoir des rapports aussi intimes qu’avec mes collaborateurs de la Province de Bombay.
U||Les causes auxquelles j’ai fait allusion plus haut 54 sont le Swadeshi, l’Union Hindoue-Musulmane en insistant sur la question du Califat, l’hindoustani accepté comme lingua franca, et une réorganisation linguistique des provinces. Si je parvenais à entraîner les membres de cette Ligue, je ferais en sorte que la majeure partie du temps et de l’attention de la nation leur fût consacrée.
U||J’avoue franchement que les réformes ont une place tout à fait secondaire dans mon plan de réorganisation sociale. Je suis persuadé que si les sphères d’activité que j’ai choisies pouvaient absorber l’énergie nationale tout entière, les réformes désirées par les extrémistes les plus ardents viendraient d’elles-mêmes. Quant au Gouvernement indépendant, il est souhaitable que nous l’ayons au plus tôt. Personne plus que moi n’a le désir de hâter notre marche vers ce but. Et c’est justement parce que j’ai l’impression que l’on avancera plus rapidement vers un gouvernement indépendant, en développant les activités dont j’ai parlé, que je les maintiens au premier plan du programme national. Je ne considérerai pas la Ligue pour le Home Rule de l’Inde comme une organisation de parti. Je n’appartiens à aucun parti et ne veux appartenir à aucun. Je sais que, d’après la constitution de la Ligue celle-ci est tenue d’aider le Congrès, mais je ne considère pas plu
U||s le Congrès comme une organisation de parti que le Parlement Britannique, bien qu’il renferme tous les partis et que l’un ou l’autre y domine tour à tour. J’ose espérer que tous les partis seront attachés au Congrès, le considérant comme une organisation nationale, qui offre à tous le moyen de s’adresser à la nation, afin de pouvoir donner une forme à sa politique, et je voudrais essayer 55 de façonner la politique de la Ligue de telle sorte que le Congrès conserve son caractère national et indépendant de tout parti.
U||Ceci m’amène à parler de mes méthodes. Je crois possible de mettre dans la vie politique de ce pays la Vérité et la Sincérité absolues. Je ne m’attendrai pas à ce que la Ligue me suive dans ma Désobéissance Civile; mais je ferai de mon mieux pour que la Vérité et la Non-Violence soient adoptées dans toutes nos activités nationales. Nous cesserons alors d’avoir de la crainte et de la méfiance vis-à-vis des gouvernements et des mesures qu’ils prennent. Je ne tiens pas à développer la question davantage, je préfère laisser au temps le soin de résoudre plusieurs points qui naîtront de ce que je viens d’exposer sommairement...
U||28 avril 1920.
U||LES EMPLOIS DU KHADDAR
U||Maintenant que le mouvement du Swadeshi avance à grands pas et que les Mahométans l’adoptent avec autant d’enthousiasme que les Hindous, il serait bon de considérer la meilleure façon de l’encourager. Le moindre novice en Swadeshi sait que nous ne fabriquons pas assez de tissus pour nos besoins. Et par conséquent, si nous ne faisons qu’employer le tissu 56 des filatures, nous privons simplement les pauvres de ce qui leur est nécessaire, ou tout au moins nous en faisons monter le prix. La seule façon d’encourager le Swadeshi est de fabriquer plus de tissus. Les filatures ne sauraient pousser comme des champignons. Il faut par conséquent que nous nous contentions de tissus filés et tissés à la main. Le fil n’a jamais coûté si cher et les filatures font des bénéfices fabuleux. Filer au rouet aiderait à la production et en ferait diminuer le prix.
U||Comment s’y prendre pour filer et tisser? Voilà la seconde question qui se pose. Je sais par expérience personnelle qu’il est possible d’inonder le marché de fil et de tissus filés et tissés à la main, si l’on arrive à considérer ce tissu type comme assez bon pour qu’on s’en vêtisse. Ce tissu dans l’Inde du Nord porte le nom de Khaddar, et de Khadi dans la Présidence de Bombay. Je remercie Sarala Devi; elle a montré que l’on pouvait confectionner même des sari avec du Khaddar. Elle se dit qu’il lui serait facile de le démontrer, si elle en portait un elle-même, pendant la Semaine Nationale, ce qu’elle fit; et c’est en sari de Khaddar qu’elle assista à toutes les réunions. Ses amis ne croyaient pas que cela fût possible. Ils pensaient qu’une jeune femme habituée à ne porter que la soie la plus fine et la plus légère mousseline de Dacca ne pourrait tolérer le poids du Khaddar. Elle donna un démenti à toutes les craintes et ne fut ni moins active dans son sari d
U||e Khaddar que dans ses sari de soie fine. «Si vous ne vous sentez pas gênée dans ce sari, vous pouvez aller n’importe où, assister à n’importe quelle réunion, en toute tranquillité»: ainsi s’exprima son grand-oncle Sir Rabindranath Tagore, 57 en lui donnant sa bénédiction, lorsqu’il l’aperçut ainsi vêtue. Si je rapporte cet incident, c’est afin de démontrer que deux des personnes qui ont la réputation d’être les plus artistes de l’Inde ne trouvèrent rien dans le Khaddar qui ne fût pas artistique. Voilà le tissu dont je veux introduire l’usage dans les familles cultivées de l’Inde, car de son emploi dépend le succès initial du mouvement Swadeshi. Pour moi, le Khaddar est bien autrement artistique que la mousseline de Dacca à cause de tous les souvenirs qui s’y associent. Le Khaddar fait vivre aujourd’hui ceux qui mouraient de faim. Il fait vivre des femmes que l’on a tirées d’une vie de honte, ou des femmes qui ne voulant pas travailler au dehors se querellai
U||ent entre elles faute d’avoir une occupation. Le Khaddar a donc une âme, une personnalité. Celui qui le porte peut suivre le procédé de sa fabrication et remonter jusqu’à ceux qui l’ont fait. Si nos goûts n’étaient pas aussi avilis, nous préférerions le Khaddar au calicot poisseux, même pendant l’été. Que ceux qui en portent maintenant, s’ils le veulent bien, témoignent de la vérité de ce que j’avance!
U||Il existe à présent un dépôt de Khaddar au Satyâgraha Ashram. J’en ai amassé un stock bien supérieur à l’espace dont je dispose. Je prie donc les lecteurs de la Jeune Inde de m’aider, en le faisant connaître dans leurs familles. Il va sans dire que l’Ashram n’en tire aucun profit. Tout bénéfice réalisé sert au recouvrement des pertes faites au début, ou à la diminution du prix du Khaddar provenant de régions où le prix en est plus élevé, car celui-ci varie. Je suis obligé de payer suffisamment les tisseurs à qui j’ai persuadé 58 de reprendre leur ancienne occupation, pour qu’ils puissent vivre pour l’instant.
U||On peut employer le Khaddar pour confectionner du linge, si l’on n’est pas disposé à s’en vêtir. Mais même si l’on ne tient pas à l’employer pour un usage personnel, on peut en faire des bonnets, des nappes, des sacs, des draps, des toiles à matelas, des sacs de voyage, des carpettes, des housses, etc. J’en fais teindre en rouge vif, en teinture Swadeshi. Cette teinture rend le Khaddar plus résistant et moins salissant pour les tapis, la literie ou les sièges. Je conseillerais à ceux qui veulent aider cette industrie des pauvres et des déshérités, d’envoyer leur commande de Khaddar au Directeur, Service du Khaddar, Satyâgraha Ashram à Sabarmati.

U||NI SAINT NI HOMME POLITIQUE
U||Un aimable ami m’a envoyé la coupure ci-jointe du numéro d’avril de East and West:
U||«M. Gandhi a la réputation d’être un Saint; mais dans ses discours, il semble que ce soit l’homme politique qui domine. Il s’est beaucoup servi des hartals, et l’on ne peut nier que sous sa direction le hartal ne soit en passe de devenir une arme politique puissante, unissant sur toute question ceux qui ont de l’éducation et ceux qui n’en ont pas. Le hartal n’est pas dépourvu de désavantages. Il enseigne l’action directe; et l’action directe, si puissante soit-elle, ne travaille pas à l’union. M. Gandhi est-il absolument sûr de servir les injonctions les plus nobles d’Ahimsâ: ne faire aucun mal? Sa proposition de commémorer la tragédie du Jallianwala Bagh n’est pas de nature à faire naître l’harmonie. Ce fut un événement tragique où notre gouvernement se vit entraîné; mais ce souvenir amer mérite-t-il qu’on le conserve? Ne pourrait-on, pour commémorer cet événement, ériger un temple de la paix, qui aidât les veuves et les orphelins à bénir le nom de ceux 
U||qui sont morts, sans savoir pourquoi? Le monde est rempli de politiciens et de chicaneurs qui, au nom de patriotisme, empoisonnent chez l’homme ce qu’il 60 y a de plus doux; comme résultat, nous avons des guerres, des haines et des crimes honteux, comme celui qui fit un abattoir du Jallianwa Bagh. Ne pouvons-nous à présent essayer d’une symbiose plus large, telle qu’en prêchèrent Bouddha et le Christ, et amener l’univers entier à vivre heureux dans l’union. M. Gandhi semblait destiné à devenir l’apôtre d’un mouvement de ce genre; mais les circonstances sont en train de le contraindre à chercher le moyen d’exciter la résistance de groupes isolés. Il n’est pas trop tard pour qu’il entreprenne la mission plus vaste d’unir le monde entier!»
U||Je cite le passage en entier. En général, je ne tiens pas compte des critiques que l’on fait de moi ou de mes méthodes, sauf lorsque j’avoue m’être trompé, ou lorsque je veux insister sur les principes qui font l’objet de la critique. J’ai une double raison pour tenir compte de ce passage. Non seulement je tiens à élucider des principes qui me sont chers, mais je tiens également à témoigner mon estime à l’auteur de cette critique, que je connais et que j’ai admiré pendant de longues années, pour la beauté remarquable de son caractère. Le critique regrette de voir en moi un politicien, alors qu’il s’attendait à ce que je fusse un saint. Je trouve, pour commencer, que le mot «saint» devrait être rayé de la vie présente[63].
U||C’est un terme beaucoup trop sacré pour qu’on l’applique à n’importe qui, et surtout à quelqu’un comme moi, qui n’ai d’autre prétention que de chercher la 61 62 vérité, qui sais si bien ce qui lui manque, qui se trompe et qui n’hésite jamais à le reconnaître, qui avoue franchement que, pareil à l’homme de science, il fait des expériences sur certaines vérités éternelles de la vie, mais qu’il ne peut même pas prétendre en être un, parce qu’il ne peut donner aucune preuve évidente de l’exactitude scientifique de ses méthodes, ni des résultats tangibles de ses expériences. Cependant, et quoiqu’en renonçant à la sainteté je désappointe l’attente du critique, je voudrais dissiper ses regrets, en lui répondant que le politicien n’a jamais influencé aucune de mes décisions, et que si je m’occupe de politique, c’est simplement parce qu’aujourd’hui la politique s’enroule autour de nous comme les replis d’un serpent dont on ne peut se dégager, quel
U||que 63 mal qu’on se donne. J’ai donc l’intention de lutter contre ce serpent, comme je l’ai fait consciemment, avec plus ou moins de succès, depuis 1894, et inconsciemment, ainsi que je l’ai découvert, depuis que j’ai l’âge de raison. Tout à fait égoïstement, comme je tiens à vivre en paix au milieu de l’orage déchaîné autour de moi, j’ai fait des expériences sur moi-même et sur mes amis, en introduisant la religion dans la politique. Permettez-moi de vous expliquer ce que j’entends par la religion. Ce n’est pas la religion Hindoue, à laquelle j’attache certainement plus de prix qu’à toute autre, mais la religion qui dépasse l’Hindouisme, qui transforme notre nature même, qui nous unit indissolublement avec la vérité qui est en nous et qui toujours purifie. C’est l’élément permanent de la nature humaine qui ne considère jamais le prix trop élevé lorsqu’il s’agit d’arriver à son expression complète, et qui laisse l’âme absolument inquiète tant
U|| qu’elle ne s’est pas découverte, tant qu’elle ne connaît pas son Créateur et qu’elle n’a pu apprécier le véritable rapport qui existe entre elle-même et son Créateur.
U||Voilà dans quel état d’esprit religieux je me trouvais lorsque j’ai pensé au hartal. Je voulus démontrer que ce ne sont pas les connaissances littéraires qui rendront l’Inde consciente de ce qu’elle est, ni qui uniront ceux qui sont instruits. Le hartal, comme par magie, éclaira l’Inde entière, le 6 avril 1919. Et sans l’interruption dont Satan fut cause, en soufflant la crainte à l’oreille d’un gouvernement conscient de ses torts, et qui incita à la colère un peuple qui y était préparé par sa défiance vis-à-vis du Gouvernement, l’Inde se fût élevée à une hauteur incomparable. Non seulement 64 le hartal avait été adopté par des foules nombreuses, dans un esprit absolument religieux, mais celui-ci devait être le prélude d’une série d’Actions directes.
U||Seulement mon critique déplore l’action directe, «parce qu’elle ne travaille pas à unir». Je suis tout disposé à discuter ce point. Rien, sur cette terre, n’a jamais été accompli sans action directe. Je n’ai pas voulu adopter l’expression «résistance passive», parce qu’elle est considérée comme l’arme des faibles. C’est l’action directe qui, dans l’Afrique du Sud donna des résultats, et des résultats si satisfaisants qu’ils ramenèrent le Général Smuts à la raison. En 1906 il était l’adversaire le plus implacable des aspirations indiennes. En 1914, il se montrait fier d’avoir fait tardivement justice en supprimant du Livre des Statuts une clause honteuse, laquelle, avait-il déclaré en 1909, ne serait jamais supprimée, parce que, disait-il alors, «l’Afrique du Sud ne tolérerait jamais l’abrogation d’une décision confirmée deux fois par le Parlement du Transvaal.» Et qui plus est, l’action maintenue pendant huit ans ne laissa subsister après elle au
U||cune amertume, et ces mêmes Indiens qui avaient lutté si obstinément contre le Général Smuts se groupèrent autour de son drapeau en 1915, et se battirent sous ses ordres dans l’Afrique Orientale. A Champaran, ce fut l’action directe qui mit fin à des griefs séculaires. Se soumettre humblement, lorsqu’on est irrité par des injustices ou par une impuissance législative que l’on voudrait voir supprimée, non seulement ne contribue pas à unir, mais aigrit celui qui est faible, l’irrite et le dispose à saisir l’occasion d’éclater, lorsqu’elle se présente. En m’alliant au parti faible, en 65 lui enseignant une action directe, ferme et inoffensive, je lui donne le sentiment d’être fort et d’être capable de défier la force physique. Il se sent fortifié par la lutte, reprend conscience et, sachant qu’en lui-même il trouvera le remède, il cesse de nourrir dans son sein l’esprit de vengeance et apprend à se montrer satisfait, si l’injustice à laquelle il veut remédier 
U||est réparée.
U||C’est dans cet ordre d’idées que je me suis permis de proposer un monument commémoratif pour le Jallianwala Bagh. L’auteur d’East and West m’attribue l’intention d’avoir voulu suggérer ce qui ne m’était pas même venu à l’esprit. Il pense que je désire commémorer le crime commis au Jallianwala Bagh. Rien ne saurait être plus éloigné de ma pensée que de vouloir perpétuer le souvenir d’une action aussi noire. Sans doute, avant d’avoir obtenu ce à quoi nous avons droit, nous aurons une répétition de cette tragédie, et j’y préparerai la nation en faisant conserver pieusement la mémoire de morts innocents. Les veuves et les orphelins ont reçu et reçoivent des secours, mais nous ne pouvons «bénir le nom de ceux qui sont morts sans savoir pourquoi», si nous n’acquérons pas le terrain rendu sacré par le sang versé, pour y élever le monument convenable. Ce n’est pas afin qu’il serve à rappeler une action vile, si je puis faire autrement, mais afin de communiqu
U||er à la nation cet encouragement qu’il vaut mieux mourir faibles et non armés, et en victimes plutôt qu’en tyrans. Je voudrais que les générations futures se souviennent que nous qui avons été témoins de leur mort innocente n’avons pas avec ingratitude refusé de chérir leur souvenir. Ainsi que le fit remarquer Mrs Jinnah en 66 donnant sa petite obole: «le monument nous fournira au moins l’excuse de vivre». En somme, c’est l’esprit dans lequel le monument sera élevé qui décidera de son caractère.
U||Quelle fut la plus vaste symbiose que prêchèrent Bouddha et le Christ? Bouddha porta hardiment la guerre dans le camp ennemi et fit tomber à genoux les prêtres arrogants. Le Christ chassa les marchands et les changeurs du temple de Jérusalem et fit tomber sur les arrogants et les hypocrites les anathèmes du ciel. Tous deux étaient intensément partisans de l’action directe. Mais si le Christ et Bouddha châtièrent tous deux, derrière chacun de leurs actes se cachaient une bonté et un amour indéniables. Ils n’auraient pas levé la main contre un ennemi et auraient préféré se livrer qu’abandonner la Vérité, pour laquelle ils vivaient. Bouddha serait mort en résistant aux prêtres, si la noblesse de son amour n’avait pas suffi à la tâche de les faire plier. Le Christ mourut sur la croix et couronné d’épines, défiant tout l’Empire. Et si je soulève la résistance non-violente, je ne fais que suivre humblement le chemin tracé par les grands maîtres, que le critique a nommés.
U||Enfin, l’auteur de l’article s’en prend à ce que je groupe des unités; il voudrait que j’entreprisse la mission plus vaste d’unir le monde. Je lui ai dit, un jour que lui et moi nous trouvions réunis sous le même toit, que j’étais probablement plus cosmopolite que lui. Je m’en tiens à cette expression, à moins de grouper des unités, je ne parviendrai jamais à unir le monde entier. Tolstoï a dit un jour que si seulement nous consentions à ne pas nous occuper des 67 taches de nos voisins, le monde s’en tirerait parfaitement, sans que nous fissions autre chose. Et si seulement nous pouvons aider nos proches voisins, en cessant d’en faire notre proie, le cercle d’unités groupées comme il faut grandira sans cesse jusqu’au moment où il se confondra avec le monde entier. Nul ne peut essayer d’en accomplir davantage. Yatthaa pindhé thatthaa brahmandé[64] est aussi vrai à l’heure présente qu’il y a des siècles, lorsque ces mots furent prononcés par quelque Rishi inconnu

U||COMMENT ORGANISER
U||LA NON-COOPÉRATION
U||La meilleure façon de répondre aux critiques et aux craintes exprimées, au sujet de la Non-Coopération, est peut-être d’en établir un programme plus complet. Les critiques semblent s’imaginer que les organisateurs ont l’intention de mettre en action, d’un seul coup, tout ce qui a été projeté. A dire vrai, les organisateurs ont fixé quatre étapes définies et 68 progressives. La première consiste à faire l’abandon de tous titres et à renoncer à toute fonction honorifique. S’il n’y a pas de résultat, ou si le résultat ne produit pas l’effet souhaité, on aura recours à la seconde. Celle-ci nécessite beaucoup de préparatifs préliminaires. Il est certain qu’on ne fera cesser le travail à un employé n’ayant pas les moyens de subvenir à ses besoins personnels et à ceux de sa famille, que si le Comité pour le Califat peut en assumer la charge. Tous les services ne seront pas invités à cesser le travail en même temps, et jamais aucune pression ne sera exercée sur un 
U||employé, pour l’obliger à abandonner le service du Gouvernement, de même qu’on ne touchera à aucun patron privé, pour la simple raison que le Mouvement n’est pas anti-Anglais. Il n’est même pas anti-Gouvernemental.
U||Il nous faut refuser de coopérer avec le Gouvernement, parce que le peuple ne doit pas se faire le complice d’une injustice, d’un serment violé,—de la profanation d’un profond sentiment religieux. Il va de soi que le mouvement sera retardé, si une pression indue s’exerce sur un employé, ou si un membre du Comité pour le Califat emploie la violence ou l’approuve. La seconde phase ne peut manquer de réussir complètement, si elle est adoptée par un nombre raisonnable de citoyens, car nul gouvernement, le gouvernement indien moins que tout autre, ne pourrait subsister si le peuple cessait de le servir. La troisième phase—le retrait des troupes et de la Police—est lointaine. Les organisateurs néanmoins ont voulu être justes, agir ouvertement, et se montrer au-dessus de tout soupçon. Ils n’ont pas voulu cacher 69 au gouvernement ou au public une seule des mesures qu’ils se proposaient d’adopter, même en cas d’éventualité éloignée. La quatrième phase, c’est-à-dire le ref
U||us de payer les impôts, est plus lointaine encore. Les organisateurs reconnaissent que suspendre le payement des impôts généraux est fort dangereux. Il est probable qu’une certaine classe de gens impulsifs se verront aux prises avec la police. Aussi, les organisateurs ne s’y engageront pas, sans être absolument certains qu’il n’y aura aucune violence de la part du peuple.
U||J’admets, comme je l’ai déjà fait, que la Non-Coopération ne peut avoir lieu sans risques; mais les risques de l’indolence devant un problème grave sont infiniment plus grands que le danger de la violence, que peut faire naître l’organisation de la Non-Coopération. Ne rien faire est le moyen certain d’appeler la violence...
U||Ceux dont la cause est juste ne se sont jamais contentés d’une simple protestation. Certains sont morts pour elle. Peut-on s’attendre à ce qu’un peuple aussi fier que les Mahométans risque moins?

U||LA LOI DE LA SOUFFRANCE
U||Aucun pays ne s’est jamais élevé sans s’être purifié 70 au feu de la souffrance. Pour que les blés poussent, il faut que le grain périsse. La vie sort de la mort. L’Inde peut-elle sortir de son esclavage, sans obéir à la loi éternelle de la purification par la souffrance?
U||Si l’on en croyait certains, l’Inde accomplirait évidemment sa destinée sans pénible labeur. Ils tiennent surtout à ne pas voir se renouveler les événements du mois d’avril 1919. Ils craignent la Non-Coopération, parce qu’elle entraînera la souffrance d’un grand nombre. Si Hampden s’était tenu ce raisonnement, il n’eût pas refusé de payer l’impôt pour la construction de navires, et Wat Taylor n’eût pas davantage élevé l’idéal de la rébellion. L’Histoire d’Angleterre et l’Histoire de France abondent en exemples d’hommes, qui continuèrent à poursuivre un but qui était juste, sans s’inquiéter de la souffrance entraînée par là. Ils ne s’attardaient pas à réfléchir si des gens ignorants allaient souffrir, sans le vouloir. Pourquoi prétendrions-nous écrire notre Histoire différemment? Nous pouvons, si nous le désirons, profiter des erreurs de nos prédécesseurs pour faire mieux; mais il nous est impossible de supprimer la loi de la souffrance, qui est
U|| inhérente à notre être. Le seul moyen de mieux faire serait, si possible, d’éviter qu’il y eût violence de notre côté, afin de hâter ainsi la marche du progrès et d’introduire dans les méthodes de souffrance une pureté plus grande. Si nous le voulons, nous pouvons prendre sur nous de ne pas contraindre le coupable, par la force physique, à plier devant notre volonté comme le font aujourd’hui les Sinn Feiners, ou bien, nous pouvons, par la coercition, obliger nos voisins à adopter nos méthodes, ainsi que certains l’ont fait 71 pour le hartal. Le progrès dépend de la somme de souffrance endurée par la victime. Plus la souffrance est pure, plus le progrès est grand. C’est pourquoi le sacrifice de Jésus suffit à rendre libre un monde accablé de maux. Dans sa marche vers le but, il ne tint pas compte du prix de la souffrance imposée à son prochain, que celui-ci l’ait volontairement endurée ou non. C’est ainsi que les souffrances d’Harishandra suffirent à rétablir le r
U||oyaume de la vérité. Il devait savoir que ses sujets souffriraient involontairement de son abdication. Il ne s’en inquiéta pas, parce qu’il ne pouvait pas faire autre chose que suivre la vérité.
U||J’ai déjà dit que je ne déplorais pas tant le massacre de Jallianwala Bagh que le meurtre d’Anglais commis par nous-mêmes et la destruction de biens. Les horribles événements d’Amritsar détournèrent l’attention publique d’horreurs plus grandes, quoique plus lentes, qui avaient lieu à Lahore, où par un lent procédé on tentait de dégrader les habitants. Mais avant de nous élever, nous aurons à supporter maintes fois des procédés semblables, jusqu’au jour où nous aurons appris à souffrir volontairement et à y trouver de la joie. Je suis convaincu que les habitants de Lahore n’ont jamais rien fait pour mériter les insultes cruelles qu’on leur a infligées; jamais ils n’ont fait de mal à un seul Anglais, jamais ils n’ont détruit de biens. Mais un maître obstiné était résolu à broyer l’esprit d’un peuple qui essayait de se débarrasser d’un bât qui le blessait. Et si l’on me disait que tout ceci arrive parce que j’ai prêché le Satyâgraha, je répondrais
U|| qu’en ce cas je n’en continuerai à le prêcher qu’avec plus de vigueur, et cela tant qu’il me restera du souffle pour le faire, et je dirais 72 qu’à la prochaine occasion, ils devront répondre à l’insolence d’un O’Dwyer, non pas en ouvrant leurs boutiques sous la menace de ventes forcées, mais en laissant le tyran accomplir sa mauvaise action jusqu’au bout et vendre tout ce qu’ils possèdent, sauf leur âme indomptable. Les Sages de l’antiquité mortifiaient leur chair, pour que leur âme devînt libre et que leur corps pût supporter n’importe quelle souffrance infligée par des tyrans prétendant leur imposer leur volonté. Et si l’Inde désire retrouver son antique sagesse, si l’Inde veut éviter les erreurs de l’Europe, je supplierai ses fils et ses filles de ne pas se laisser tromper par de belles phrases, par les subtilités qui nous emprisonnent, par la crainte des souffrances que l’Inde devra peut-être endurer, mais de considérer ce qui arrive aujourd’hui en 
U||Europe et de se rendre compte ainsi qu’il nous faudra souffrir comme l’Europe a souffert, mais non pas faire souffrir les autres. L’Allemagne voulait dominer l’Europe, et les Alliés voulaient faire de même, en écrasant l’Allemagne. L’Europe n’a rien gagné à la chute de l’Allemagne. Les Alliés se sont montrés tout aussi faux, tout aussi cruels, tout aussi avides que l’Allemagne le fut ou l’eût été. L’Allemagne ne serait pas tombée dans l’exagération (hypocritement dévote), que l’on remarque dans un grand nombre des actions des Alliés.
U||L’erreur que j’ai déplorée l’an dernier ne se rapportait pas aux souffrances infligées au peuple, mais aux fautes qu’il a commises, à la violence employée, toutes choses provenant de ce qu’il n’avait pas suffisamment compris le Message du Satyâgraha. Quel est donc le sens de la Non-Coopération, selon la loi de la Souffrance? Il nous faut accepter volontairement 73 les pertes et les désagréments que nous causera l’obligation de retirer notre appui à un gouvernement qui agit contrairement à notre volonté. Le pouvoir et la fortune sont des crimes, sous un gouvernement injuste. «La pauvreté, en ce cas, dit Thoreau, est une vertu». Il se peut que, dans la période de transition, nous commettions des fautes, que certaines souffrances soient infligées, que nous aurions pu éviter. Tout cela est préférable à l’émasculation de la nation.
U||Il nous faut refuser d’attendre que le mal soit réparé, que le coupable ait conscience de son iniquité. Il ne faut pas que nous continuions à participer au mal, parce que nous avons peur de souffrir ou de faire souffrir les autres. Nous devons combattre le mal, en cessant d’aider directement ou indirectement celui qui fait le mal.
U||Lorsqu’un père commet une injustice, le devoir de ses enfants est de quitter le toit paternel; lorsque le directeur d’une institution dirige son école d’après des principes contraires à la morale, le devoir des élèves est de quitter l’école; lorsque le président d’une corporation est corrompu, le devoir des membres de la corporation est de n’avoir aucun rapport avec lui et de s’écarter de sa corruption. Il en est de même lorsqu’un gouvernement commet une grave injustice: celui qui en est le sujet doit lui retirer sa coopération entière ou partielle, jusqu’à ce qu’il l’ait amené à renoncer à son injustice. Dans chacun de ces cas imaginés par moi, il y a un élément de souffrance physique ou morale. La liberté ne saurait s’acquérir qu’à ce prix.

U||DEVOIR DES HABITANTS DU PENDJAB
U||Le Leader d’Allahabad mérite qu’on le félicite d’avoir publié la correspondance qu’il a reçue au sujet de M. R. Bosworth Smith, l’un des officiers responsables de l’application de la loi martiale et contre lesquels les plaintes de mauvais traitements répétés et persistants sont des plus amères. D’après cette correspondance, il paraîtrait qu’au lieu d’être destitué, Mr Bosworth Smith aurait reçu de l’avancement. Quelque temps avant la mise en vigueur de la loi martiale, Mr Bosworth Smith avait été suspendu de ses fonctions; or non seulement on lui avait rendu son poste de Deputy Commissioner[65], mais on l’avait investi de nouveaux pouvoirs le chargeant de faire appliquer le paragraphe 30 du Code Criminel. Depuis son arrivée, la malheureuse population de l’Inde vit sous un régime de terreur et de tyrannie. Notre correspondant ajoute: «J’emploie ces deux mots avec intention, afin de bien exprimer ce que je veux dire». J’extrais de sa lettre quelques passages qui j
U||ettent un peu de lumière et qui expliquent ce qu’il entend par terreur et tyrannie. «Lorsqu’il s’agit de plaintes privées, il 75 n’en prend jamais note... Le rapporteur les inscrit à la fin de la séance, et le lendemain le magistrat les signe. Que le rapport soit ou non en faveur du plaignant, le magistrat n’y jette jamais les yeux; ces plaintes sont réservées sans avoir été jugées convenablement. En ce qui concerne les Challans de la police, ceux qui plaident pour les accusés n’ont pas l’autorisation de communiquer avec les prisonniers en jugement, qui sont sous la garde de la police. Ils n’ont pas le droit de contre-examiner les témoins à charge... Des questions suggérant les réponses sont posées aux témoins de l’accusation... De cette façon, toute une histoire accusatrice se trouve mise dans la bouche des témoins de la police. Les témoins à décharge, bien qu’appelés, ne sont pas autorisés à être interrogés par les avocats de la défense... N’importe quel fo
U||nctionnaire d’un «Cantonnement» n’a qu’à écrire le nom d’un habitant du «Cantonnement» sur un chiffon de papier et lui donner l’ordre de comparaître le lendemain devant le tribunal pour qu’il y soit obligé: c’est une sommation... S’il ne se présente pas, il reçoit un mandat d’arrêt.» La lettre en question cite bien d’autres exemples de ce genre qui mériteraient d’être publiés; mais ceci suffit pour expliquer ce que veut dire l’auteur. Permettez-moi d’examiner un peu la conduite de ce fonctionnaire pendant l’application de la Loi Martiale. C’est lui qui jugea en bloc et condamna, après un jugement qui n’était qu’une farce. Des témoins ont déclaré qu’il convoquait les gens et les forçait à faire de fausses dépositions, qu’il soulevait le voile des femmes, les insultait en les appelant chiennes, ânesses, qu’il crachait sur elles. C’est 76 lui qui fit endurer aux plaignants innocents de Shekhupera une persécution impossible à décrire. Mr Andrew
U||s a mené une enquête personnelle, au sujet des plaintes qui ont été faites contre ce fonctionnaire, et en est venu à cette conclusion qu’il n’est pas de fonctionnaire qui ait plus mal agi que Mr Smith... Sa déposition au Comité Hunter témoigne d’un mépris absolu de la vérité; et voilà l’homme qui vient de recevoir de l’avancement! La question est de savoir ce qu’il fait au service du gouvernement et pourquoi il n’a pas été mis en jugement, pour avoir maltraité et insulté des hommes et des femmes innocents.
U||Je vois que l’on voudrait que le Général Dyer et Sir Michael O’Dwyer fussent poursuivis. Je ne m’arrêterai pas à examiner si la chose est possible. J’ai regretté de voir que M. Shastri était de cet avis. Si les Anglais le faisaient d’eux-mêmes, je considérerais que ces poursuites attestent leur désapprobation de l’atrocité commise au Jallianwala Bagh. Mais je ne dépenserais certainement pas un liard en vaine tentative pour faire condamner ces hommes. Le public doit sûrement connaître assez l’esprit anglais. La presse anglaise presque tout entière conspire pour protéger ces coupables envers l’humanité. Je n’ai aucun désir d’aider à en faire des héros, en me joignant à ceux qui réclament leur mise en accusation. Une destitution qui s’impose d’une façon autrement péremptoire est celle de Mr Bosworth Smith, Deputy Commissioner, de Rai Shri Ram et de quelques autres dont le nom a été donné dans le rapport du Sous-Comité du Congrès. Quelque méprisable que soit l
U||e Général Dyer, je considère que Mr Smith l’est 77 bien davantage et que les crimes qu’il a commis sont bien autrement sérieux que le massacre du Jallianwala Bagh. Le Général Dyer croyait de bonne foi qu’effrayer le peuple en tirant dessus était l’acte d’un soldat. Mais Mr Smith fut cruel, vulgaire et vil, gratuitement. Si tous les faits qu’on lui reproche sont exacts, il n’y a absolument rien d’humain en lui. Il n’a pas comme le Général Dyer le courage d’admettre ce qu’il a fait. Quand on lui demande des explications, il se dérobe. Ce fonctionnaire conserve le pouvoir d’infliger sa présence à des gens qui ne lui ont rien fait et de continuer à déshonorer l’autorité qu’il représente.
U||Que fait le Pendjab pour remédier à ces choses? N’est-ce point le devoir très net de tout habitant du Pendjab de ne pas avoir de cesse tant que Mr Smith et ses pareils ne seront pas destitués. Les chefs du Pendjab auront recouvré leur liberté en vain s’ils ne l’emploient pas à purger l’administration de Mr Bosworth Smith et Compagnie. Je suis persuadé que s’ils veulent entreprendre une action résolue, ils seront soutenus par l’Inde entière. Je me permets de leur suggérer que la meilleure façon de se rendre capables d’envoyer le Général Dyer à la potence, c’est de remplir le devoir plus pressant et plus facile de mettre fin au mal que continuent à faire ces fonctionnaires, contre lesquels ils ont réuni des témoignages écrasants.

U||LE COMITÉ DE NON-COOPÉRATION
U||Il semble exister nombre de malentendus et d’idées fausses au sujet du Comité de Non-Coopération, nommé par le Comité pour le Califat, le 3 courant, à Allahabad. Un ami qui se trouvait à la réunion nous écrit pour nous dire que le Comité fut formé dans l’intention de mettre en vigueur la Non-Coopération et pour agir en toute circonstance s’y rapportant, comme s’il représentait la population musulmane de l’Inde entière, même au cas de remontrances présentées aux autorités. Que ceci dépasse les attributions du Comité, c’est ce que cet article va démontrer.
U||Ainsi que je l’indiquai, en proposant la formation du Comité, celui-ci doit s’assurer des désirs de la nation au sujet de la Non-Coopération et les faire exécuter. Il est un corps représentatif et possédant pleins pouvoirs; mais il n’est pas exact de dire—ce n’est pas son objet d’ailleurs—qu’il représente tout ce qu’il y a de meilleur dans l’opinion musulmane ou ce qui compte le plus. Par exemple, il ne représente pas la noblesse titrée de l’Islam. Cela ne concerne point le Comité. On l’a restreint exprès à un nombre de membres pouvant se consacrer entièrement à la tâche d’organiser la Non-Coopération et de s’assurer l’obéissance aux ordres donnés, la discipline et la Non-Violence. C’est un Comité de travailleurs pour 79 la cause. On ne peut s’attendre à ce que toute l’Inde musulmane soit également éclairée sur la Non-Coopération. Certains doutent de son efficacité, d’autres la considèrent comme un remède à l’eau de rose, un certain nombre l
U||a trouvent trop énergique pour l’Inde dans son état actuel. Ils déclarent que l’Inde n’a pas encore atteint la force de sacrifice nécessaire pour réussir. Les membres du Comité ne représentent pas et ne renferment pas ces éléments de doute, bien que par ailleurs ces derniers puissent avoir plus d’influence que certains musulmans faisant partie du Comité. Celui-ci est uniquement composé de membres ayant une foi profonde dans la Non-Coopération, et qui tout en étant convaincus n’exigeront pas de la nation des sacrifices supérieurs à ses forces; ils essayeront seulement de la mener, avec son programme, jusqu’où elle est capable d’aller; mais tout en agissant ainsi, ils n’hésiteront pas à aller eux-mêmes hardiment de l’avant et à entraîner ceux qui sont disposés à les suivre. Ce Comité, qui débute par conséquent sans réputation aucune, doit s’en faire une par son travail et par les résultats obtenus. Il ne saurait durer s’il ne fait rien ou si ayant travaillé, i
U||l n’aboutit à rien.
U||Il n’a aux yeux des étrangers aucune qualité représentative. Pour ceux-ci, Shaukat Ali est un homme aimable, mais un fanatique enragé, n’ayant d’empire sur personne; Hasrat Mohani, un homme inutile qui ne pense qu’au Swadeshi; le Dr Kitchlew, un homme d’hier qui ne possède aucune expérience du monde extérieur au-delà d’Amritsar. On peut en dire autant de la plupart des autres. Je suis assurément un individu supérieur, mais après tout un toqué, et un intrus 80 par-dessus le marché. Une pétition signée du Comité n’aura guère de poids auprès du monde extérieur, si elle doit dépendre de l’influence des signataires. Cela ne veut pas dire que le Comité n’en présentera aucune. Il en présentera certainement, lorsque la rapidité d’action sera essentielle ou lorsque pour certaines raisons de convenances, d’autres ne seront pas disposés à signer. A dire vrai, recueillir des signatures pour d’importantes pétitions sera un des moyens de sonder l’opinion publique; et on
U|| s’assurera ainsi de l’esprit de sacrifice dans l’élite du pays. Pour les masses et pour l’action intérieure, le Comité a une grande valeur représentative. Il serait probablement difficile de découvrir deux hommes représentant mieux l’opinion musulmane que Shaukat Ali et Hasrat Mohani. Les autres, bien que moins connus, ont été choisis pour les qualités, qu’on leur connaît, de force, de patience, de calme, de franchise, de courage devant les difficultés.
U||On a prétendu que je devrais être à la tête du mouvement. Cette déclaration n’est vraie qu’en partie[66]. Ce n’est pas par esprit d’humilité que je le 81 dis, mais parce que c’est rigoureusement exact. Si la croyance que je dirige le mouvement se répandait, cela pourrait lui être fatal. Je le dirige en ce sens que, pour l’instant, je suis celui dont les conseils sont 82 les plus appréciés et qui, plus que quiconque, a résolu de faire aboutir le programme de Non-Coopération. Mais je n’ai pas la prétention de représenter l’opinion musulmane. Je puis seulement essayer de l’interpréter. 83 Seul, il me serait impossible d’entraîner des masses musulmanes, et si j’essayais de vouloir discuter, à propos de religion, avec la meilleure opinion musulmane, je me verrais dûment hué par un 84 auditoire mixte. Seulement si j’étais Musulman, je ne craindrais point de discuter certaines questions devant une assemblée musulmane, même si je devais tenir tête à un grand nombre. Je
U|| considère que je suis un travailleur avisé; ma sagesse consiste en un sentiment très net de ce qui me manque. J’espère que je ne dépasse jamais mes limites; en tout cas ce n’est jamais consciemment. Il faut que tout Musulman intelligent se rappelle ce qui me manque et à quoi se bornent mes fonctions. L’ignorer serait fatal au succès du mouvement. Il ne faut pas qu’en m’associant avec le mouvement, je rende les travailleurs pour la Cause indolents et indifférents. Mon association avec le mouvement pour donner de bons résultats doit être la source d’une attention plus grande, d’un sentiment de responsabilité plus fort, d’une ardeur au travail supérieure et d’une activité plus efficace. Je puis élaborer des plans, mais leur exécution doit toujours demeurer entre les mains des travailleurs musulmans. Il faut que le mouvement soit organisé et dirigé par eux, avec l’aide d’amis comme moi, mais aussi sans leur aide s’il est nécessaire. Il ne faut pas s’attendre à ce que
U|| je forme des Non-Coopérateurs, les chefs musulmans seuls le peuvent. Quelle que soit l’étendue du sacrifice chez moi, elle ne peut produire dans le monde musulman l’esprit de Non-Coopération, c’est-à-dire de sacrifice, pour des questions religieuses. Il faudra que les chefs musulmans montrent cet esprit en eux-mêmes, avant que la masse le développe en elle.
U||Et maintenant, il m’est facile de répondre à la question: «Pourquoi n’y a-t-il pas d’Hindous au Comité?»—Le Comité suprême ne peut être composé 85 que de Musulmans. Je considère que ma présence même est un mal, mais un mal nécessaire, à cause de mes connaissances particulières. Je suis un spécialiste de la Non-Coopération. Je l’ai expérimentée avec succès. La résolution de Non-Coopération fut conçue par moi, à la conférence de Delhi. Je fais donc partie du Comité comme spécialiste, et non parce que je suis Hindou. Mes fonctions sont uniquement celles de conseiller. Que je sois un Hindou convaincu, persuadé que tout Hindou doit considérer de son devoir de soutenir les Musulmans jusqu’au bout de la Non-Coopération, c’est assurément un avantage pour le Comité. Mais cet avantage était à sa disposition, que j’en fisse partie ou non.
U||Puisque j’examine en ce moment les relations des Hindous avec le Mouvement pour le Califat, j’aimerais en profiter, quitte à me répéter, pour établir ma position bien nettement.
U||La réclamation des Musulmans me paraissant juste, j’ai l’intention de me joindre à eux jusqu’au bout de la Non-Coopération. Et je considère que cette attitude est absolument compatible avec la fidélité que je dois à la Grande-Bretagne. Seulement, je ne suivrais pas les Musulmans dans une campagne de violence. Je ne pourrais, par exemple, favoriser une invasion de l’Inde par l’Afghanistan, en vue d’obtenir de meilleures conditions de paix. A mon avis, le devoir d’un Hindou est de résister à toute incursion dans l’Inde, quand bien même ce serait dans le but mentionné plus haut. De même que son devoir est d’aider ses frères musulmans à obtenir satisfaction à leur juste demande, par la Non-Coopération ou par quelque autre forme de souffrance, si grande soit-elle, tant 86 qu’elle ne risque pas de faire perdre à l’Inde sa liberté et n’inflige de violence à personne. J’ajouterai que je me suis jeté à corps perdu dans la Non-Coopération, ne fût-ce que pour éviter un 
U||conflit armé de ce genre.

U||PROGRAMME DE NON-COOPERATION
U||Comment agir et quand.
U||Détails sur la première phase.
U||On a posé au Comité de Non-Coopération un grand nombre de questions pour savoir ce qu’il espérait faire et quelles étaient les méthodes à adopter pour commencer la Non-Coopération.
U||Le Comité désire faire bien comprendre que tout en s’attendant à ce que chacun réponde absolument à sa demande, il souhaite également entraîner les membres les moins résolus. Il veut enrôler la sympathie passive, sinon la coopération active du pays tout entier.
U||Par conséquent ceux qui ne pourraient faire de sacrifice physique peuvent aider en souscrivant, ou en travaillant pour le mouvement.
U||87
U||Si la Non-Coopération devient nécessaire, voici ce que le Comité a décidé pour la première phase:
U||1. Abandon de tous titres et postes honorifiques.
U||2. Refus de participer aux emprunts du Gouvernement.
U||3. Refus, de la part des avocats et hommes de loi, d’exercer leur profession. Règlement de tous les litiges par arbitrage privé.
U||4. Boycottage des Ecoles du Gouvernement par les parents.
U||5. Boycottage des Conseils Réformés.
U||6. Refus de prendre part aux réceptions du Gouvernement et autres cérémonies semblables.
U||7. Refus d’accepter tout poste militaire ou civil en Mésopotamie, ou de s’engager pour servir dans l’armée, particulièrement dans les territoires turcs actuellement administrés, en violation des promesses qui ont été faites.
U||8. Répandre le Swadeshi. Pousser vigoureusement au progrès du Swadeshi, en amenant les gens, au moment de cet éveil religieux et national, à se rendre compte que leur premier devoir envers leur pays est de se montrer satisfaits de ce qu’il produit et de ce qu’il manufacture.
U||Il faut faire progresser le Swadeshi, sans attendre le 1er Août. C’est une règle de conduite éternelle qu’on ne devra pas abandonner, même lorsque l’accord sera fait.
U||Il sera bon, dès maintenant de n’accepter ni poste civil, ni poste militaire, et de cesser de souscrire à tout emprunt du Gouvernement ancien ou récent.
U||Quant au reste, il faut se rappeler que la Non-Coopération ne commence pas avant le 1er Août prochain.
U||88
U||Nous faisons et ferons tout ce qui sera en notre pouvoir pour éviter d’avoir recours à une rupture aussi sérieuse avec le Gouvernement, en demandant avec instance aux Ministres de Sa Majesté de réclamer la révision d’un traité qui a été universellement condamné.
U||Ceux qui ont conscience de leur responsabilité et de la gravité de la cause n’agiront pas isolément, mais de concert avec le Comité. Le succès dépend entièrement d’une Non-Coopération disciplinée et concertée; et celle-ci est subordonnée à une stricte obéissance aux instructions, au calme et à l’absence totale de violence.
U||14 juillet 1920.
U||LA LOI DES MAJORITÉS
U||Mrs Besant a lu le compte-rendu du discours que j’ai fait à la Réunion organisée au Pendjab par les Ligues pour le Home Rule de l’Inde et l’Union Internationale de Bombay; et, voyant que j’ai réclamé des poursuites contre le Général Dyer et la mise en accusation de Sir Michael O’Dwyer, elle demande comment j’ai pu proposer une motion dont je n’avais pas approuvé les termes. M. Shastriar s’est également montré inquiet de cet acte. Je n’ai eu sous les 89 yeux aucun résumé de mon discours et ne puis dire par conséquent s’il a été convenablement reproduit. Comme j’ai parlé en gujerati, il est possible que la traduction donnée soit infidèle. Je vais essayer d’expliquer moi-même ma position. Je le fais volontiers, car j’estime que le principe soulevé par ces deux grands chefs est fort important.
U||On m’a souvent accusé d’avoir un caractère inflexible. On m’a dit que je ne voulais pas m’incliner devant la décision de la majorité. On m’a accusé d’être un autocrate... Je me flatte au contraire d’être de nature souple pour tout ce qui n’est pas d’importance vitale. J’ai horreur de l’autocratie. J’attache beaucoup trop de valeur à ma propre liberté et à ma propre indépendance pour ne pas les chérir chez autrui. Je ne désire pas qu’un seul être me suive, si je n’ai pas fait appel à sa raison. Je suis si peu conventionnel que j’irais jusqu’à renier la divinité des plus antiques Shastras, s’ils ne pouvaient convaincre ma raison. Mais l’expérience m’a démontré que, pour vivre dans la société et pour conserver mon indépendance, il me faut limiter l’indépendance absolue aux questions qui sont de la plus haute importance. Dans toutes les autres qui n’obligent pas à sacrifier sa religion ou son code moral, il faut s’incliner devant la majorité. 
U||Dans le cas présent, j’ai trouvé la possibilité d’expliquer mon attitude. Le pays a eu de nombreux exemples de ma nature inflexible. Elle était heureuse d’avoir une occasion de pouvoir céder sans danger. Je n’ai pas cessé de croire que le pays a tort de réclamer la poursuite du Général Dyer et la mise en accusation de Sir Michael. Mais ceci est l’affaire des Anglais. Mon but est de m’assurer que ceux 90 qui ont fait le mal quittent le service du Gouvernement. Rien de ce que j’ai vu depuis n’a fait changer mon opinion à ce sujet. Et c’est ce que j’ai dit clairement, à la réunion même, où j’ai proposé la motion. Je l’ai proposée, parce qu’il n’y a rien d’immoral à demander des poursuites contre le Général Dyer. Le pays a le droit de le faire. Le Sous-Comité du Congrès avait déclaré que l’abandon de ce droit serait assurément utile au bien de l’Inde. Je croyais par conséquent ma position tout à fait claire, à savoir: que j’étais toujours opposé à
U|| l’idée de poursuite, mais que néanmoins je n’avais aucune objection à proposer la motion, puisque celle-ci ne pouvait par elle-même faire aucun mal.
U||J’admets cependant que c’était une expérience dangereuse que de prendre cette résolution, pendant la crise que nous traversons. Tandis que nous élaborons de nouvelles règles de conduite pour le public et que nous essayons d’instruire, d’influencer et de guider les masses, il est dangereux de rien faire qui puisse les déconcerter ou nous donner l’apparence de «nous humilier devant la multitude». Je crois qu’à l’heure présente, il vaut mieux être qualifié d’obstiné et d’autocrate que d’avoir seulement l’air d’être influencé par la multitude, et de désirer son approbation. Ceux qui prétendent diriger les masses doivent résolument se refuser à se laisser mener par elles, si l’on veut éviter le règne de la populace déchaînée et si l’on désire pour le pays un progrès bien ordonné. Je crois que non seulement il est insuffisant de protester simplement de ses opinions et de se soumettre à l’opinion générale, mais qu’il est nécessaire dans les questions d
U||importance vitale que les chefs 91 agissent en sens inverse de l’opinion de la masse, si cette opinion ne se recommande pas à leur raison.
U||14 juillet 1920.
U||BOYCOTTAGE DES CONSEILS
U||Pundit Rambhuji Dutt Chaudhry s’est rangé parmi les adversaires de Lala Lajpat Rai au sujet du boycottage des Conseils. Madras est divisé, la plupart des chefs Nationalistes semblent peu disposés à boycotter les Conseils. Le Mahratta s’est déclaré contre cette mesure dans un article où il donne des arguments très justes. Ses raisons pour s’opposer au boycottage sont au nombre de deux. 1o Si les Nationalistes s’abstiennent, les Modérés auront tous les sièges. 2o Puisque nous avons fait quelque progrès avec les Conseils législatifs il est probable que nous en ferons davantage, lorsque les représentants du peuple auront des pouvoirs plus étendus.
U||La première raison ne fait guère honneur à un grand parti populaire. S’il est mauvais de faire partie des Conseils, pourquoi les Nationalistes seraient-ils jaloux d’y voir entrer les Modérés? Doivent-ils participer au mal parce que les Modérés ne veulent pas s’abstenir? ou bien se dit-on que le mal ne pourrait être évité que si tous s’unissent pour le boycottage? 92 Dans ce cas c’est montrer une ignorance totale du principe du boycottage. Nous boycottons une institution soit parce qu’elle nous déplaît, soit parce que nous ne voulons pas collaborer avec ceux qui la dirigent. Cette dernière raison seule est en cause pour les Conseils, et je déclare que dans un certain sens nous coopérons en en faisant partie, même si notre but est de faire de l’obstruction. La plupart des institutions, et particulièrement le Conseil Législatif Britannique, prospèrent malgré l’obstruction, et les obstructions disciplinées des Irlandais n’ont guère fait d’impression sur la Chambre des Co
U||mmunes. Les Irlandais n’ont pas obtenu le Home Rule qu’ils désiraient. Le Mahratta prétend que faire de l’obstruction serait de la Non-Coopération active et agressive. Je me permets d’y contredire. Selon moi c’est témoigner un manque de confiance en soi, c’est-à-dire en sa doctrine. On doute et on périt. Je ne crois pas que les chefs anglais ou Modérés puissent envisager avec tranquillité un boycottage nationaliste des Conseils. Nous voici face à face avec la réalité. Un seul Modéré tiendra-t-il à faire partie d’un Conseil si plus de la moitié des votants n’approuvent pas sa candidature? Je considère que ce ne serait pas constitutionnel car il ne représenterait pas sa circonscription. Le Boycottage que j’aurais en vue suppose une discipline des plus actives et une propagande attentive et s’appuie sur la croyance que les électeurs préfèreront un boycottage absolu à l’obstruction. Si l’on pense que le peuple lui-même ne désire pas le boycottage absolu le devoir d
U||e ceux qui y croient serait de démontrer aux électeurs combien le boycottage est supérieur à l’obstruction. Faire partie des Conseils 93 est se soumettre au vote de la majorité c’est-à-dire coopérer. Par conséquent si nous voulons arrêter les rouages du gouvernement, comme c’est le cas, jusqu’à ce que nous ayons obtenu justice au sujet du Califat et du Pendjab, il nous faut opposer toutes nos forces au Gouvernement et refuser d’accepter le vote de la Majorité au Conseil parce que celui-ci ne représente pas la volonté du pays ni la nôtre. Mieux vaut un ministre qui refuse ses services, qu’un ministre qui sert en protestant. Servir en protestant prouve que la position n’est pas intolérable. Je prétends que la position créée par le Gouvernement est devenue intolérable et qu’il ne reste par conséquent rien d’autre à faire pour qui se respecte que la Non-Coopération, c’est-à-dire une abstention totale. Le Général Botha refusa de faire partie du Conseil de Lord Milner p
U||arce qu’il désapprouvait l’attitude de celui-ci dans ses rapports avec les Boers. Et le Général Botha réussit parce qu’il avait pour lui le Transvaal presque entier. Au point de vue politique le succès dépend de la façon dont le pays accepte le mouvement de boycottage. Au point de vue religieux, le succès est obtenu par l’individu dès que celui-ci agit selon ses principes, et son action assure le succès national parce qu’il en a posé les bases en montrant quel était le chemin le plus direct pour y arriver.
U||L’autre argument est que nous réussirons en faisant partie des nouveaux conseils parce qu’en somme nous n’avons pas si mal réussi déjà lorsqu’il nous est arrivé de faire partie de corps moins populaires. La réponse à cette objection c’est que la ligne de séparation n’existait pas encore: nous n’avions pas perdu 94 confiance dans la loyauté et la justice britanniques, et peut-être qu’alors nous ne nous sentions pas assez forts pour mener à bien le boycottage, ou que nous n’en avions pas élaboré les méthodes comme nous l’avons fait depuis. Il est probable que ces trois raisons agissent aujourd’hui. Après tout, les façons de faire et les méthodes varient selon les temps. Il nous faut vieillir avec les années. La nourriture qui pouvait nous suffire lorsque nous étions enfants ne nous convient plus lorsque nous avons atteint l’âge d’homme.
U||14 juillet 1920.
U||LE PREMIER AOUT
U||Il est peu probable que les ministres de Sa Majesté promettent avant le 1er août de réviser les conditions de paix, et que par conséquent l’inauguration de la Non-Coopération soit suspendue. Le 1er août prochain sera aussi important dans l’histoire de l’Inde que le 6 avril l’an dernier. Le 6 avril fut le commencement de la fin de l’Acte Rowlatt. Personne ne peut s’imaginer que l’Acte Rowlatt puisse survivre devant l’agitation qui a été suspendue mais non abandonnée. Il doit être évident pour tous que la force qui arrachera la justice à un gouvernement récalcitrant est 95 celle qui fera abroger la loi Rowlatt, et c’est la force du Satyâgraha, qu’on l’appelle Désobéissance civile ou Non-Coopération.
U||Un grand nombre de gens appréhendent la venue de la Non-Coopération à cause des événements qui se sont produits l’an passé. Ils craignent la fureur de la foule et la répétition des représailles qui en furent la conséquence et dont il n’y a guère d’exemple plus atroce dans l’histoire des temps modernes. Personnellement je crains moins la fureur du gouvernement que la fureur de la populace déchaînée. Celle-ci est un signe de folie nationale et par conséquent bien plus difficile à maîtriser que la première, limitée à un groupe restreint. Il est plus facile de renverser un gouvernement qui s’est montré incapable de gouverner que de guérir, dans une foule, des inconnus de leur folie. Mais de grands mouvements ne peuvent être arrêtés parce qu’un gouvernement ou un peuple, ou tous les deux perdent la tête. Nous apprenons et profitons par nos fautes et par nos erreurs. Aucun général, digne de ce nom, ne renonce à la bataille parce qu’il a subi des revers ou, ce qui revient 
U||au même, parce qu’il s’est trompé. Il nous faut donc entreprendre la Non-Coopération avec confiance et avec espoir. Comme par le passé, nous en marquerons le début par le jeûne et par la prière, indiquant ainsi le caractère religieux de la démonstration. Les affaires devront cesser ce jour là, des réunions auront lieu pour réclamer la révision des conditions de Paix et la justice pour le Pendjab et pour faire comprendre l’importance de la Non-Coopération jusqu’à ce que justice ait été obtenue. L’abandon des titres et des postes honorifiques commencera également 96 en ce jour. On a exprimé, à ce propos, la crainte que l’avis en ait été donné dans un délai insuffisant. Cette crainte se dissipe aisément si l’on considère que le 1er août marque le début de la Non-Coopération. Ce n’est pas le seul jour où l’abandon de titres et de postes honorifiques peut avoir lieu. A dire vrai, je ne m’attends pas à ce qu’on réponde beaucoup à cet appel dès le premier jour
U||. Une propagande vigoureuse sera nécessaire: chaque possesseur de titres devra être prévenu en personne et toutes les raisons pour lesquelles l’abandon demandé est un devoir devront lui être démontrées.
U||Mais le plus important dans cette campagne de Non-Coopération est de développer l’ordre, la discipline, la coopération parmi le peuple, la coordination parmi les travailleurs pour la cause. Une Non-Coopération pour être efficace dépend d’une organisation parfaite. Les milliers d’hommes qui se pressaient aux réunions dans le Pendjab m’ont convaincu que le peuple désire retirer sa coopération au gouvernement mais qu’il ne sait comment s’y prendre. La plupart ignorent comment fonctionnent les rouages compliqués de la machine gouvernementale. Ils ne se rendent pas compte que tout citoyen soutient silencieusement, mais non moins sûrement, le gouvernement du jour. Tout citoyen est donc par cela même responsable de chaque acte du gouvernement. Et il est absolument juste de sa part de le soutenir tant que les actions du gouvernement sont supportables. Mais quand celles-ci font du tort à lui-même et à la nation, il est de son devoir de lui retirer son appui.
U||Ainsi que je l’ai déjà dit, tous les citoyens ne savent 97 pas agir d’une façon ordonnée. Le désordre est causé par la colère, l’ordre par une résistance intelligente. La première condition d’un succès véritable est par conséquent de s’assurer d’une absence totale de violence. La violence envers ceux qui représentent le gouvernement ou envers ceux qui ne se joignent pas à nous, c’est-à-dire qui soutiennent le gouvernement, représente un recul de notre cause, l’arrêt de la Non Coopération et le sacrifice inutile de vies innocentes. Ceux qui désirent voir la Non-Coopération réussir au plus vite se rappelleront que leur principal devoir est de veiller à ce qu’un ordre parfait règne autour d’eux.

U||LA NON-COOPÉRATION
U||Lettre adressée au Vice-Roi par M. Gandhi pour inaugurer la non-coopération.
U||«Je ne vous renvoie pas sans un serrement de cœur la médaille d’or Kaisar-i-Hind que votre prédécesseur m’avait offerte pour l’œuvre humanitaire accomplie par moi dans l’Afrique du Sud, la médaille de la guerre des Zoulous qui m’avait été remise en 1906 pour mes services comme officier responsable 98 d’une ambulance de volontaires indiens, la médaille de la guerre des Boers pour les services que j’ai rendus pendant la guerre Sud-Africaine comme aide-surveillant d’un corps de brancardiers volontaires Indiens. Je me permets de vous renvoyer ces décorations conformément à un plan de Non-Coopération que nous inaugurons aujourd’hui et qui est lié au mouvement pour le Califat. Quelques précieuses que m’aient été ces distinctions, je ne puis continuer à les porter sans remords tant que mes compatriotes musulmans ont à souffrir d’un tort fait à leurs croyances religieuses. Certains événements qui se sont produits le mois dernier m’ont convaincu toujours davantage que, d
U||ans l’affaire du Califat, le Gouvernement Impérial s’est comporté d’une manière peu scrupuleuse, injuste et immorale et que pour défendre cette immoralité il a accumulé les torts. Je ne puis conserver pour un tel gouvernement ni respect, ni affection.
U||L’attitude du Gouvernement Impérial et celui de Votre Excellence au sujet de la question du Pendjab m’ont donné d’autres sujets de mécontentement. J’ai eu l’honneur, comme Votre Excellence le sait, de faire partie de la Commission du Congrès chargée de rechercher les causes des désordres du Pendjab au mois d’Avril 1919 et j’ai la ferme conviction que Sir Michael O’Dwyer était absolument incapable de remplir les fonctions de Gouverneur-Adjoint du Pendjab, et que sa politique fut la cause principale de la fureur de la foule, à Amritsar. Sans doute les excès commis par celle-ci sont impardonnables; les tentatives d’incendie, le meurtre de cinq Anglais innocents et le lâche attentat contre Miss Sherwood furent des incidents déplorables et gratuits. Mais les mesures 99 de répression prises par le Général Dyer, par le Colonel Frank Johnson, le Colonel O’Brien, Mr Bosworth Smith, Rai Shri Ram Sud, Mr Mallik Khan et autres officiers n’étaient pas proportionnées aux crimes commis
U|| par le peuple et atteignirent une cruauté aveugle et une barbarie sans pareille dans l’histoire moderne. La légèreté avec laquelle votre Excellence a traité le crime officiel, la façon dont elle a exonéré Sir Michael O’Dwyer, le rappel de M. Montagu et par dessus tout la honteuse ignorance des événements du Pendjab et la froide indifférence pour les sentiments des Indiens montrées à la Chambre des Lords m’ont rempli des plus sérieuses craintes pour l’avenir de l’Empire, m’ont complètement éloigné du gouvernement actuel et me rendent absolument incapable de continuer à lui offrir comme je l’ai fait jusqu’ici ma coopération loyale.
U||A mon humble avis, la méthode habituelle qui consiste à faire de l’agitation au moyen de pétitions et de députations, etc., est un remède impuissant pour amener au repentir un gouvernement à ce point indifférent au bien de ceux dont il est responsable. Dans les pays d’Europe le peuple aurait fait une révolution sanglante pour effacer des injustices aussi sérieuses que celles du Pendjab et du Califat. Il aurait résisté de toute sa force contre semblable émasculation nationale impliquée par la dite injustice. Mais, la moitié de l’Inde est trop faible pour résister avec violence et l’autre ne le veut pas. Je me risque donc à suggérer le remède de la Non-Coopération qui permet à ceux qui le désirent de rompre avec le gouvernement, et qui, s’il ne s’accompagne pas de violence et s’accomplit avec méthode, doit l’obliger à faire un retour 100 sur lui-même et à réparer le mal commis. Mais tout en poursuivant cette politique de Non-Coopération aussi loin que je pourrai entra
U||îner le peuple, je ne perds pas l’espoir que vous voyiez la possibilité d’agir avec équité. Je prie donc respectueusement Votre Excellence de réunir en conférence les chefs reconnus du peuple et de chercher avec eux le moyen d’apaiser les Musulmans et de réparer l’iniquité commise envers le malheureux Pendjab.»
U||4 août 1920
U||LE CONGRÈS ET LA NON-COOPÉRATION
U||L’honorable Pundit Malaviyaji, pour qui j’ai la plus haute considération, et que j’ai souvent appelé du nom de Dharmatma (âme sainte) s’est adressé à moi, à la fois publiquement et en particulier, pour me demander de suspendre la Non-Coopération jusqu’à ce que le Congrès ait exprimé son opinion. Le Mahratta a été du même avis. Ces demandes m’ont fait réfléchir mais je regrette de dire que je n’ai pu en tenir compte. Je ferais et donnerais beaucoup pour plaire au Punditji. Je désire infiniment recevoir son approbation et sa bénédiction pour toutes mes actions. Mais un devoir plus haut m’oblige à ne pas me détourner du plan adopté par le Comité de 101 Non-Coopération. Il est certains moments dans la vie où il faut agir, même s’il est impossible d’entraîner avec soi ses meilleurs amis. Lorsqu’il y a conflit de devoirs la «petite voix silencieuse» doit être l’arbitre final.
U||La raison pour laquelle on me demande de suspendre l’action de la Non-Coopération, c’est que le Congrès doit se réunir prochainement, qu’il considérera toute la question de la Non-Coopération et qu’il statuera. «Il vaudrait donc mieux», dit Punditji «attendre la décision du Congrès.» A mon humble avis le devoir d’un membre du Congrès n’est nullement de consulter celui-ci avant d’agir, lorsqu’il n’a aucun doute sur la question. Sinon, ce serait l’inertie.
U||Le Congrès est en somme le porte-parole de la nation. Lorsqu’on a une politique ou un programme que l’on aimerait voir adopter, mais pour lequel on désire cultiver l’opinion publique, on s’adresse naturellement au Congrès pour qu’il le discute et forme une opinion. Mais lorsque l’on possède une foi inébranlable dans une certaine action ou dans une politique particulière, attendre que le Congrès se prononce serait folie. Il faut au contraire agir et en démontrer l’efficacité afin de décider la nation à l’adopter.
U||Ma fidélité au Congrès m’ordonne de suivre sa politique si celle-ci n’est pas contraire à ma conscience. Si je fais partie d’une minorité je n’ai pas le droit de poursuivre ma politique au nom du Congrès. La décision du Congrès sur une question donnée ne veut pas dire qu’il soit interdit à un membre du Congrès d’accomplir une action opposée, mais qu’en ce faisant il agit à ses risques et périls et sachant qu’il n’est pas soutenu par le Congrès.
U||102
U||Tout membre du Congrès, tout corps public a le droit et parfois même le devoir d’exprimer son opinion personnelle, d’agir d’après elle et de devancer ainsi le verdict du Congrès. C’est même la meilleure façon de servir la nation. En inaugurant une politique mûrement réfléchie nous fournissons à un grand corps délibérant comme le Congrès, les moyens de se faire une opinion bien informée. Le Congrès ne peut exprimer une opinion nationale quelque peu précise à moins que certains d’entre nous ne possédions des idées nettes sur un plan d’action particulier. Si tous nous tenions en suspens notre opinion, le Congrès se verrait également forcé de faire de même.
U||Dans toute institution il existe trois classes de gens. Ceux dont les vues sont favorables à une politique donnée, ceux dont les vues sont bien définies mais défavorables et ceux qui n’ont pas de vues bien définies. Pour ce dernier et nombreux groupe c’est le Congrès qui décide. Je suis certain que si nous voulons arriver à faire quelque chose des Réformes, il nous faudra créer une atmosphère pure, saine, élevée au lieu de l’atmosphère malsaine, fétide et avilissante qui existe actuellement. Je considère que notre premier devoir est d’obtenir justice du Gouvernement Impérial pour le Califat et le Pendjab. Dans ces deux questions l’injustice se maintient par les mensonges et l’insolence. Je considère donc qu’il est du devoir de la Nation de débarrasser le Gouvernement de cette souillure avant de pouvoir coopérer avec lui. Même l’opposition ou l’obstruction est possible lorsqu’il y a respect et confiance réciproques. A l’heure présente, l’autorité qui gouverne n
U||a aucun 103 respect ni pour nous ni pour nos sentiments. Nous n’avons pas foi en elle. La Coopération dans de telles circonstances devient un crime. Je ne puis, avec des vues aussi absolues que les miennes, servir le Congrès et le pays autrement qu’en les mettant en pratique et en fournissant ainsi au Congrès de quoi former sa propre opinion.
U||Suspendre la Non-Coopération serait pour moi manquer de parole à mes frères musulmans. Ils ont un devoir religieux à remplir. Leur sentiment religieux a été profondément blessé par un mépris total des lois de la justice et des promesses des ministres britanniques. Il faut maintenant que les Musulmans agissent. Ils ne peuvent attendre que le Congrès prenne une décision. Ils peuvent seulement espérer que le Congrès ratifiera leur action et partagera leur tristesse et leur fardeau. Leur action ne saurait être remise jusqu’à ce que le Congrès ait décidé une politique, pas plus que leur plan d’action ne saurait être modifié par une décision contraire de sa part, à moins qu’il ne soit démontré que cette action serait une faute. Le Califat est pour eux une question de conscience, et dans les questions de conscience, la loi de la Majorité n’existe pas.
U||4 août 1920.
U||104
U||LA DOCTRINE DE L’ÉPÉE
U||Il est à peu près impossible, à notre époque où la force brutale est maîtresse, d’imaginer que personne puisse rejeter la loi de suprématie de la force brutale. Aussi je reçois des lettres anonymes me conseillant de ne pas entraver la marche de la Non-Coopération même s’il arrivait que la violence populaire éclatât. Certains viennent me trouver, et présumant qu’en secret je dois préparer une action violente, me demandent quand viendra l’heureux moment de déclarer ouvertement la violence. Ils m’assurent que les Anglais ne plieront jamais que devant la violence ouverte ou secrète. Il en est d’autres encore qui me croient, paraît-il, le plus grand scélérat de l’Inde parce que je ne dis jamais quelle est mon intention véritable[67] et ils n’ont pas l’ombre 105 d’un doute que je crois à la violence autant que la plupart.
U||Puisque la doctrine de l’épée a pour la majorité de 106 l’humanité une telle importance, que le succès de la Non-Coopération dépend avant tout de l’absence de violence pendant la durée du mouvement et que ma manière de voir à ce sujet affecte la conduite d’un grand nombre de gens, je tiens à l’expliquer aussi clairement que possible.
U||Je crois en vérité que s’il fallait absolument faire un choix entre la lâcheté et la violence, je conseillerais la violence. Par exemple, lorsque mon fils aîné m’a demandé ce qu’il aurait dû faire s’il avait été avec moi en 1908, quand je fus victime d’un attentat, si son devoir eût été de fuir et de me laisser tuer ou d’employer la force pour me défendre, je lui ai répondu que son devoir aurait été de me défendre, même s’il lui avait fallu employer la violence. C’est pourquoi je suis d’avis que ceux qui croient à la violence apprennent le maniement des armes. Je préférerais assurément que l’Inde eût recours aux armes pour défendre son honneur plutôt que de la voir devenir ou rester lâchement l’impuissant témoin de son déshonneur.
U||Mais je crois que la non-violence est infiniment supérieure à la violence: pardonner est plus viril que punir. Le pardon est la parure du soldat. Mais s’abstenir n’est pardonner que s’il y a possibilité de punir; l’abstention n’a aucun sens si elle provient de l’impuissance. On ne peut guère dire que la souris pardonne au chat lorsqu’elle se laisse croquer par lui. Je comprends par conséquent le sentiment de ceux qui réclament le châtiment mérité par le général Dyer et par ses pareils. Ils le déchireraient s’ils le pouvaient. Mais je ne crois pas que l’Inde soit impuissante; je ne crois pas être moi-même une créature 107 impuissante; seulement je tiens à employer plus utilement les forces de la nation et les miennes.
U||Qu’on ne se méprenne pas sur mes paroles! La force ne dépend pas de la capacité physique; elle procède d’une volonté indomptable. Un Zoulou quelconque, si l’on ne considère que sa force corporelle, est un adversaire plus que redoutable pour un Anglais ordinaire. Et pourtant le Zoulou s’enfuit devant un jeune Anglais parce qu’il a peur de son revolver ou de ceux qui s’en serviraient pour lui. Il craint la mort et malgré son corps vigoureux il manque de nerfs. Nous qui habitons l’Inde, nous pouvons en un moment nous rendre compte qu’il est inutile à 100000 Anglais de chercher à effrayer 300 millions d’êtres humains. Un pardon net serait la reconnaissance nette de notre force. Un pardon éclairé ferait monter en nous une vague formidable de force qui rendrait impossible à un Dyer ou à un Johnson d’accumuler des outrages sur notre malheureux pays... L’Inde aura tout avantage à renoncer au droit qu’elle a de punir. Nous avons de meilleures choses à faire, une mission plus no
U||ble à prêcher au monde.
U||Je ne suis pas un visionnaire. Je prétends être un idéaliste pratique. Le culte de la Non-violence n’est pas uniquement pour les Rishis (sages) et les saints. Il est aussi pour le vulgaire. La Non-Violence est la loi de l’espèce humaine comme la violence est celle de la brute. L’esprit sommeille chez la brute et celle-ci ne connaît d’autre loi que la force physique. La dignité de l’homme réclame de lui l’obéissance à une loi supérieure,—à la puissance de l’esprit.
U||Je me suis donc permis de présenter à l’Inde l’antique loi du sacrifice de soi. Car le Satyâgraha et ses 108 rejetons: la non-coopération et la résistance civile, ne sont que des noms nouveaux pour la loi de Souffrance. Les Rishis qui découvrirent la loi de la Non-Violence au milieu de la violence furent de plus grands génies que Newton. Ils furent de plus grands guerriers que Wellington. S’étant eux-mêmes servi d’armes ils en avaient compris l’inutilité et enseignèrent à un monde fatigué que le salut ne se trouvait pas dans la violence mais dans la Non-Violence.
U||La Non-violence sous sa forme dynamique veut dire souffrance consciente. Ceci ne veut point dire que nous devions nous soumettre humblement à la volonté de celui qui fait le mal mais que notre âme entière doit résister à la volonté du tyran. Un seul individu qui agit selon cette loi fondamentale peut défier la puissance entière d’un empire injuste pour sauver son honneur, sa religion, son âme et amener plus tard la chute de cet empire ou sa régénération.
U||Ainsi je ne demande pas à l’Inde de pratiquer la Non-violence à cause de sa faiblesse. Je veux qu’elle pratique la Non-violence étant consciente de sa force et de son pouvoir. L’Inde n’a pas besoin d’apprendre à manier les armes pour se rendre compte de sa force. Nous paraissons en avoir besoin parce que nous paraissons croire que nous ne sommes qu’une masse de chair. Je veux que l’Inde reconnaisse qu’elle possède une âme qui ne saurait périr et peut triompher de toutes les faiblesses matérielles et tenir tête à toute la coalition matérielle du monde entier... Mais comme je suis un homme pratique je n’attends pas que l’Inde ait reconnu la possibilité pratique de la vie spirituelle dans le domaine politique. L’Inde se considère impuissante et paralysée devant 109 les canons, les tanks et les aéroplanes des Anglais; et elle adopte la Non-Coopération parce qu’elle se sent faible. Cela servira cependant au même but si un nombre suffisant met en pratique cette méthode: l
U||Inde sera délivrée du poids écrasant de l’Injustice Britannique.
U||Je distingue cette Non-Coopération du Sinn-Feinisme car elle est conçue de telle sorte qu’elle ne saurait être menée de front avec la violence. Mais j’invite même l’école de la violence à faire l’essai de cette Non-Coopération pacifique. Elle n’échouera pas à cause de faiblesse inhérente, mais parce qu’elle n’aura pas éveillé assez d’ardeur en réponse. Alors viendra le moment du danger véritable. Les hommes d’âme élevée, qui ne pourront endurer davantage l’humiliation nationale, donneront libre cours à leurs sentiments de colère. Ils adopteront la violence. Si je ne me trompe, ils périront sans s’être délivrés et sans avoir délivré leur pays de l’injustice. En adoptant la doctrine de l’épée, il est possible que l’Inde remporte une victoire momentanée. L’Inde cessera d’être alors ce dont mon cœur est fier. Je suis marié à l’Inde parce que je lui dois tout. J’ai l’absolue croyance qu’elle a une mission à remplir dans le monde. Elle ne do
U||it pas copier aveuglément l’Europe. Si l’Inde accepte la doctrine de l’épée, ce sera pour moi l’heure de l’épreuve. J’espère que moi je ne faillirai pas. Ma religion ne connaît pas de frontières géographiques. Si ma foi est vivante, elle dépassera mon amour pour l’Inde même. J’ai voué ma vie au service de l’Inde par la religion de la Non-Violence que je crois être la racine même de l’Hindouisme.
U||110
U||En attendant je supplie ceux qui doutent de moi de ne pas troubler la marche paisible de la lutte qui vient de commencer, par l’incitation à la violence, en s’imaginant que je la désire. Je hais le secret comme un crime. Qu’ils tentent l’épreuve de la Non-Coopération et ils verront que je n’en ai pas fait la moindre restriction mentale.
U||11 août 1920.
U||PROGRAMME DE NON-COOPÉRATION
U||Première phase.
U||Le Comité de Non-Coopération a inclus, dans la première phase du programme de Non-Coopération, le boycottage des tribunaux par les magistrats et des écoles et collèges universitaires de l’Etat par les parents ou les étudiants. Je sais que seule ma réputation de travailleur et de combattant m’a empêché d’être accusé ouvertement de démence pour avoir conseillé le boycottage des tribunaux et des écoles.
U||J’ose prétendre cependant qu’il y a quelque méthode dans ma folie. Il n’est pas nécessaire de beaucoup réfléchir pour se rendre compte que par les Tribunaux un gouvernement établit son autorité, et 111 que par ses écoles qu’il forme les employés et autres fonctionnaires. Ce sont deux institutions saines lorsque le gouvernement qui en a la responsabilité est relativement juste. Mais lorsque le gouvernement est injuste, elles deviennent des pièges mortels.
U||En ce qui concerne les magistrats, aucun journal n’a attaqué ma manière de voir sur la Non-Coopération avec autant d’opiniâtreté que le Leader d’Allahabad. Il a tourné en dérision l’opinion que j’ai exprimée sur les magistrats dans le petit livre Le Home Rule Indien, écrit par moi en 1918. Mes opinions n’ont point changé et si j’en trouve le temps j’espère les développer dans ces colonnes. Je m’en abstiens pour l’instant, mes vues personnelles n’ayant rien à voir avec le conseil que j’ai donné aux magistrats de suspendre leurs fonctions. Je propose que la Non-Coopération leur demande d’abandonner leur charge. Personne peut-être ne coopère autant qu’eux avec le Gouvernement, par l’intermédiaire des Tribunaux. Ils interprètent la loi auprès du peuple et soutiennent ainsi l’autorité... On prétend que ce sont les magistrats qui ont lutté contre le gouvernement avec le plus d’énergie. Il est possible que ce soit vrai en partie, mais cela ne répare pas le 
U||mal qu’ils font et qui est inhérent à leur profession. Et par conséquent, lorsque la nation cherche à paralyser le gouvernement, il faut que cette profession cesse d’exercer. Mais, disent les critiques, le gouvernement sera enchanté de voir les avocats et les plaideurs tomber dans le piège que je leur tends. Je ne le crois pas. Ce qui peut être vrai en temps ordinaire ne l’est pas en temps extraordinaire. En temps normal le gouvernement peut s’irriter 112 contre les magistrats qui blâment vigoureusement ses méthodes et ses manières de faire, mais en face d’une action vigoureuse, il ne tiendra pas à perdre l’appui que lui donne, par l’exercice de sa profession au tribunal, un seul de ses magistrats.
U||En outre, dans mon plan d’action, suspendre ses fonctions ne veut pas dire rester dans l’inertie. Les magistrats ne doivent pas se retirer pour prendre du repos. Il leur faudra persuader à leurs clients de boycotter les tribunaux. Ils improviseront des cours d’arbitrage pour régler les différends. Une nation qui veut forcer à la justice un gouvernement qui s’y refuse n’a guère le temps d’avoir des querelles individuelles. Les avocats devront le faire comprendre à leurs clients. Nos lecteurs ignorent probablement que pendant la guerre récente les magistrats les plus célèbres de l’Angleterre suspendirent leurs fonctions. Ceux qui abandonnèrent pour un temps leur profession consacrèrent leur journée entière au travail, au lieu de ne travailler que pendant leurs heures de loisir. La vraie politique n’est pas un jeu. Feu M. Gokhale déplorait que nous ne fussions pas arrivés à traiter la politique comme autre chose qu’un passe-temps. Nous n’imaginons point ce que notre pays a pe
U||rdu pour avoir laissé des amateurs mener la bataille contre une bureaucratie entraînée, sérieuse et travailleuse.
U||Les critiques disent ensuite que les magistrats mourront de faim s’ils abandonnent leur profession. Ceci ne saurait être le cas pour les Sinhas[68] de la 113 profession. De temps à autre ils cessent leur travail pour visiter l’Europe ou pour d’autres raisons. A ceux qui gagnent juste de quoi vivre, s’ils sont des hommes de bonne foi, chaque Comité Local du Califat pourra remettre des honoraires en échange de leur travail.
U|| 
U||Maintenant quant aux Ecoles, je considère que si nous n’avons pas le courage d’interrompre l’instruction de nos enfants nous ne méritons pas de vaincre.
U||La première phase comprend l’abandon des titres et des distinctions. A dire vrai un gouvernement n’accorde pas de distinctions sans exiger plus que ces distinctions ne valent. Celui qui les gaspillerait serait bien mauvais ou bien extravagant. Sous un gouvernement qui dépend en grande partie de la volonté du peuple nous donnons notre existence pour recevoir un colifichet en symbole de nos services. Sous un gouvernement injuste qui brave la volonté du peuple, les riches Jagirs deviennent un signe de servitude et de déshonneur. Si on les considère ainsi, les écoles doivent être abandonnées sans un moment d’hésitation.
U||Pour moi, le plan tout entier de la Non-Coopération permet entre autres choses de juger de l’intensité, et de l’étendue de nos sentiments. Sommes-nous disposés à souffrir? On a dit qu’il ne fallait pas s’attendre à ce que les possesseurs de titres répondent facilement à notre appel, parce qu’ils ne se sont jamais occupés des affaires nationales et que leurs distinctions ont été acquises trop chèrement pour les sacrifier ainsi. Je laisse l’argument à ceux qui l’emploient et j’ajoute: Et les parents des enfants? et les étudiants? 114 Eux n’ont aucun rapport intime avec le gouvernement. Sentent-ils ou ne sentent-ils pas assez profondément pour sacrifier leurs études? Je prétends d’ailleurs qu’il n’y a pas de sacrifice à boycotter les écoles. Nous sommes inaptes à non-coopérer si nous ne sommes même pas capables d’organiser notre éducation d’une façon absolument indépendante du gouvernement. Chaque village devrait se charger d’organiser l’éducation de ses
U|| enfants. Je ne voudrais pas dépendre de l’aide du gouvernement. Si le réveil est véritable, il n’y aura pas lieu d’interrompre les études de la jeunesse un seul jour. Les maîtres qui dirigent actuellement les écoles du gouvernement, s’ils ont assez de caractère pour démissionner, pourront organiser les écoles nationales et enseigner à nos enfants les choses dont ils ont besoin et ne pas faire de la majorité d’entre eux des commis quelconques. Je compte sur Aligarh College pour donner l’exemple. L’effet moral produit en vidant nos Madrassas sera immense. Je suis persuadé que les parents et les étudiants hindous suivront l’exemple de leurs frères musulmans.
U||En vérité quelle plus noble éducation que de voir parents et étudiants placer leurs sentiments religieux au-dessus de la connaissance des belles-lettres. S’il était impossible d’organiser immédiatement l’enseignement littéraire des jeunes gens que l’on ferait sortir des écoles, ce leur serait un excellent entraînement de travailler comme volontaires pour la cause qui leur a fait quitter les écoles du gouvernement. Selon moi il en est pour la jeunesse comme pour les magistrats; se retirer ne veut pas dire mener une existence indolente; les jeunes gens qui quitteront 115 leurs écoles devront chacun selon ses aptitudes, prendre part à l’agitation.

U||SOURCES RELIGIEUSES A L’APPUI DE LA NON-COOPÉRATION
U||Ce n’est pas sans la plus grande répugnance que j’engage une controverse avec un chef aussi érudit que Sir Narayan Chandavarkar. Mais comme auteur du mouvement de Non-Coopération le pénible devoir m’incombe d’exprimer mon opinion, même si elle est absolument opposée à celle des chefs que je respecte. Sir Narayan et moi semblons nous placer à différents points de vue lorsque nous lisons la Bible, la Gita et le Koran, ou tout au moins semblons les interpréter différemment. Il semble que nous donnions aux mots Ahimsa (Non-Tuer), en politique et en religion, un sens différent. Je vais essayer d’exprimer clairement ce que j’entends par ces termes courants et comment je comprends les différentes religions.
U||Je puis tout d’abord assurer à Sir Narayan que mon opinion n’a pas changé au sujet d’Ahimsa. Je crois toujours que l’homme, n’ayant pas reçu le pouvoir de créer, n’a pas le droit de détruire même la 116 plus infime créature. La prérogative de détruire appartient uniquement au Créateur de tout ce qui vit. J’accepte l’interprétation de Ahimsa, à savoir que ce n’est pas seulement un état négatif consistant à ne pas faire de mal, mais un état positif, consistant à aimer, faire le bien, même à celui qui fait le mal. Mais cela ne veut pas dire aider celui qui fait le mal à continuer à commettre l’injustice ou le tolérer par notre consentement passif. Au contraire l’amour, l’état actif d’Ahimsa demande que l’on résiste à celui qui fait le mal en se séparant de lui-même, s’il doit en être offensé ou blessé physiquement. Par exemple si mon fils mène une existence dissolue, je ne dois pas l’y encourager en continuant à subvenir à ses besoins, mon amour p
U||our lui m’oblige au contraire à lui retirer mon aide, même s’il doit en mourir, et le même amour m’impose l’obligation de lui ouvrir les bras quand il se repent. Mais je n’ai pas le droit de l’obliger à s’amender en employant la force brutale. Telle est selon moi la morale de l’histoire de l’Enfant Prodigue.
U||La Non-Coopération n’est pas un état passif, c’est un état intensément actif plus actif que la résistance physique ou la violence. Le terme: résistance passive, est une erreur. La Non-Coopération, dans le sens où je l’emploie, doit être non-violente et par conséquent ne punit pas, n’est pas vindicative et n’a pour base ni mauvais vouloir, ni haine. Il s’ensuit donc que ce serait de ma part un péché de servir le Général Dyer et de coopérer avec lui pour tirer sur des innocents; mais ce serait de ma part faire œuvre de pardon et d’amour que de le soigner et de lui sauver la vie s’il était dangereusement malade. Je 117 ne puis employer ici le mot coopération comme Sir Narayan le ferait probablement. Je coopérerais mille fois avec le gouvernement actuel pour lui faire abandonner sa carrière criminelle, mais je n’entends pas coopérer un seul instant avec lui pour l’y encourager. Et je serais coupable d’une mauvaise action si je conservais un titre reçu de lui, une fonct
U||ion dépendant de lui, ou si je soutenais ses tribunaux et ses écoles. Je préfère infiniment l’écuelle du mendiant aux plus riches biens offerts par ceux dont les mains sont encore souillées du sang versé au Jallianwala Bagh. Je préfère un mandat d’arrêt aux paroles mielleuses de ceux qui ont blessé les sentiments religieux de soixante-dix millions de mes frères musulmans.
U||Mon interprétation de la Gita est diamétralement opposée à celle de Sir Narayan. Je ne puis croire que la Gita enseigne la violence pour faire le bien. C’est avant tout une description du duel qui a lieu dans notre propre cœur. L’auteur divin s’est servi d’un événement historique pour inculquer cette leçon qu’il faut faire notre devoir au péril même de notre existence. Il inculque l’accomplissement de notre devoir, quelles qu’en puissent être les conséquences, car nous autres mortels, entravés par notre corps, ne pouvons contrôler que nos propres actions. La Gita distingue entre la puissance de la lumière et la puissance des ténèbres et démontre leur incompatibilité.
U||Jésus, selon mon humble opinion, était le prince des politiques. Il rendait à César ce qui appartenait à César. Il donnait au diable ce qui lui était dû. Il ne cessa de le fuir et il est dit que pas une seule fois il ne succomba à ses incantations. La politique de son 118 temps consistait à chercher le bien du peuple en lui enseignant à ne pas se laisser séduire par le faux clinquant des prêtres et des pharisiens. Ces derniers dirigeaient et modelaient alors l’existence du peuple. De nos jours, le Gouvernement touche à chaque circonstance de notre vie. Il menace notre existence même. Il va de soi que si nous voulons préserver le bien de la nation il faut nous intéresser religieusement aux actes de ceux qui gouvernent, exercer sur eux une influence morale et insister pour qu’ils obéissent aux lois de la morale. Le général Dyer par son acte de sauvagerie a produit certainement un «effet moral». Ceux qui ont pour tâche de faire avancer le mouvement de Non-Coopération espèrent produi
U||re un effet moral par l’abnégation, le sacrifice et la purification de soi-même...
U||25 août 1920.
U||CARACTÈRE INTIME DE LA NON-COOPÉRATION
U||... Le mouvement de Non-Coopération n’est ni anti-Chrétien, ni anti-Anglais, ni anti-Européen. C’est une lutte entre la religion et l’irréligion, entre la puissance de la lumière et la puissance des ténèbres.
U||Je suis convaincu qu’aujourd’hui l’Europe ne 119 représente pas l’esprit de Dieu ni le Christianisme, mais l’esprit de Satan. Et les succès de celui-ci sont d’autant plus grands qu’il se montre avec le nom de Dieu sur les lèvres. L’Europe d’aujourd’hui n’est chrétienne que de nom. En réalité elle a le culte de Mammon. «Il est plus facile à un chameau de passer par le trou d’une aiguille qu’à un homme riche d’entrer dans le royaume de Dieu» disait Jésus-Christ. Ses soi-disant disciples évaluent leur progrès moral d’après leurs possessions terrestres. L’hymne national de l’Angleterre même est anti-Chrétien. Jésus qui demandait à ses disciples d’aimer leurs ennemis comme eux-mêmes n’aurait pu chanter: «Confondez mes ennemis, déjouez leur fourberie». Dans son dernier livre le Dr Wallace a exposé sa certitude absolue que le progrès tant vanté de la science n’a pas ajouté un pouce de grandeur morale à l’Europe. La guerre a démontré, comme rien 
U||ne l’avait fait jusqu’alors, le caractère satanique de la civilisation qui domine l’Europe de nos jours. Toutes les règles de la morale publique ont été violées par les vainqueurs au nom de la vertu. Aucun mensonge n’a été considéré comme trop abject pour être prononcé. Le motif qui se cache derrière chaque crime n’est ni religieux ni spirituel mais grossièrement matériel. Les Musulmans et les Hindous qui luttent contre le gouvernement sont guidés par la religion et par l’honneur. Même l’assassinat cruel qui vient de révolter le pays, avait paraît-il, un motif religieux[69]. Il est certainement nécessaire de débarrasser la 120 religion de ses excroissances malignes mais il est nécessaire également d’exposer le vide des prétentions morales de ceux qui préfèrent la fortune matérielle au gain moral. Il est plus facile de tirer de son erreur un fanatique ignorant qu’un scélérat fieffé de sa scélératesse.
U||Toutefois cette accusation n’est pas formulée contre les individus ou même contre des nations. Des milliers d’Européens sont individuellement supérieurs à leur entourage. Je parle des tendances de l’Europe telles qu’elles se reflètent chez les chefs actuels. L’Angleterre par l’intermédiaire de ses gouvernants écrase insolemment sous son talon le sentiment religieux et national de l’Inde. L’Angleterre, sous le faux prétexte de laisser les peuples disposer d’eux-mêmes, cherche à exploiter les mines de pétrole de la Mésopotamie qu’elle est sur le point de quitter, probablement parce qu’elle ne peut faire autrement. La France, par l’intermédiaire de ses chefs, prête son nom à l’instruction militaire des cannibales et manque honteusement à son devoir de puissance mandataire en cherchant à briser les Syriens. Le président Wilson a jeté au panier ses fameux quatorze points.
U||C’est la coalition de ces forces mauvaises que l’Inde combat par sa Non-Coopération non-violente et ceux-là... qui sentent la nécessité de détrôner cette erreur, même s’ils sont Chrétiens ou Européens, peuvent avoir le privilège de le faire en prenant part au mouvement. A l’honneur de l’Islam est liée la sécurité de la religion même et à l’honneur de l’Inde l’honneur de toute nation faible.

U||DÉMOCRATIE CONTRE «MOBOCRATIE»[70]
U||A regarder superficiellement, la ligne de démarcation entre la loi du peuple et la loi de la populace est bien mince; et pourtant la division est complète et subsistera toujours. L’Inde passe rapidement par une phase où la populace fait la loi. J’emploie l’adverbe pour exprimer mon espérance. Nous aurons peut-être et pour notre malheur à procéder par lentes étapes mais nous ferons preuve de sagesse en adoptant tous les moyens à notre disposition pour traverser cette période le plus rapidement possible. Nous sommes trop portés à céder à la populace. C’était elle qui régnait à Amritsar le 10 avril 1919. Elle régnait aussi le même jour néfaste à Ahmedabad. Elle représenta la destruction sans discipline et par conséquent elle fut irréfléchie, inutile, nuisible et malfaisante. La guerre, destruction disciplinée, est beaucoup plus sanglante qu’aucune destruction commise par la foule... Par conséquent si l’Inde doit obtenir sa liberté par la violence il faudra que ce soit par
U|| la violence disciplinée et honorable (en tant qu’il est possible d’associer l’idée d’honneur et 122 de violence) à laquelle on donne le nom de guerre. Ce sera alors non l’action de la populace déchaînée mais de la démocratie.
U||Mais je n’ai pas l’intention de parler aujourd’hui du règne d’une populace comme celle d’Ahmedabad. J’ai l’intention de parler de celle qui m’est plus familière. Le Congrès est une manifestation de la populace et dans ce sens-là seulement. Bien qu’organisé par des hommes et des femmes réfléchis, on peut néanmoins lui donner ce nom. Nos démonstrations populaires sont certainement celles de la populace. Pendant mon voyage mémorable à travers le Pendjab, le Sindh et Madras j’ai eu une véritable indigestion de ces manifestations[71]. J’ai été honteux de 123 voir détruire d’une façon inconsidérée bien qu’inconsciente les bagages de voyageurs par des manifestants qui dans leur adoration pour leurs héros ignoraient l’existence de tout le reste: choses et gens. Ils ont fait des bruits discordants qui n’ont 124 point contribué au confort de leurs chefs. Ils se sont bousculés, ils se sont écrasés, ils ont poussé tous à la fois des clameurs au saint nom de la paix 
U||et de l’ordre. On a entendu dix volontaires donner en même temps le même ordre. Les volontaires deviennent souvent des manifestants au lieu de faire la police et de retenir les gens. C’est pour les chefs une tâche dangereuse et toujours désagréable de passer du quai de la gare à la voiture qui les attend entre deux haies interrompues de volontaires. Il faut parfois une heure pour ce qui devrait durer cinq minutes. La voiture est prise d’assaut par quiconque 125 ose le faire, et les volontaires sont souvent les plus grands coupables. Les chefs et autres occupants se voient obligés de parlementer pour qu’ils ne grimpent pas sur les marchepieds avec ce sans gêne. La capote de l’auto est malmenée, j’en ai rarement vu qui ne soit pas endommagée par la foule. Sur la route, au lieu de s’aligner, celle-ci suit la voiture; c’est le comble de la confusion. A tous moments on court le risque d’un accident. S’il en arrive rarement aux manifestations de ce genre, ce n’est point grâce à l
U||habileté de ceux qui les ont organisées mais à la bonne humeur de la foule décidée à supporter toutes les bousculades; et si chacun bouscule son voisin personne ne cherche à lui faire du mal. Pour terminer ce tableau, il y a le meeting, qui est une cause d’anxiété toujours croissante. En face de soi rien que du désordre, un bruit assourdissant, des hurlements et des cris. Mais un bon orateur retient l’attention de son auditoire et l’ordre est tel que l’on entendrait tomber une épingle.
U||Néanmoins c’est la populace qui est toute puissante. Vous êtes à sa merci. Tant qu’il existe entre elle et vous un courant de sympathie tout va bien. Que celui-ci s’interrompe et c’est la catastrophe. Un incident comme celui d’Ahmedabad laisse deviner de temps à autre la psychologie de la foule.
U||Notre pierre d’achoppement est d’avoir négligé la musique: la musique c’est le rythme, c’est l’ordre; l’effet en est électrique. Elle calme sur-le-champ. J’ai vu, en Europe, un inspecteur de police ingénieux, pour réprimer les tendances malfaisantes d’une foule, faire entonner un chant populaire. Malheureusement, comme nos Shastras, la musique est restée 126 le privilège de quelques-uns... la musique n’a jamais été nationalisée au sens où on l’entend à présent. Si j’avais quelque influence sur les volontaires, les Scouts et les membres des associations Seva Samiti j’obligerais à chanter correctement en chœur des hymnes nationaux. Et dans ce but je prierais les plus grands musiciens de venir à chaque Congrès et à chaque Conférence enseigner la musique aux masses.
U||Il faut exiger des volontaires une discipline beaucoup plus grande, plus de méthode, plus de savoir et ne pas accepter le premier venu qui se présente. Il gêne plus qu’il n’aide. Imaginez les conséquences qu’aurait sur une armée en guerre l’arrivée d’un soldat qui n’a pas été exercé; il pourrait la désorganiser en une seconde. Ma plus grande anxiété au sujet de la Non-Coopération n’est pas la lenteur avec laquelle y viennent les chefs, ni certainement les critiques bien ou mal intentionnées, ni en aucune façon la franche répression. Le mouvement triomphera de ces obstacles... La plus grande difficulté consiste en ce que nous ne sommes pas encore sortis de la période Mobocratique. Ma consolation c’est que rien n’est plus facile que de discipliner la foule pour la bonne raison qu’elle ne réfléchit pas, ne prémédite rien. Elle agit comme dans un délire.
U||Elle se repent vite. Notre gouvernement organisé ne se repent pas, lui, de ses crimes diaboliques comme ceux du Jallianwalla, de Lahore, de Kassur, d’Akalgar, de Ramnagar, etc. Mais j’ai fait verser des larmes à la foule repentante à Gujararanwalla et obtenu un sincère aveu de repentir de la part de ceux qui en faisaient partie pendant ce mois d’avril si plein 127 d’événements. Je me sers donc maintenant de la Non-Coopération pour développer la démocratie et j’invite respectueusement tous les chefs hésitants à donner leur aide, en ne condamnant point d’avance une méthode de purification nationale, de discipline et de sacrifice.
U||... Ma foi dans le peuple est illimitée, sa nature est remarquablement compréhensive. Que les chefs ne manquent pas de confiance...
U||Je termine en donnant quelques règles qui peuvent servir de guide.
U||1o Aucun nouveau volontaire ne doit être admis à des manifestations importantes. Seuls par conséquent, ceux qui ont le plus d’expérience doivent diriger.
U||2o Les volontaires doivent avoir sur eux un manuel d’instructions.
U||3o A l’époque des manifestations une revue des volontaires aura lieu où seront données les instructions spéciales.
U||4o Dans les gares, les volontaires ne doivent pas se grouper en un seul point, à l’endroit où doit se trouver le comité de réception, par exemple, mais se disséminer parmi la foule.
U||5o De grandes foules ne doivent jamais pénétrer dans les gares. Elles ne peuvent manquer de gêner la circulation. Il y a autant d’honneur à attendre à l’extérieur.
U||6o Le premier devoir des volontaires est de s’assurer que les bagages des autres voyageurs ne sont pas piétinés.
U||7o Les manifestants ne doivent pénétrer dans la gare que quelques instants avant l’heure de l’arrivée. 128
U||8o Un passage libre doit être ménagé en face du train pour donner accès aux autres voyageurs.
U||9o Un autre passage devrait, si possible, être ménagé à mi-chemin au milieu des manifestants pour permettre aux chefs de sortir.
U||10o Ne pas faire de haie. C’est humiliant.
U||11o Les manifestants doivent rester à leur place jusqu’à ce que le chef ait pris place dans sa voiture ou jusqu’à ce qu’un volontaire autorisé ait donné le signal convenu.
U||12o Les cris nationaux ne doivent pas être poussés n’importe comment, n’importe quand, ni tout le temps, et doivent être convenus d’avance. Ils doivent être poussés seulement à l’arrivée du train et lorsque les chefs ont pris place dans leurs voitures, et de temps à autre pendant le trajet. Il serait absurde d’élever des objections sous prétexte que la manifestation perd de sa spontanéité et devient machinale. La spontanéité dépend du nombre, de l’enthousiasme créé par les cris et par-dessus tout de la physionomie générale des manifestants, non pas de la force ni de la variété des bruits. La nature des manifestations d’une nation est caractéristique du genre d’éducation qu’elle a reçu. Un Mahométan qui prie silencieusement dans sa mosquée exprime tout aussi bien ses sentiments qu’un Hindou dans son temple en faisant retentir sa voix ou son gong ou l’un et l’autre.
U||13o Il faut que la foule s’aligne sur le parcours et ne suive pas les voitures. Si des piétons font partie du cortège, ils doivent prendre leur place sans bruit et avec ordre et ne pas s’y joindre selon leur fantaisie.
U||129
U||14o La foule ne doit pas entourer le chef, mais au contraire s’écarter de lui.
U||15o Ceux qui se trouvent au dernier rang ou à la circonférence ne doivent jamais pousser devant eux mais suivre le mouvement lorsque la poussée a lieu de leur côté.
U||16o Il faut protéger particulièrement les femmes qui se trouvent dans la foule.
U||17o Il ne faut jamais amener de jeunes enfants dans la foule.
U||18o Il faut qu’aux réunions les volontaires soient dispersés dans la foule, qu’ils sachent faire des signaux avec un drapeau ou avec un sifflet afin de se communiquer leurs instructions lorsqu’ils ne sont pas à portée de la voix.
U||19o Ce n’est pas à l’auditoire de maintenir l’ordre. Il le fait en restant immobile et en gardant le silence.
U||20o Il faut avant toute chose une obéissance absolue aux ordres des volontaires.
U||Cette liste n’a pas la prétention d’être complète. Elle ne fait qu’indiquer quelques exemples et a pour but de stimuler la pensée et de faire naître la discussion. J’espère que tous les journaux de langues indigènes traduiront cet article.

U||TROIS CRIS NATIONAUX
U||Pendant mon voyage de Madras, j’eus l’occasion à Bedzwada de faire quelques remarques au sujet des cris nationaux et de suggérer qu’il vaudrait mieux en avoir pour des idéaux que pour des hommes. Je demandai à l’auditoire de remplacer Mahatma Gandhiki Jai et Mahomed Ali-Shaukat Aliki Jai par Hindu Mussalmanki Jai. Notre frère Shaukat Ali, qui parla ensuite, l’établit comme règle. Il avait remarqué qu’en dépit de l’Union Hindoue-Musulmane, si les Hindous criaient Bande Mataram, les musulmans faisaient immédiatement retentir Allaho Akbar et vice versa. Ceci, dit-il fort justement, était discordant pour l’oreille et montrait que le peuple n’agissait pas en communion d’esprit. Trois cris seulement devraient être admis: Allaho Akbar chanté joyeusement par les Hindous et les Musulmans pour exprimer que Dieu seul est grand et nul autre. Le second cri devrait être Bande Mataram (Salut Patrie) ou Bharat Mataki Jai (Victoire à Notre Mère Hind). Le troisième, Hindu Mussulmanki Jai, 
U||sans lequel il ne saurait y avoir de victoire pour l’Inde ni de vraie démonstration de la grandeur de Dieu. Je désirerais vivement que les journaux et les hommes politiques adoptent l’idée du Maulana 131 et décident le peuple à ne pousser que ces trois cris. Ils expriment beaucoup de choses. Le premier est une prière, une confession de notre insignifiance et par conséquent un signe d’humilité. C’est un cri pour lequel tous les Musulmans et tous les Hindous devraient s’unir dans un sentiment de respect et de prière. Il ne faut pas que les Hindous hésitent à employer des mots arabes lorsque le sens en est non seulement inoffensif mais ennoblissant. Dieu n’attache pas d’importance à une langue plus qu’à une autre. Bande Mataram en dehors des souvenirs merveilleux qu’il évoque, exprime l’unique souhait national, à savoir que l’Inde s’élève et atteigne toute sa grandeur. Et je préférerais Bande Mataram à Bharat Mataki Jai parce que ce serait reconnaître courtoisement l
U||a supériorité du Bengale par le cœur et l’intelligence; et comme l’Inde ne peut rien devenir sans l’union de l’âme hindoue et de l’âme musulmane, Hindu-Mussulmanki Jai est un cri que nous n’oublierons sans doute jamais.
U||Ces cris ne doivent pas être poussés d’une façon discordante. Dès que quelqu’un lance un des trois, tout le monde doit immédiatement le reprendre et chacun ne pas hurler celui qu’il préfère. Qui ne veut pas s’y joindre peut s’abstenir et doit considérer comme un manquement aux bonnes manières d’intercaler le sien lorsqu’un autre a été poussé. Il serait également préférable que les trois cris fussent dans l’ordre cité plus haut. Il ne faut pas non plus qu’ils soient répétés trop fréquemment. Lorsqu’un chef populaire traverse une gare on entend parfois le même hurlement poussé sans interruption. Je ne crois pas que ce bruit incessant fasse le moindre bien 132 à la nation si ce n’est de lui fournir un médiocre exercice pour les poumons. Il faudrait songer en outre aux nerfs de notre chef. C’est un gaspillage national de le tenir occupé à regarder la foule ou de l’obliger à écouter pendant une demi-heure de suite un cri poussé en son honneur ou en l’honneu
U||r d’un autre. Il nous faut cultiver le sens des proportions.

U||LA HANTISE DES ÉCOLES ET DES COLLÈGES UNIVERSITAIRES
U||On a beaucoup parlé et beaucoup écrit contre notre intention de boycotter les écoles et les collèges universitaires placés sous le contrôle du Gouvernement. On dit que notre proposition est «malfaisante», «nuisible» et «contraire aux intérêts les plus importants du pays»...
U||J’ai fait tout mon possible pour découvrir mon erreur, mais ces efforts n’ont abouti qu’à fortifier ma conviction; ce serait une faute aussi grave de recevoir du gouvernement une éducation quelconque, toute supérieure qu’elle puisse être, que de boire le lait le plus crémeux s’il renfermait du poison.
U|| 
U||133
U||... Les adversaires de ma suggestion ne se rendent pas suffisamment compte des injustices commises envers le Califat et au Pendjab. Ils ne sentent pas que ces injustices démontrent d’une façon concluante comment l’activité du gouvernement actuel dans son ensemble est nuisible au progrès national... Je suis absolument certain qu’ils n’enverraient pas leurs enfants à une école où ils risqueraient de recevoir une éducation qui les avilisse au lieu de les ennoblir. Je suis également certain qu’ils n’enverraient pas leurs enfants à une école gouvernée, dirigée ou même influencée par un voleur qui leur aurait pris ce qu’ils possédaient. Je considère que les enfants de la nation sont avilis dans les écoles et collèges du gouvernement. Je considère que ces écoles et ces collèges sont sous l’influence d’un gouvernement qui a volontairement dépouillé la nation de son honneur et par conséquent qu’il est du devoir de la nation d’en retirer ses enfants. Il est possible que m
U||ême dans ces écoles certains résistent à cet avilissement; mais il serait mal d’encourager l’humiliation nationale qui s’y poursuit parce que quelques-uns se sont élevés au-dessus de leur entourage. A mon avis il est trop évident à l’heure actuelle que les chefs révérés de la nation ne se rendent pas compte de cette corruption des écoles placées sous le contrôle du gouvernement.
U||On alléguera que les écoles ne sont pas pires qu’elles ne l’étaient avant le tort fait au Pendjab ou avant la trahison du Califat et que nous les tolérions alors. Je l’admets. Cependant en ce qui me concerne personnellement, les événements du Pendjab et du Califat, ont complètement changé mon opinion sur 134 le système actuel de gouvernement. L’ignorance où j’étais de sa perversité inhérente me le rendait suffisamment tolérable pour ne pas m’opposer à ses écoles. Aussi je crains... que les adversaires du projet de boycottage ne donnent pas aux injustices commises la même importance que moi...
U||Le jour où garçons et filles videront les écoles du gouvernement marquera une révolution dans la pensée nationale. Il indiquera que nous ne nous laisserons plus halluciner par ses écoles et par ses collèges. La nation n’est-elle pas capable de se charger de sa propre éducation sans l’intervention du gouvernement, sans sa protection, ses conseils ou ses subventions? Abandonner les écoles actuelles c’est avoir conscience que nous sommes capables d’organiser notre propre enseignement malgré des difficultés himalayennes.

U||LA HANTISE DES TRIBUNAUX
U||Si les magistrats et les tribunaux n’exerçaient pas sur nous une sorte d’attrait magique et s’ils n’avaient pas de racoleurs pour nous attirer dans le bourbier des cours de justice et pour faire appel à nos passions les plus basses, notre existence serait bien plus 135 heureuse. Que ceux qui fréquentent les Tribunaux—les meilleurs d’entre eux—avouent que l’atmosphère en est fétide, de chaque côté s’alignent les faux témoins qui, soit par amitié, soit pour de l’argent sont prêts à vendre leur âme. Mais le pire c’est qu’ils soutiennent l’autorité d’un gouvernement. Ils sont censés administrer la justice et sont par conséquent appelés les gardiens de la liberté d’une nation. Mais lorsqu’ils soutiennent un gouvernement malfaisant ils ne sont plus les gardiens de la liberté, ils font crouler les maisons afin d’étouffer l’âme d’une nation. Voilà comment agissent les tribunaux de la Loi Martiale et les «tribunaux exceptionnels» du Pendjab. Nous les avons 
U||vus dans leur nudité. Ils sont ainsi en temps normal lorsqu’il s’agit de juger un différend entre une race supérieure et ses ilotes. Il en est de même dans le monde entier. Voyez le procès de l’officier anglais qui avait torturé de sang-froid des nègres inoffensifs à Nairobi, et la peine ridiculement légère à laquelle il fut condamné. Un seul Anglais a-t-il jamais subi le dernier châtiment ou quelque chose de ce genre pour avoir commis dans l’Inde des meurtres barbares? Qu’on ne s’imagine pas que les choses seraient changées lorsque juges et procureurs anglais auraient été remplacés par des juges et procureurs indiens. Les Anglais ne sont pas naturellement corrompus, les Indiens ne sont pas nécessairement des anges. Tous deux subissent l’influence de leur entourage. Pendant l’état de siège, les juges et les procureurs indiens se montrèrent coupables d’actions aussi noires que les juges et les procureurs anglais. Si à Mabianwala ce fut un Bosworth Smith qui 136 insulta 
U||les femmes, ce furent des Indiens qui les torturèrent à Amritsar.
U||Ce que j’attaque c’est le système. Je n’en veux pas aux Anglais parce qu’ils sont anglais. Je respecte un certain nombre d’entre eux comme je les respectais avant de m’être aperçu de l’impossibilité de perfectionner le système actuel. M. Andrews et quelques autres me sont peut-être plus chers encore que jadis. Mais je ne pourrais pas rendre hommage à celui que je considère comme plus qu’un frère s’il devenait Vice-Roi des Indes. Je ne croirais pas qu’en acceptant ce poste il lui fut possible de rester pur. Il se verrait contraint d’administrer selon un système qui est corrompu en soi. Satan emploie généralement des instruments moraux et le langage de l’éthique pour donner à son but un air respectable.
U||Je me suis écarté un peu du sujet pour démontrer que ce Gouvernement, fût-il entièrement composé d’Indiens, s’il conservait l’organisation actuelle nous serait tout aussi intolérable qu’à présent. Et c’est pourquoi la nomination de lord Sinha à un poste élevé ne me remplit pas d’une joie débordante. Il nous faut l’égalité absolue en théorie et en pratique et le pouvoir de nous passer des rapports avec les Anglais si cela nous plaît.
U||Mais pour en revenir aux tribunaux et aux magistrats nous ne pouvons atteindre cette position désirable tant que nous considérons avec un respect superstitieux les soi-disant palais de justice. Que ceux dont la soif de vengeance ou l’avidité ou les justes réclamations sont satisfaites ne s’aveuglent pas sur le but véritable des tribunaux: la permanence de l’autorité du gouvernement qu’ils représentent. Sans les 137 tribunaux le gouvernement ne durerait pas une journée. J’admets que, même avec mon plan, les tribunaux conserveront leur pouvoir sur les gens lorsque tous les avocats indiens les auront abandonnés et qu’il n’y aura plus de causes civiles à plaider. Mais alors ils auront cessé de nous tromper. Ils auront perdu leur prestige moral et par conséquent leur air d’honorabilité.
U|| 
U||Au point de vue économique, on n’a jamais considéré ce que font perdre les tribunaux à la nation et pourtant ce n’est pas une bagatelle. Chaque institution organisée d’après le système actuel l’est avec une prodigalité extravagante et les tribunaux plus que tout autre. J’ai quelque notion de ce qu’ils coûtent en Angleterre, je suis renseigné sur ce qu’ils coûtent aux Indes et très documenté sur ce qu’ils coûtent dans le Sud-Afrique. Je n’hésite point à dire que ceux de l’Inde sont relativement les plus exagérés et n’ont aucun rapport avec les ressources économiques du peuple. Les meilleurs avocats de l’Afrique du Sud, et il y en a d’extrêmement compétents, n’oseraient jamais demander les honoraires des avocats de l’Inde. Quinze guinées sont à peu près le maximum pour une consultation juridique. On a vu dans l’Inde demander jusqu’à 7000 roupies. Il y a quelque chose de criminel dans un système qui permet à un magistrat de gagner cinquante à cent mi
U||lle roupies par mois. La profession n’est pas—ne devrait pas—être une affaire de spéculation. Le meilleur avocat devrait être accessible au plus pauvre à un prix raisonnable. Mais nous avons imité les magistrats anglais et ajouté à leurs méthodes. Les Anglais trouvent le climat 138 de l’Inde pénible, ils conservent les habitudes des climats froids et durs, il leur faut calculer les séjours fréquents dans les montagnes et dans leur île natale, et mettre de côté une forte somme pour l’éducation aristocratique de leurs enfants. Leurs honoraires sont pour ces raisons naturellement très élevés et l’Inde ne peut pas supporter cette lourde charge. Nous nous imaginons que pour nous sentir les égaux des magistrats anglais il nous faut demander les mêmes honoraires écrasants. Ce serait bien triste pour l’Inde s’il lui fallait hériter des appointements anglais et des goûts anglais qui conviennent si peu à l’atmosphère indienne. Tout magistrat considérant les tribunaux et sa p
U||rofession du point de vue que je viens d’indiquer arrivera forcément à conclure que le meilleur moyen de servir la nation est de cesser d’exercer. Pour arriver à une autre conclusion il faudrait qu’il pût démentir l’exposé des faits que je viens d’avancer.

U||A TOUT ANGLAIS HABITANT L’INDE
U||Cher ami,
U||Je souhaite que tout Anglais lise cet appel et le médite sérieusement. Permettez-moi de me présenter 139 à vous. A mon humble avis nul Indien n’a coopéré plus que moi avec le Gouvernement Britannique pendant mes vingt-neuf années consécutives d’activité publique et dans des circonstances qui eussent fait de tout autre un rebelle. Je vous prie de me croire si je vous dis que ma coopération n’était point fondée sur la crainte des châtiments prévus par vos lois ni sur d’autres raisons égoïstes. Ma coopération était libre, volontaire, elle s’appuyait sur la conviction que la somme totale de l’activité du gouvernement Britannique avait pour but le bien de l’Inde. J’ai mis quatre fois ma vie en péril pour l’Empire: à l’époque de la guerre Sud-Africaine lorsque j’avais la responsabilité du corps d’ambulanciers volontaires qui fut cité à l’ordre du jour par le Général Buller; à l’époque de la guerre des Zoulous au Natal lorsque je dirigeais un autre corps sani
U||taire; au commencement de la dernière guerre lorsque je formais un corps d’infirmiers et que par suite de la fatigue j’eus une pleurésie grave, enfin lorsque fidèle à la promesse que j’avais faite à lord Chelmsford lors de la Conférence de Delhi, j’entrepris une active campagne de recrutement dans le Kaira nécessitant de longues marches fatigantes et qu’une crise de dyssenterie faillit m’emporter. Tout ceci je l’ai fait parce que j’étais persuadé que des actes comme les miens devaient placer mon pays sur le même rang que les autres parties de l’Empire. Encore en décembre dernier je demandais avec insistance une coopération loyale. Je croyais sincèrement que M. Lloyd George tiendrait la promesse qu’il avait faite aux Musulmans et que les atrocités commises au Pendjab une fois connues, les habitants du Pendjab obtiendraient une 140 réparation complète. Mais la duplicité de M. Lloyd George et votre façon de la considérer et d’excuser les atrocités commises ont absolumen
U||t détruit la foi que j’avais dans les bonnes intentions du Gouvernement et dans la nation dont il dépend.
U||Néanmoins, si je ne crois plus à vos bonnes intentions je me plais à reconnaître votre bravoure et je sais que là où vous ne céderiez pas devant la justice et la raison, vous céderiez volontiers devant la bravoure.
U||Jugez de ce que l’Empire coûte à l’Inde:
U||Exploitation des ressources de l’Inde pour le bénéfice de la Grande-Bretagne;
U||Dépenses toujours croissantes pour l’armée, et le plus coûteux des fonctionnarismes;
U||Tous les services de l’Administration organisés avec une prodigalité extravagante sans aucune considération pour la pauvreté de l’Inde;
U||Désarmement et émasculation complète d’une nation par crainte qu’elle ne devienne un danger pour une poignée d’entre vous qui vous trouvez parmi nous;
U||Commerce de boissons alcoolisées et de stupéfiants afin de subvenir aux frais d’une administration trop lourde par le haut;
U||Législation de plus en plus sévère afin d’étouffer une agitation grandissante qui cherche à faire connaître la torture d’une nation;
U||Traitement dégradant infligé aux Indiens habitant vos «Dominions».
U||Et vous avez montré un mépris absolu de ce que nous éprouvons en glorifiant l’administration du 141 Pendjab et en insultant aux sentiments des Musulmans.
U||Je sais que vous ne nous en voudriez pas, si nous pouvions nous battre et que nous vous arrachions le sceptre des mains. Mais vous savez bien que nous ne le pouvons pas. Vous avez fait en sorte que nous soyons incapables de nous battre franchement, honorablement. La bravoure sur le champ de bataille nous est donc impossible. La bravoure de l’âme nous reste. Je sais qu’à elle aussi vous serez sensible. Mon but est de faire naître cette bravoure. La Non-Coopération n’est pas autre chose qu’un entraînement au sacrifice de soi. Pourquoi donc coopérerions-nous avec vous lorsque nous savons que votre administration de ce pays nous réduit à un esclavage qui devient chaque jour plus grand? Si le peuple répond à mon appel, ce n’est pas dû à ma personnalité. J’aimerais que vous cessiez de croire que j’y suis pour quelque chose—les frères Ali également. Ma personnalité ne ferait naître aucune réponse à un cri Anti-Musulman si j’étais assez stupide pour en pousser un et le nom magiq
U||ue des frères Ali n’inspirerait aucun enthousiasme aux Musulmans s’ils poussaient follement un cri anti-Hindou. Le peuple accourt par milliers pour nous écouter parce qu’aujourd’hui nous représentons la voix d’une nation qui gémit écrasée sous un talon de fer. Les frères Ali étaient vos amis comme je l’étais, comme je le suis encore. Ma religion me défend toute animosité à votre égard. Je ne lèverais pas la main contre vous, même si j’en avais la puissance. Je veux vous vaincre uniquement par ma souffrance. Les frères Ali tireraient certainement l’épée du fourreau s’ils le pouvaient pour défendre leur religion et leur 142 pays. Mais eux et moi faisons cause commune avec le peuple de l’Inde pour tâcher d’exprimer ce qu’il ressent et trouver un remède à sa détresse.
U||Vous êtes en quête d’un remède pour supprimer cette effervescence croissante du sentiment national. Je me permets de vous suggérer que la seule façon d’y mettre fin est d’en supprimer les causes. Cela vous est encore possible, vous pouvez contraindre M. Lloyd George à tenir parole. Je vous assure qu’il s’est réservé plusieurs portes de sortie. Vous pouvez contraindre le Vice-Roi à donner sa démission en faveur d’un meilleur et revenir sur votre opinion au sujet du Général Dyer et de Sir Michael O’Dwyer. Vous pouvez contraindre le Gouvernement à réunir en conférence les chefs reconnus du peuple, élus par eux et représentant toutes les opinions afin de chercher le moyen de donner le Swaraj à l’Inde conformément aux désirs de son peuple.
U||Mais vous ne pouvez le faire que si vous considérez tout Indien véritablement comme votre égal et comme votre frère. Je ne vous demande pas votre protection. Je vous montre uniquement, en ami, une solution honorable à un grave problème. L’autre solution, la répression, vous est ouverte. Je vous prédis qu’elle ne réussira pas. Elle a déjà emprisonné deux braves de Panipat parce qu’ils ont exprimé librement leurs opinions; un autre est en jugement à Lahore pour avoir exprimé les mêmes opinions. Un autre dans le district d’Oudh est déjà incarcéré; un quatrième attend son tour d’être jugé. Vous devez savoir ce qui se passe autour de vous. Notre propagande est faite contre cette répression attendue. Je vous demande respectueusement de choisir la meilleure 143 méthode, de faire cause commune avec le peuple de l’Inde dont vous mangez le pain. Vouloir contrarier ses aspirations c’est être déloyal envers le pays.
U||Votre fidèle ami,
U||M. K. Gandhi.
U||27 octobre 1920.
U||SI JE SUIS ARRÊTÉ
U||Article paru dans le Navjivan.
U||Je ne cesse de me demander quelle serait l’attitude du peuple si l’on m’arrêtait. Mes collaborateurs m’ont également posé la question. Quelle serait la position de l’Inde si le peuple affolé par son amour faisait fausse route? Quelle serait ma position à moi?
U||Des ruisseaux de sang répandus par le gouvernement ne sont pas pour m’effrayer mais je serais profondément affecté si le peuple, par amour de moi ou en mon nom allait seulement jusqu’à insulter le gouvernement. Il me couvrirait de honte s’il perdait son empire sur soi lors de mon arrestation. La nation n’arrivera à aucun progrès si elle ne compte que sur moi. Le progrès n’est possible que si le peuple comprend et suit le chemin que je lui ai tracé. Je désire pour cette raison qu’il conserve un sang-froid absolu 144 et considère le jour où je serais arrêté comme un jour de réjouissance. Je désire que même nos faiblesses actuelles disparaissent ce jour là.
U||Quel serait le mobile du Gouvernement en m’arrêtant? Le Gouvernement n’est pas mon ennemi; je n’ai pas un atome d’inimitié contre lui. Mais il croit que je suis l’âme de l’agitation et que, si l’on m’éloignait, les administrateurs et les administrés auraient la paix, que le peuple m’obéit aveuglément. Le gouvernement n’est pas seul à le croire; certains de nos chefs partagent son opinion. Comment le gouvernement peut-il s’assurer des sentiments du peuple? Comment peut-il se rendre compte si le peuple comprend mes conseils ou s’il est simplement ébloui par mes paroles? Il n’a qu’un moyen de s’en assurer: m’arrêter. Il reste bien entendu l’alternative de supprimer les causes qui m’ont amené à offrir ces conseils. Mais, enivré par son pouvoir, le Gouvernement ne voit pas ses propres erreurs et les verrait-il qu’il ne les admettrait pas. Il n’a donc qu’un seul moyen: se rendre compte de la force du peuple en m’arrêtant. Si par cet acte le peuple est terri
U||fié au point de se soumettre, il aura mérité les injustices dont ont souffert le Califat et le Pendjab.
U||Si d’autre part le peuple a recours à la violence il fera simplement le jeu du gouvernement, les aéroplanes jetteront alors des bombes sur la population, ses Dyers tireront sur lui et ses Smiths soulèveront les voiles de nos femmes. D’autres officiers seront là qui l’obligeront à se frotter le visage contre terre et à ramper sur le ventre, et le châtieront à coups de fouet. Chacun de ces résultats est également mauvais et ne nous donnera pas le «Swaraj». Dans d’autres 145 pays les gouvernements ont été renversés par la force brutale seule, mais j’ai souvent démontré que l’Inde ne saurait obtenir son Home Rule en employant cette force. Quelle devrait donc être l’attitude du peuple si l’on m’arrêtait? La réponse est simple. Il faut que le peuple,
U||1o Reste calme et paisible.
U||2o Mais qu’il n’observe pas de «hartal».
U||3o Qu’il ne tienne pas de meetings.
U||4o Qu’il ait l’œil ouvert.
U||Je m’attendrais, bien entendu, à voir:
U||5o Toutes les écoles du gouvernement se vider et se fermer.
U||6o Les magistrats suspendre leurs fonctions en plus grand nombre.
U||7o Tous les litiges jugés par arbitrage privé.
U||8o Des écoles et collèges universitaires nationaux s’ouvrir très nombreux.
U||9o Des milliers d’hommes et de femmes renoncer à tout tissu étranger et porter uniquement des vêtements tissés et filés à la main, et le tissu étranger actuellement en magasin vendu ou brûlé par eux.
U||10o Tous refuser de s’engager dans l’armée ou de servir le Gouvernement.
U||11o Ceux qui peuvent gagner leur vie autrement abandonner les emplois du gouvernement et même l’armée.
U||12o Chacun souscrire au fonds national autant qu’il est nécessaire.
U||13o Les possesseurs de titres y renoncer en plus grand nombre.
U||14o Les électeurs, encore incertains, considérer que 146 c’est un péché d’envoyer des représentants aux Conseils.
U||15o Les candidats aux élections retirer leur candidature et ceux qui auraient été élus démissionner.
U||Si le peuple prend ces résolutions et les met en pratique il aura certainement le Swaraj avant un an. Nous l’aurons atteint, quand il se montrera capable de cette force. La nation signera alors ma mise en liberté et j’en serai heureux. La liberté dont je jouis à présent est pour moi une prison. Si le peuple employait la violence pour me délivrer et s’il attendait ensuite mon aide pour obtenir le Swaraj son incompétence serait démontrée. Ni moi, ni personne ne pouvons donner le Swaraj à la nation. Elle l’aura dès qu’elle aura prouvé qu’elle est prête.
U||Je dirai pour terminer qu’il est parfaitement inutile d’incriminer le gouvernement. Nous avons le gouvernement que nous méritons. Lorsque nous serons meilleurs, le gouvernement le sera également. Ce n’est qu’à ce moment-là que nous aurons notre Swaraj. La Non-Coopération montre que la nation a pris la résolution de devenir meilleure. Va-t-elle abandonner sa résolution si l’on m’arrête et coopérer avec le gouvernement? Si le peuple devient fou, s’il adopte la violence et qu’il en soit amené à ramper sur le ventre, à frotter son visage sur le sol, à saluer l’Union Jack et à faire pour cela quarante kilomètres à pied, qu’est-ce sinon coopérer? Mieux vaut mourir que de s’abaisser ainsi. En un mot de quelque façon que vous considériez la question vous verrez que la seule ligne de conduite pour le peuple est celle que j’ai indiquée.

U||L’UNIVERSITÉ NATIONALE DE GUJERAT
U||En créant une Université et en organisant un Collège à Ahmedabad le Gujerat a démontré que la Non-Coopération avait également son côté constructif. Seulement, comme la Non-Coopération est d’abord un acte de purification, il lui faut détruire avant de construire. L’Université Nationale se dresse aujourd’hui pour protester contre l’injustice britannique et défendre notre honneur national. Mais elle demeurera. Elle s’inspire des idéaux nationaux d’une Inde unie. Elle représente une religion qui est le Dharma des Hindous et l’Islam des Mahométans. Elle veut sauver les langues indigènes de l’oubli immérité et en faire la source de la régénération nationale et de la culture indienne. Elle considère que l’étude systématique des cultures asiatiques n’est pas moins essentielle pour acquérir une éducation parfaite que celle des sciences occidentales. Elle devra fouiller dans les immenses trésors du sanscrit, de l’arabe, du persan, du pali et du magahdi afin d’y déc
U||ouvrir où se trouve la source de la force pour la nation. Elle ne se propose pas seulement de se nourrir des anciennes cultures ou de les copier: elle espère plutôt créer une culture nouvelle basée sur les traditions et enrichie 148 par l’expérience des temps plus rapprochés. Elle représente la synthèse des différentes cultures qui se sont implantées aux Indes, qui ont agi sur l’existence de l’Inde et qui ont à leur tour subi l’influence de l’esprit du sol. Cette synthèse sera, bien entendu, selon le Swadeshi où toute culture est assurée d’avoir sa place légitime, non sur le modèle américain où une culture prédomine et absorbe toutes les autres, où le but n’est pas l’harmonie mais une unité artificielle et forcée. Pour cette raison l’Université a voulu que ses étudiants apprissent à connaître toutes les religions de l’Inde. Les Hindous ont ainsi l’occasion d’étudier le Koran et les Musulmans de savoir ce que contiennent les Shastras hindous. L’Université
U|| n’a exclu qu’une seule chose de son programme, c’est l’esprit d’exclusion qui considère comme «intouchable»[72] une section quelconque de l’humanité. L’étude de l’hindoustani qui est un mélange national de sanscrit, d’hindi et d’urdu persanisé est obligatoire. L’esprit d’indépendance sera développé non seulement par l’étude de la religion, de la politique et de l’histoire mais aussi par la préparation professionnelle qui seule peut donner à la jeunesse du pays l’indépendance économique et le soutien que procure le respect de soi-même. L’Université espère organiser de meilleures écoles dans toutes les villes de province afin que l’instruction se répande au loin et pénètre le peuple le plus tôt possible.
U||Le Gujerati employé comme langue éducative facilitera ce progrès et il n’y aura plus, entre les gens cultivés et les ignorants, cette séparation qui 149 est une sorte de suicide. L’un des effets d’une éducation industrielle pour les classes distinguées et d’une éducation littéraire pour les classes industrielles sera en grande partie d’empêcher la distribution inégale de la fortune et en même temps de mettre fin au mécontentement social qui en résulte. Les plus graves défauts des Universités du Gouvernement c’est d’être sous le contrôle d’étrangers et d’attribuer une valeur fausse aux diverses carrières. L’Université du Gujerat en ne coopérant pas avec le Gouvernement y remédie automatiquement. Si les fondateurs et les promoteurs sont fidèles à cette résolution jusqu’à ce que le Gouvernement soit devenu national, ils acquerront une perception nette des idéaux et des besoins de la Nation. Demandons à Dieu que les Travailleurs pour la cause aient la foi et la 
U||force nécessaires pour défendre la bannière qu’ils ont déployée.
U||17 novembre 1920.
U||LE SYSTÈME DES CASTES
U||J’ai reçu plusieurs lettres irritées à propos de mes remarques sur le système des Castes... Le point soulevé par mes correspondants mérite qu’on le considère et qu’on y réponde. Ils déclarent que la 150 conservation du système des castes serait la ruine de l’Inde et que l’esprit de caste a réduit l’Inde à l’esclavage. A mon avis ce n’est pas l’esprit de caste qui a fait de nous des esclaves, c’est notre avidité et notre mépris des vertus essentielles. Si l’Hindouisme ne s’est pas désagrégé c’est à l’esprit de caste que nous le devons.
U||Comme toutes les autres organisations le système des castes a souffert d’excroissances malignes. Je ne considère fondamentales, naturelles et essentielles que les quatre divisions[73]. Les innombrables subdivisions peuvent parfois être commodes mais elles sont souvent gênantes. Plus tôt la fusion aura lieu, mieux cela vaudra. La suppression et la reconstitution silencieuses des subdivisions ont toujours eu lieu et continueront forcément. On peut être certain que l’influence sociale et l’opinion publique se mêleront de ce problème. Mais je suis tout à fait opposé à ce qu’on essaye de détruire les divisions fondamentales. Le système des castes n’est pas basé sur l’inégalité, il n’y est pas question d’infériorité et si pareille question se posait, comme à Madras et Maharastra et ailleurs, il faudrait certainement refréner cette tendance. Mais il ne semble pas qu’il y ait une raison sérieuse de mettre fin à ce système à cause de ses abus. Il se prête facilement à la r
U||éforme. Il n’est point douteux que l’esprit démocratique, qui s’étend rapidement dans l’Inde, débarrassera cette institution de toute idée de prédominance et de subordination.
U||151
U||L’esprit démocratique n’est pas une chose mécanique qui peut s’ajuster en abolissant les formes extérieures. Il demande une transformation du cœur. Si les castes sont un obstacle au développement de l’âme, l’existence de cinq religions dans l’Inde: l’Hindouisme, l’Islamisme, le Christianisme, le Zorastrianisme et le Judaïsme en sont une également. L’esprit démocratique exige l’inculcation de l’esprit de fraternité et je n’éprouve aucune difficulté à considérer un Mahométan ou un Chrétien comme mon frère, absolument comme s’il était frère par le sang, et si l’on doit à l’Hindouisme la doctrine des castes on lui doit aussi d’avoir inculqué la fraternité essentielle non seulement des hommes mais de tout ce qui vit.
U||Un de mes correspondants suggère que nous abolissions les castes pour adopter le système Européen des classes, voulant dire sans doute qu’il faut supprimer l’hérédité des castes. Je suis porté à croire que la loi de l’hérédité est une loi éternelle et que toute tentative pour la transformer doit forcément conduire ainsi qu’il est déjà arrivé, au désordre absolu. Je vois une grande utilité à considérer un brahmane comme restant brahmane pendant toute son existence. S’il cesse de se conduire en brahmane il cesse naturellement d’inspirer le respect qui est dû à un véritable brahmane. Il est facile de se rendre compte des difficultés innombrables qui surgiraient s’il fallait organiser des tribunaux pour punir et récompenser, pour dégrader ou pour donner de l’avancement. Si les Hindous croient, ainsi qu’ils doivent le faire, à la réincarnation et à la transmigration des âmes, ils savent que la nature sans se tromper rétablira l’équilibre en dégradant le brahman
U||e s’il se conduit mal 152 et en le réincarnant dans une caste inférieure alors qu’elle maintiendra au rang de brahmane celui qui a vécu en brahmane dans sa présente incarnation.
U||Je ne considère pas qu’il soit indispensable à l’esprit démocratique de boire, manger en commun et de s’unir par mariage. Je n’envisage pas une universalité de manières et de coutumes sous le plus démocratique des gouvernements. Nous devons chercher l’union dans la diversité... Dans la religion Hindoue il est défendu aux enfants de deux frères de s’épouser. Cette défense n’affecte en rien la cordialité des rapports; il est même probable qu’elle crée des relations plus saines. Dans les intérieurs Vaishnava j’ai vu des mères qui ne mangeaient pas dans la cuisine commune ni ne buvaient au bol commun, sans en devenir pour cela dédaigneuses, arrogantes et moins affectueuses. Ces contraintes disciplinaires ne sont pas mauvaises en soi. Poussées ridiculement à l’extrême elles peuvent être nuisibles et si elles ont pour but d’attribuer une supériorité elles deviennent des faiblesses et par conséquent un mal. Mais avec le temps et à mesure que surgiront des nécessités 
U||et des circonstances nouvelles, ces coutumes devront être avec circonspection modifiées et transformées.
U||Ainsi, tout en étant disposé à défendre comme je l’ai déjà fait la division en quatre castes, je considère l’intouchabilité[74] comme un crime monstrueux, 153 envers l’humanité ainsi que je l’ai souvent répété. Ce n’est pas une marque d’empire de soi, mais une prétention arrogante à la supériorité. Elle n’a jamais servi à rien d’utile et a abaissé un nombre incalculable 154 d’êtres humains, qui non seulement nous valent bien, mais rendent au pays de bien des façons, des services essentiels. C’est un péché dont l’Hindouisme doit se délivrer au plus tôt, s’il veut être 155 considéré comme une religion honorable et ennoblissante. Je ne vois pas une seule raison en sa faveur et je n’ai aucune hésitation à rejeter, dans les Ecritures, les passages, d’un caractère douteux, à l’appui de cette criminelle institution. A dire vrai je rejetterais toute autorité qui serait en contradiction avec la raison pondérée ou les commandements du cœur. L’autorité
U|| soutient et ennoblit les faibles lorsqu’elle est l’œuvre de la raison mais elle avilit lorsqu’elle supplante la raison sanctifiée par la «petite voix silencieuse qui est en nous.»

U||156
U||LE CONGRÈS NATIONAL
U||Le plus vaste et le plus important des Congrès[75] vient de se terminer. Ce fut la plus grande démonstration contre le système de gouvernement actuel qui ait jamais eu lieu. Le Président a exprimé la vérité absolue lorsqu’il a dit qu’à ce Congrès ce n’était pas le Président et les chefs qui entraînaient le peuple, mais le peuple qui l’entraînait lui et les chefs. Il était évident pour ceux qui se trouvaient sur l’estrade que le peuple avait pris les rênes en main. Ils eussent préféré aller moins vite.
U||Le Congrès consacra une journée à une discussion détaillée de la doctrine qui fut adoptée après deux nuits de réflexion par tous à l’exception de deux voix. Il consacra une journée à discuter une résolution de Non-Coopération qui fut adoptée avec un enthousiasme sans précédent. Il consacra le dernier jour à la lecture des trente-deux articles de la Constitution...
U||Après de sérieuses délibérations, le Congrès a pris trois décisions importantes. Il a exprimé en termes extrêmement clairs sa résolution d’obtenir son autonomie absolue, conservant si possible son association 157 avec le peuple britannique mais s’en séparant s’il le fallait. Il se propose d’y arriver uniquement par des moyens honorables et non-violents. Il a introduit dans la Constitution qui réglemente son action des changements fondamentaux et a fait acte de désintéressement en réduisant le nombre de ses délégués à un membre par cinquante mille habitants de l’Inde, et en insistant pour que ces délégués fussent véritablement les représentants de ceux qui veulent prendre une part active dans les affaires politiques du pays. Afin de s’assurer que tous les partis seraient représentés il a accepté le principe du «vote unique transférable». Il a appuyé la résolution de Non-Coopération adoptée à la session spéciale et l’a amplifiée à tous points de vue. Il a insi
U||sté sur la Non-Violence et déclaré que l’obtention de Swaraj dépend de l’harmonie complète entre les partis constituants de l’Inde; il a fait ressortir par conséquent l’importance de l’union Hindoue-Musulmane. Les délégués hindous ont demandé à leurs chefs de juger les différends entre Brahmanes et non-Brahmanes et ont insisté auprès de leurs supérieurs religieux sur la nécessité de se débarrasser du poison de l’intouchabilité. Le Congrès a dit aux parents dont les enfants sont à l’école et aux avocats qu’ils n’ont pas répondu à l’appel de la Nation en aussi grand nombre qu’ils auraient dû et qu’un effort plus grand devait être fait. Il s’ensuit nécessairement que ceux qui ne répondront pas rapidement à cette demande réitérée se verront peu à peu exclus des affaires publiques du pays. Le pays demande aux hommes et aux femmes de l’Inde de faire tout leur devoir.

U||NÉCESSITÉ D’ÊTRE HUMBLES
U||L’esprit de Non-Violence conduit nécessairement à l’humilité. La Non-Violence signifie confiance en Dieu, le Roc des Ages. Si nous voulons qu’il nous aide, il faut nous approcher de lui avec un cœur humble et contrit. Les Non-Coopérateurs ne doivent pas exploiter le succès surprenant qu’ils ont remporté au Congrès. Il nous faut être comme le manguier qui courbe la tête lorsqu’il porte des fruits. Sa grandeur réside dans son humilité majestueuse. Mais il paraît que les non-coopérateurs se sont montrés insolents et intolérants envers ceux qui ne partagent pas leurs idées. Ils perdront, j’en suis sûr, s’ils s’enflent d’orgueil, leur importance et leur gloire. Nous n’avons certainement pas lieu d’être mécontents du progrès accompli jusqu’à présent, mais nous n’avons pas grand chose à notre actif dont nous puissions être fiers. Il nous faudra faire bien d’autres sacrifices avant de pouvoir nous permettre de montrer de la fierté, encore moins de l’orgueil. Le
U||s milliers d’Indiens qui sont venus en foule au Congrès approuvent sans aucun doute la doctrine intellectuellement, mais peu d’entre eux l’ont mise en pratique. Sans parler de ceux qui plaident, combien de parents ont retiré leurs enfants 159 des écoles? Combien de ceux qui ont voté pour la Non-Coopération ont cessé d’employer du tissu étranger et se sont mis à filer?
U||La Non-Coopération n’est pas un mouvement de vantardise, de fanfaronnade et de bluff. Elle sert à mettre notre sincérité à l’épreuve. Elle nous demande un sacrifice silencieux et ferme de nous-mêmes. Elle exige la preuve de notre loyauté et de notre capacité pour le travail national. C’est un mouvement qui cherche à mettre ses idées en action, et plus nous agissons plus nous nous apercevons qu’il y a bien plus à accomplir que nous ne pensions. Et ce sentiment de notre imperfection doit nous rendre humbles.
U||Un Non-Coopérateur s’efforce d’attirer l’attention et de donner l’exemple non par la violence mais par une humilité discrète. Il laisse à la solidité de ses actions le soin de faire apprécier sa foi. Sa force provient de ce qu’il compte sur la correction de son attitude, et il en convaincra d’autant plus son adversaire qu’il interposera moins de paroles entre ses actions et celui-ci. La parole, surtout lorsqu’elle est arrogante, trahit un manque d’assurance et rend l’adversaire sceptique sur la réalité de l’acte. L’humilité est donc la clé qui ouvre rapidement la porte au succès. J’espère que tout Non Coopérateur reconnaîtra la nécessité d’être humble et de savoir se contenir. C’est parce qu’il y a si peu à faire et que ce peu tout entier dépend de nous-mêmes que j’ai osé émettre l’opinion que nous aurons le Swaraj avant un an.

U||LE PÉCHÉ D’INTOUCHABILITÉ
U||Il est intéressant de remarquer que le Comité qui se réunit avant le Congrès pour discuter les propositions du Congrès et le Comité du Congrès de Nagpur en 1920 ont accepté sans opposition la clause se rapportant au péché d’intouchabilité. L’Assemblée Nationale a bien agi en approuvant la résolution et en déclarant que pour obtenir le Swaraj il était nécessaire de faire disparaître cette souillure de l’Hindouisme. Le diable n’arrive à ses fins que parce qu’il est aidé par ses pareils. Il tire profit des faiblesses de notre nature pour avoir de l’empire sur nous. Le Gouvernement fait de même. C’est par nos vices et nos faiblesses qu’il conserve son autorité sur nous, et si nous voulons devenir insensibles à ses machinations il faut nous débarrasser de nos faiblesses. C’est pour cette raison que j’ai appelé la Non-Coopération une méthode de purification. Dès que la méthode aura fait son œuvre ce gouvernement s’effondrera faute d’être entouré de l’atmosph
U||ère qui lui est nécessaire, comme les moustiques qui cessent de fréquenter l’endroit où les fossés ont été asséchés et comblés. Une juste Némésis ne nous a-t-elle pas châtié pour le crime d’intouchabilité? N’avons-nous pas récolté ce que nous avons semé?... Nous avons tenu les parias à l’écart et maintenant 161 nous le sommes devenus nous-mêmes dans les colonies anglaises. Nous leur refusons de se servir de nos puits, nous leur jetons nos restes; leur ombre même semble nous polluer. En vérité il n’est pas d’accusation que nous ne lancions à la figure des Anglais que les parias ne pourraient nous lancer également.
U||Comment peut-on faire disparaître cette souillure de l’Hindouisme? «Faites aux autres ce que vous voudriez qu’on vous fît». J’ai souvent dit à des fonctionnaires anglais que s’ils étaient des amis et des serviteurs de l’Inde, ils devraient descendre de leur piédestal, abandonner leur attitude protectrice, montrer par leurs actes pleins d’amour qu’ils sont en toutes choses nos amis, et nous croire leurs égaux absolument comme leurs camarades anglais. Après les événements du Pendjab et du Califat, j’ai été un peu plus loin. Je leur ai demandé de se repentir et de changer de sentiments. Et c’est justement pour cela qu’il faut que nous autres Hindous nous nous repentions du mal que nous avons fait, que nous changions notre façon d’agir envers ceux que nous avons «supprimés» par un système tout aussi diabolique que celui du Gouvernement de l’Inde réprouvé par nous. Nous ne devons pas leur jeter comme une aumône quelques misérables écoles, nous ne devons pas adopter 
U||envers eux un air de supériorité. Il faut que nous les traitions comme nos propres frères et leur rendions l’héritage que nous leur avons enlevé. Et ceci ne doit pas être l’action de quelques réformateurs qui connaissent les Anglais, mais un effort volontaire et conscient de la part des masses. Nous ne devons pas attendre des siècles pour accomplir cette réforme attardée. Il faut 162 que nous nous efforcions d’y parvenir en cette année de grâce, d’épreuve, de préparation et de pénitence. C’est une réforme qui ne doit pas suivre le Swaraj mais le précéder.
U||L’«intouchabilité» n’est pas une sanction de la religion mais une invention de Satan. Le diable a toujours cité l’Ecriture Sainte. Mais l’Ecriture Sainte ne saurait être au-dessus de la Raison et de la Vérité. Elle a pour but de purifier la Raison et de rendre la Vérité plus éclatante. Je n’irais pas brûler un cheval sans tache parce qu’il paraît que les Vedas ont conseillé, toléré et autorisé ce sacrifice. Pour moi les Vedas sont divins, ils ne sont pas écrits. «La lettre tue»; c’est l’esprit qui communique la lumière, et l’esprit des Vedas est pureté, vérité, innocence, chasteté, simplicité, pardon et piété et tout ce qui rend l’homme et la femme braves et nobles. Il n’y a ni noblesse, ni bravoure à traiter les nobles boueurs résignés de la nation comme s’ils étaient moins que des chiens qu’il faut mépriser et couvrir de crachats. Plût à Dieu qu’il nous accordât à tous la force et la sagesse nécessaires pour devenir les boueurs de la nation c
U||omme les classes supprimées sont obligées de l’être. Il ne manque pas d’écuries d’Augias à nettoyer.[76]

U||HIND SWARAJ, le Home Rule de l’Inde.
U||C’est assurément un bonheur pour moi que la brochure portant ce titre attire l’attention générale. L’original 164 est en Gujerati. Elle a eu une carrière variée. Elle parut d’abord en Afrique du Sud dans les colonnes de l’Indian Opinion. Je l’avais écrite en 1908 après avoir quitté Londres, pendant le voyage, lorsque je retournais dans l’Afrique du Sud. J’avais eu l’occasion d’être en rapports avec tous les Indiens anarchistes de Londres. Leur bravoure m’avait frappé mais j’avais l’impression que leur zèle s’égarait. J’avais le sentiment que la violence n’était pas un remède aux maux de l’Inde et que sa civilisation demandait une arme différente et plus élevée pour la défendre. Le Satyâgraha de l’Afrique du Sud était encore dans l’enfance, il avait à peine deux ans, mais il était assez vigoureux cependant pour qu’il me fût possible d’en parler avec quelque assurance. Hind Swaraj reçut un tel accueil qu’il fut publié sous 165 forme de brochu
U||re et attira quelque attention dans l’Inde. Le Gouvernement de Bombay en défendit la circulation. Je répondis à cette attaque en en faisant paraître la traduction. Je considérais que je devais à mes amis Anglais de leur faire connaître ce qu’il renfermait. Selon moi c’est un livre que l’on peut mettre entre les mains d’un enfant. Il enseigne l’Evangile de l’amour à la place de celui de la haine. Il remplace la violence par l’abnégation et oppose la force de l’âme à la force brutale. Il en a paru plusieurs éditions et je le recommande à ceux qui voudraient le lire. Je n’en retire qu’un seul mot et cela par déférence, pour une dame de mes amies. J’en ai donné la raison dans la préface de l’édition indienne. La brochure condamne sévèrement «la civilisation moderne». Je l’écrivis en 1908 et ma conviction est 166 plus profonde que jamais aujourd’hui. Je suis persuadé que si l’Inde se débarrassait de la civilisation moderne, elle ne ferait qu’y gagner.
U||Mais je tiens à en prévenir le lecteur, il ne doit pas s’imaginer que je cherche aujourd’hui le Swaraj[78] tel qu’il y est décrit. Je sais que l’Inde n’est pas mûre pour cela. Le dire peut sembler impertinent mais c’est ma conviction. Je travaille pour arriver à la maîtrise personnelle qui y est décrite mais aujourd’hui je consacre mon activité publique au Swaraj parlementaire tel que le désire le peuple 167 de l’Inde. Mon but n’est pas de détruire les chemins de fer et les hôpitaux; j’en accueillerais pourtant avec plaisir la destruction naturelle. Les chemins de fer et les hôpitaux ne sont pas une preuve de civilisation pure et élevée. Ils sont tout au plus un mal nécessaire. Ni les uns ni les autres n’ajoutent un pouce à la stature morale d’une nation. Je ne cherche pas davantage la destruction complète des tribunaux, bien que je considère que ce soit une fin ardemment souhaitable. Je désire encore moins détruire les machines et les filatures. Il faudrait pour c
U||ela une simplicité 168 et un renoncement plus grands que le peuple n’en serait capable à présent.
U||La seule partie du programme qui soit appliquée complètement est celle de la Non-Violence. Mais je regrette d’être forcé de l’avouer: même celle-ci n’est pas appliquée selon l’esprit du livre. Si elle l’était l’Inde pourrait obtenir son Swaraj en une journée. Si l’Inde adoptait la doctrine de l’amour comme faisant partie de sa religion et l’introduisait dans sa politique le Swaraj descendrait des Cieux. Mais j’ai tristement conscience que cet événement est encore bien éloigné de nous.
U||Je fais part de ces réflexions parce que je remarque que bien des citations du livre sont données dans l’intention de jeter un discrédit sur le mouvement actuel. J’ai même lu des articles où il est suggéré que je joue un jeu habile et que je profite de l’agitation actuelle pour imposer mes manies à l’Inde et que je fais des expériences religieuses à ses dépens. Tout ce que je puis répondre c’est que le Satyâgraha est d’une étoffe plus résistante. Il n’y a en lui rien de réticent et rien de caché. Il est certain qu’une partie de la théorie de l’existence décrite dans Hind Swaraj est mise en pratique. Il n’y aurait pas le moindre danger à ce que la totalité le fût. Mais il n’est pas juste d’effrayer les gens en reproduisant certains passages qui n’ont rien à voir avec la question actuelle intéressant le pays.

U||A SON ALTESSE ROYALE LE DUC DE CONNAUGHT
U||Monsieur,—Votre Altesse a sans doute beaucoup entendu parler de la Non-Coopération et des Non-Coopérateurs et de leurs méthodes, et incidemment de moi, qui en suis l’humble auteur. Je crains que les renseignements communiqués à votre Altesse ne lui aient montré qu’un côté de la question. Je lui dois, je dois à mes amis et je me dois à moi-même de lui mettre sous les yeux ce qui constitue pour moi la portée de la Non-Coopération telle qu’elle est appliquée non seulement par moi mais par mes plus intimes collaborateurs tels que MM. Shaukat Ali et Mahomed Ali.
U||Ce n’est pour moi ni une joie ni un plaisir de m’occuper activement de boycotter la visite de Votre Altesse. Pendant une période ininterrompue de trente années j’ai loyalement et volontairement servi le gouvernement parce que j’avais la conviction absolue que c’était le moyen d’obtenir la liberté de mon pays. Ce ne fut pas une chose de peu d’importance pour moi lorsque je dus suggérer à mes compatriotes de ne prendre aucune part à la réception de votre Altesse. Nul parmi nous ne lui reproche rien en tant que gentleman anglais. Sa personne nous est aussi sacrée 170 que celle de notre plus cher ami. Je ne connais pas un seul de mes amis qui ne risquerait sa vie pour sauver celle de votre Altesse si elle était en danger.
U||Nous ne sommes pas en guerre contre les Anglais individuellement. Nous ne cherchons pas à détruire la vie Anglaise mais nous voulons détruire le système qui a émasculé le corps, l’esprit, et l’âme de notre pays. Nous sommes résolus à lutter de toute notre puissance contre ce qui dans la nature anglaise a permis au Pendjab le Dyerisme et le O’ Dwyerisme et abouti à un affront gratuit envers l’Islam, religion pratiquée par 70 millions des habitants de l’Inde. Nous considérons comme incompatible avec notre respect de nous-mêmes de supporter plus longtemps qu’on nous écrase d’une supériorité et d’une domination qui ignorent et méprisent systématiquement les sentiments de 300 millions d’innocents Indiens sur mainte importante question. C’est chose humiliante pour nous. Et ce ne peut-être pour vous un sujet de fierté de savoir que 300 millions d’Indiens vivent dans la crainte continuelle de 100 000 Anglais et que par suite ils leur soient asservis.
U||Votre Altesse vient non pour mettre fin au système que je viens de décrire mais pour le faire subsister et en augmenter le prestige. Ses premières paroles ont été à la louange de Lord Willingdon. J’ai l’honneur de le connaître, je le crois homme aimable et honnête, incapable de faire volontairement du mal à une mouche mais ayant échoué absolument dans ses fonctions de gouverneur. Il s’est laissé influencer par ceux qui avaient intérêt à soutenir le pouvoir. Il ne devine pas ce qui se passe dans l’esprit de la province Dravidian. Ici, au Bengale vous donnez un 171 certificat de mérite à un gouverneur qui est également, si j’en juge par ce que j’ai entendu dire de lui, homme estimable mais qui ne connaît rien de l’âme du Bengale et de ses aspirations. Le Bengale n’est pas Calcutta. Fort William et les palais de Calcutta représentent une insolente exploitation des paysans extrêmement cultivés et résignés de cette province.
U||Les Non-Coopérateurs en sont arrivés à la conclusion qu’ils ne doivent pas se laisser duper par des Réformes faisant semblant de toucher au problème de la détresse et de l’humiliation de l’Inde. Il ne faut pas que dans notre colère impatiente nous ayons recours à la violence stupide. Nous admettons couramment que nous méritons notre part du blâme pour l’état de choses actuel. Notre coopération volontaire est tout aussi responsable de notre asservissement que les canons anglais.
U||Le fait de ne point participer à un chaleureux accueil de votre Altesse n’est donc pas de notre part une démonstration contre sa haute personnalité mais contre le système qu’elle est venue encourager. Je sais qu’il est impossible aux Anglais individuellement, même s’ils le désiraient, de changer la nature anglaise tout d’un coup. Si nous voulons être les égaux des Anglais, il faut que nous cessions d’avoir peur, il faut que nous apprenions à nous suffire, à être indépendants des écoles, des tribunaux, de la protection et du patronage d’un Gouvernement que nous désirons renverser s’il ne sait pas s’amender.
U||Voilà les raisons de la Non-Coopération non-violente. Je sais que nous ne sommes pas encore tous non-violents en parole et en actions mais les résultats 172 obtenus jusqu’ici ont été absolument surprenants. Le peuple a compris comme il ne l’avait jamais fait encore le secret de la Non-Violence et sa valeur. Qui veut voir peut se rendre compte que ce mouvement est religieux et purifiant. Nous abandonnons la boisson, nous cherchons à débarrasser l’Inde du fléau de l’intouchabilité; nous essayons de renoncer au faux luxe étranger et de faire revivre, en nous mettant au rouet l’antique et poétique simplicité de l’existence. Nous espérons ainsi rendre stériles les institutions malfaisantes qui existent.
U||Je demande à Son Altesse Royale en tant qu’Anglais d’étudier ce mouvement et ce qu’il peut faire pour l’Empire et pour le monde. Nous ne luttons contre rien de ce qui est bon. En protégeant l’Islam ainsi que nous le faisons, nous protégeons toutes les religions; en protégeant l’honneur de l’Inde, nous protégeons l’honneur de l’humanité. Les moyens que nous employons ne peuvent nuire à personne. Nous devons vivre amicalement avec les Anglais, mais notre amitié doit être celle de deux égaux en théorie et en pratique et nous devons continuer de non-coopérer c’est à dire de nous purifier jusqu’au jour où le but sera atteint. Je prie votre Altesse Royale, et par son intermédiaire tous les Anglais de prendre en considération le point de vue de la Non-Coopération.
U||Je suis le serviteur fidèle de Votre Altesse.
U||M. K. Gandhi.

U||BOYCOTTAGE SOCIAL
U||La Non-Coopération étant un mouvement de purification fait non seulement remonter à la surface toutes nos faiblesses mais il dévoile également ce qu’il y a d’excessif dans nos qualités mêmes. Le boycottage social est une antique institution, elle date de la même époque que les castes. C’est la seule sanction terrible qui produise un effet sérieux. Elle s’appuie sur l’idée qu’une communauté n’est pas tenue de donner l’hospitalité à un excommunié ni de le servir. Boycotter avait sa raison d’être lorsque chaque village formait un tout compact et qu’il n’y avait guère possibilité de se montrer récalcitrant. Mais lorsque l’opinion n’est pas d’accord, comme c’est le cas actuellement sur les mérites de la Non-Coopération; lorsqu’on fait l’essai d’une nouvelle méthode, le boycottage social qui cherche à faire plier la minorité devant la volonté de la majorité est une forme de violence impardonnable. Si l’on persiste, ce boycottage deviendra la ruine du 
U||mouvement. Le boycottage social est applicable et produit son effet lorsqu’il n’est pas considéré comme une punition et qu’il est accepté par celui qui en souffre comme une forme de discipline. En outre pour qu’on le tolère dans une campagne non-violente il ne doit jamais être inhumain. 174 Il faut qu’il soit civilisé. S’il est une source de désagréments pour celui qui en est l’objet, il faut qu’il soit une source de chagrin pour celui qui l’applique. Priver un malade des soins du docteur par exemple comme ce fut, paraît-il, le cas à Jhansi est un acte inhumain comparable selon le code moral à une tentative de meurtre. Je ne vois aucune différence entre assassiner quelqu’un et priver un mourant du secours d’un docteur. Même les lois de la guerre ordonnent, je le sais, de donner des soins médicaux à l’ennemi lorsqu’il en a besoin. Empêcher quelqu’un de se servir du seul puits qui existe dans un village c’est lui intimer l’ordre de partir. Les Non-Coopérateurs n
U||’ont sûrement pas le droit d’employer une pression de ce genre envers ceux qui ne voient pas les choses tout à fait de la même façon qu’eux. L’impatience et l’intolérance tueraient certainement ce grand mouvement religieux. Nous n’avons pas le droit de contraindre les gens à être purs, nous avons encore moins le droit de les forcer par la violence à respecter notre opinion. Ceci est absolument contraire à l’esprit démocratique que nous voulons développer.
U||Il est certain qu’il y a de sérieuses difficultés à surmonter. Recourir au boycottage social est une tentation irrésistible lorsque celui qui a accepté l’arbitrage privé refuse de se soumettre à sa sentence. Il est facile néanmoins de se rendre compte que le boycottage social a neuf chances sur dix d’entraver le splendide mouvement vers l’arbitrage pour régler les litiges, arme puissante de la Non-Coopération qui tend en outre à faire beaucoup de bien. Il faudra un certain temps avant de s’habituer à l’arbitrage privé. Par sa simplicité et son économie, il répugne à 175 certains, comme les mets simples à ceux dont le palais est blasé par les mets trop épicés. Il va sans dire que toutes les sentences arbitrales ne seront pas parfaites; mais nous devons compter pour qu’il prospère sur le mérite intrinsèque du mouvement, et la justesse des décisions...
U||J’espère que ceux qui travaillent à la Non-Coopération se méfieront des embûches du boycottage social. Mais le boycottage n’a certainement pas comme alternative des rapports sociaux. Un homme qui défie une opinion publique nette et vigoureuse sur des questions vitales n’a droit ni à des politesses ni à des privilèges sociaux. Nous ne devons pas prendre part chez lui à des réunions telles que repas de noce, et recevoir de lui des cadeaux, mais nous ne nous permettrions pas de lui refuser un service social. Ce service serait un devoir pour nous. Assister à de grands dîners et autres choses du même genre c’est un privilège qu’on est libre d’accorder ou de refuser. Il serait sage de notre part de prêcher plutôt par excès de zèle et de nous servir de notre arme dans certaines occasions rares et bien déterminées sous la forme restreinte dont je viens de parler. En chaque circonstance celui qui emploie cette arme le fait à ses propres risques. S’en servir n’est en aucune façon
U|| un devoir pour l’instant. Personne n’a le droit d’en faire usage s’il y a quelque danger de nuire par là au mouvement.

U||MON INCONSÉQUENCE
U||Un correspondant me pose quelques questions pleines d’à-propos sur un ton mordant:
U||«Lorsque les Zoulous, m’écrit-il, se sont soulevés contre les usurpateurs britanniques afin d’obtenir leur liberté, vous avez aidé les Anglais à apaiser la soi-disant révolte. Est-ce se révolter que de chercher à se libérer du joug de l’étranger? Jeanne d’Arc était-elle une rebelle? De Valera en est-il un? Vous répondrez sans doute que les Zoulous avaient recours à la violence. Je vous demanderai alors: Qu’est-ce qui était mauvais, la fin ou des moyens? Si les moyens étaient mauvais, la fin ne l’était certes pas. Auriez-vous la bonté de m’expliquer cette énigme. Pendant la récente guerre vous avez enrôlé des recrues pour que les Anglais se battent contre des nations qui n’avaient fait à l’Inde aucun mal. Dans une guerre entre deux races, avant de prendre parti pour l’une ou pour l’autre, il faudrait savoir les raisons de chacune. Nous n’avons eu qu’une seule version et celle d’une nation qui n’a certes pas la réputation d’être sincère ni franche. Vous
U|| vous êtes toujours montré l’avocat de la Résistance passive et de la Non-Violence. Pourquoi donc avez-vous alors engagé les gens à prendre part à une guerre dont ils ignoraient les mérites et 177 pour l’accroissement d’une race qui se vautre dans le bourbier de l’Impérialisme? Vous direz peut-être que vous aviez confiance dans la bureaucratie britannique. Comment quelqu’un peut-il avoir la moindre confiance en un peuple étranger dont chaque action dément les promesses qu’il a faites? Avec vos connaissances étendues ce ne peut être votre cas. Voulez-vous me donner la réponse à cette seconde énigme?
U||«Il est un autre point dont je voudrais parler. Vous êtes un avocat de la Non-Violence. Dans les circonstances actuelles, nous devions être absolument non-violents. Mais lorsque l’Inde sera libre, faudra-t-il complètement renoncer à employer les armes, même si une nation étrangère venait nous envahir? Continuerez-vous à boycotter les chemins de fer, les télégraphes, les navires même lorsque ceux-ci auront cessé de servir à l’exportation des produits de notre sol?»
U||Je lis et j’entends beaucoup d’accusations sur mon inconséquence mais je n’y réponds pas, car elles n’affectent que moi. Les questions soulevées par mon correspondant actuel sont d’importance générale et méritent qu’on s’y arrête. Elle sont loin d’être nouvelles mais je ne me souviens pas d’y avoir répondu dans la Jeune Inde.
U||Non seulement j’ai offert mes services pendant la guerre des Zoulous, mais auparavant pendant la guerre des Boers, et pendant la récente guerre, non seulement j’ai fait une campagne de recrutement mais en 1914 j’ai formé un corps d’ambulanciers. Par conséquent, si j’ai péché, la coupe de mes péchés est pleine jusqu’au bord. Je n’ai jamais négligé l’occasion à n’importe quelle époque de 178 servir le gouvernement. Pendant ces heures de crises deux questions se posaient à moi: Quel était mon devoir de citoyen de l’Empire ainsi que je croyais l’être alors et quel était mon devoir de croyant profondément sincère en Ahimsa (Non-Violence)?
U||Je sais à présent que je me trompais en me considérant comme un citoyen de l’Empire, mais, dans chacune des quatre circonstances, je croyais que malgré les nombreuses incapacités dont souffrait mon pays, celui-ci marchait vers la liberté, que, tout bien considéré, le gouvernement, d’après l’opinion courante, n’était pas absolument mauvais et que si les administrateurs anglais se montraient insulaires et stupides ils n’en étaient pas moins sincères.
U||Telle étant ma manière de voir, je fis ce que tout Anglais eût fait à ma place dans les mêmes circonstances. Je n’avais ni l’intelligence ni l’importance nécessaires pour agir seul. Je n’avais pas à juger ou à étudier de près les décisions ministérielles avec la solennité d’un tribunal. Je n’imputai aucune mauvaise intention aux ministres à l’époque de la guerre des Boers, de la révolte des Zoulous ou de la guerre récente. Je ne considérais pas que les Anglais fussent meilleurs ou pires que le reste des humains pas plus que je ne les considère meilleurs ou pires actuellement. Je les considérais et je les considère encore, capables comme n’importe quel groupe d’hommes de mobiles et d’actes élevés et capables également de se tromper. Je jugeais donc qu’en offrant mes humbles services à l’Empire à l’heure où celui-ci en avait besoin, que ce fût d’une façon générale ou locale, je remplissais mon devoir d’homme et de citoyen. Et je compte que tout citoy
U||en devra agir ainsi envers son pays 179 sous le Swaraj. Je serais infiniment malheureux si chacun de nous érigeait sa loi individuelle en toute circonstance imaginable et allait peser sur des balances de précision et étudier au microscope chaque action de notre Assemblée Nationale. J’abandonnerai mon opinion sur la plupart des questions entre les mains des représentants de la Nation en choisissant ceux-ci avec le plus grand soin. Un gouvernement démocratique s’il en était autrement ne durerait pas une journée.
U||La situation est tout autre pour moi, à présent. J’imagine que mes yeux se sont ouverts. L’expérience m’a rendu plus sage. Je considère que le système de gouvernement que nous avons actuellement est absolument mauvais et que pour l’abolir ou le transformer la nation doit faire tous les efforts possibles; il n’a pas en lui ce qu’il faut pour se perfectionner lui-même. Je suis toujours persuadé que beaucoup d’administrateurs anglais sont sincères, mais cela ne m’avance guère car je considère qu’ils s’abusent autant que je le faisais moi-même et sont aussi aveugles que je l’étais. De sorte que je n’éprouve aucune fierté à appartenir à l’Empire ou à m’en déclarer citoyen. Je me rends parfaitement compte au contraire que je ne suis qu’un paria «intouchable» de l’Empire. Je dois donc prier sans cesse pour obtenir sa destruction ou sa reconstruction, de même qu’un paria aurait le droit de demander la destruction ou la reconstruction de l’Hindouisme ou de la s
U||ociété hindoue.
U||Le point suivant de Ahimsa est le plus difficile à expliquer. Ma façon de concevoir Ahimsa me pousse toujours à me détacher de presque toutes les sphères 180 d’action dont je m’occupe. Mon âme refuse d’être satisfaite tant qu’elle reste le témoin impuissant d’un seul tort ou d’une seule misère. Mais il m’est impossible à moi, pauvre être fragile et faible, de réparer toutes les injustices et de me considérer exempt de blâme dans le mal que je vois. L’esprit chez moi m’entraîne d’un côté, le corps de l’autre. On peut se libérer de l’influence de ces deux forces mais on n’y arrive que par étapes lentes et pénibles. Ce n’est point par le refus machinal d’agir que j’obtiendrai la liberté mais par une action indépendante et intelligente. Cette lutte entre le corps et l’âme pour que l’âme devienne absolument libre entraîne une crucifixion incessante de la chair.
U||J’étais un citoyen comme les autres, mon intelligence n’était nullement supérieure; je croyais, moi, en Ahimsa et eux n’y croyaient pas. Poussés par la colère et par la rancune, ils refusaient de faire leur devoir et d’aider le gouvernement; ils refusaient parce qu’ils étaient faibles et ignorants. Travaillant avec eux j’avais le devoir de les guider. Je leur montrai donc quel était leur devoir précis, je leur expliquai la doctrine d’Ahimsa et les laissai choisir. C’est ce qu’ils ont fait. Je ne me repens pas de mon action, car sous le Swaraj également je n’hésiterais pas à conseiller à ceux qui auraient le désir de prendre les armes de se battre pour leur pays.

U||INSTRUCTIONS AUX PAYSANS DES PROVINCES UNIES
U||Aperçu des instructions en hindi adressées par M. Gandhi aux paysans des Provinces Unies pendant sa visite à Oudh.
U||Il est absolument impossible d’obtenir le Swaraj et la réparation des injustices commises si les règles suivantes ne sont pas strictement observées.
U||1o Nous ne devons faire de mal à personne. Nous ne devons frapper personne de notre bâton; nous ne devons pas employer de langage insultant ou exercer de pression indue sur personne.
U||2o Nous ne devons pas piller les boutiques.
U||3o Nous devons agir sur notre adversaire par notre bonté, non le contraindre par la force brutale ou lui supprimer sa provision d’eau le priver des services du barbier ou du blanchisseur.
U||4o Nous ne devons pas refuser de payer nos impôts au Gouvernement ni notre loyer à notre propriétaire.
U||5o S’il arrivait qu’on eût quelque chose à reprocher aux zamindars il faudrait en informer Pundit Motilal Nehru et suivre ses conseils.
U||6o Il faut se rappeler que nous voulons que les Zamindars deviennent nos amis.
U||182
U||7o Nous ne cherchons pas en ce moment à désobéir civilement et devons par conséquent obéir à tous les ordres du gouvernement.
U||8o Nous ne devons pas arrêter les trains et y monter sans billet.
U||9o Au cas où l’un de nos chefs serait arrêté nous ne devons pas nous opposer à son arrestation, ni occasionner de désordre. Notre cause ne sera pas ruinée parce que le Gouvernement aura arrêté nos chefs, mais elle le sera certainement si nous perdons la tête et commettons des actes violents.
U||10o Il faut supprimer les boissons alcooliques, les stupéfiants et autres vices.
U||11o Il faut traiter toutes les femmes comme si elles étaient nos mères, nos sœurs, les respecter et les protéger.
U||12o Il faut encourager l’union des Hindous et des Musulmans.
U||13o Nous ne devons pas faire de distinction entre les Hindous ni considérer que certains sont inférieurs ou intouchables. L’esprit d’égalité et de fraternité doit régner parmi tous. Nous devons considérer tous les habitants de l’Inde comme des frères et des sœurs.
U||14o Nous ne devons pas jouer.
U||15o Nous ne devons pas voler.
U||16o Nous ne devons pas mentir quelle qu’en soit la raison. Nous devons être loyaux dans toutes nos transactions.
U||17o Nous devons introduire le rouet dans chaque intérieur et tous, hommes et femmes, consacrer une partie de notre temps à filer, apprendre aux enfants et les encourager à filer quatre heures par jour.
U||18o Nous devons éviter d’employer du tissu étranger 183 et porter des étoffes tissées par nos tisseurs et dont nous aurons filé le fil.
U||19o Nous devons faire juger nos querelles par arbitrage et ne pas nous adresser aux tribunaux.
U||La chose la plus importante dont il faut nous souvenir c’est de maîtriser notre colère, de ne jamais avoir recours à la violence et même de supporter que l’on soit violent à notre égard.

U||HUMANITÉ CONTRE PATRIOTISME
U||Un ami qui m’est cher attire mon attention sur ce qu’il considère comme un appel malencontreux au patriotisme des Sikhs plutôt qu’à leur humanité, dans la lettre que je leur ai adressée. Voici le paragraphe qui lui déplaît: «Le moyen le plus pur de chercher à obtenir justice pour les meurtres commis est de ne pas le chercher. Ceux qui les ont perpétrés, qu’ils soient Sikhs, Pathans ou Hindous sont des compatriotes. Leur châtiment ne rendra pas la vie aux morts. Je voudrais prier ceux dont le cœur est déchiré de leur pardonner, non parce qu’ils se sentent faibles (ils ont entre les mains tous les moyens de punir) mais parce qu’il n’y a pas 184 de borne à leur force. Ceux-là seuls qui ont conscience d’être forts peuvent pardonner.»
U||J’ai lu et relu ce qui précède, et je sais que si je devais écrire à nouveau cette même lettre, je n’en changerais pas un seul mot. Mon appel s’adresse aux Sikhs en tant qu’Indiens. Il me suffisait de restreindre sa portée à un point qu’ils pouvaient facilement comprendre. Le principal argument serait le même pour tous et à toutes les époques. La lettre que j’ai adressée aux Sikhs eût perdu de son poids si mon appel s’était étendu à l’humanité. Il faut démontrer à un Sikh cherchant à punir un criminel indien qui n’est pas Sikh, mais prêt à pardonner la même offense à un Sikh, qu’un Sikh et un Indien ne font qu’un dans les questions de ce genre. Mais on s’adresserait à l’humanité plutôt qu’au patriotisme s’il s’agissait d’un Indien et d’un Anglais.
U||Je dois avouer cependant que vu l’état d’esprit actuel un Anglais pouvait facilement se méprendre sur le sens de cette lettre. Pour moi Patriotisme et Humanité ne font qu’un. Je suis patriote parce que je suis homme et humain. L’un n’exclut pas l’autre. Je ne ferais de mal ni à l’Angleterre ni à l’Allemagne pour servir l’Inde. L’Impérialisme n’existe pas dans ma façon d’envisager la vie. La morale d’un patriote ne diffère pas de celle d’un patriarche. Un patriote l’est d’autant moins qu’il est tiède humanitaire. Il n’y a pas de conflit entre la morale politique et la morale privée. Un non-coopérateur agira exactement de la même façon envers son père et son fils qu’envers le gouvernement.

U||LE SATYAGRAHA. LA DÉSOBÉISSANCE CIVILE. LA RÉSISTANCE PASSIVE.
U||La tâche m’incombe souvent de répondre à des questions embarrassantes sur toutes sortes de sujets surgissant du grand mouvement de Non-Coopération. Un groupe d’étudiants non coopérateurs m’a prié de définir les termes que j’ai mis en tête de ces notes. Il arrive que même à cette heure tardive on me demande encore sérieusement si parfois le Satyagraha n’approuve pas la résistance par la force: dans le cas par exemple où la vertu d’une sœur se trouverait à la merci d’un homme affolé par sa passion. Je me suis permis de suggérer que la meilleure forme de défense serait de venir sans irritation se placer entre la victime et son agresseur et d’affronter la mort. J’ai ajouté que cette méthode nouvelle (pour l’assaillant,) éteindrait probablement le désir chez celui-ci de telle sorte qu’il ne chercherait plus à enlever une femme innocente mais dans sa honte aurait hâte de disparaître à sa vue, et que s’il en était autrement, l’acte de bravoure accompli par le fr
U||ère cuirasserait le cœur de la jeune femme et lui communiquerait une bravoure égale pour résister à la convoitise de l’homme transformé momentanément 186 en brute. Je croyais avoir fourni l’argument décisif en ajoutant que, s’il arrivait que la force physique l’emportât, la honte n’en retomberait pas sur la femme mais sur l’homme et que son frère et elle étant morts pour défendre sa vertu tous deux seraient en bonne posture devant le Tribunal Suprême. Je ne garantis point que mon argument ait convaincu celui qui m’avait posé la question, ni qu’il convaincra le lecteur. Le monde, je le sais bien, n’en continuera pas moins d’exister comme auparavant. Mais il est bien, en ce moment d’examen de conscience et de purification, de comprendre les conséquences du puissant mouvement de Non-Violence. Toutes les religions ont insisté sur l’idéal le plus haut, mais toutes ont fait des concessions aux faiblesses humaines.
U||Je vais maintenant résumer les explications que j’ai données des différents termes. Je suis incapable de donner des définitions à la fois exactes et concises.
U||Satyagraha veut dire littéralement: «se retenir» à la vérité et par conséquent signifie Force de Vérité. La Vérité c’est l’âme, l’esprit, donc c’est la force de l’âme. Elle exclut tout emploi de violence parce que l’homme ne saurait connaître la vérité absolue et par conséquent n’a pas qualité pour punir. Le mot fut créé par moi dans l’Afrique du Sud pour distinguer la Résistance Non-Violente des Indiens de l’Afrique du Sud de la résistance passive des Suffragettes et autres à la même époque. Elle n’est point conçue pour être l’arme des faibles.
U||La Résistance Passive dans le sens orthodoxe, comprend aussi bien le mouvement pour le Suffrage des femmes que la résistance des Non-Conformistes. 187 Tout en évitant la violence, qui est impossible aux faibles, elle ne l’exclut pas si, de l’avis de celui qui fait acte de Résistance Passive, la circonstance le demande. Néanmoins la Résistance Passive est toujours distinguée de la résistance armée, et à une certaine époque seuls les martyrs chrétiens l’appliquaient.
U||La Désobéissance Civile est une infraction civile à des décrets sans morale que la loi a établis. Cette expression, si je ne me trompe, fut créée par Thoreau pour représenter sa propre résistance aux lois d’un état esclavagiste. Il a laissé un traité parfait sur le devoir de Désobéissance Civile. Mais Thoreau n’était peut-être pas un champion absolu de la Non-Violence. Il est probable également que l’infraction de Thoreau aux lois établies se limitait à celles qui se rapportaient aux finances c’est à dire au payement des impôts; alors que l’expression Désobéissance Civile ainsi qu’elle fut appliquée en 1919 signifiait infraction à toute loi établie et immorale. De la part de celui qui résistait, elle signifiait qu’il se mettait hors la loi d’une façon civile, c’est à dire non-violente. Ayant appelé les sanctions de la loi il subissait gaîment l’emprisonnement. C’est une des branches du Satyagraha.
U||La Non-Coopération signifie avant tout le refus de coopérer avec l’Etat qui, dans l’opinion du Non-Coopérateur, est devenu corrompu. Elle exclut la Désobéissance Civile du genre de celle qui est décrite plus haut. Par sa nature même, la Non-Coopération est à la portée d’enfants intelligents et peut sans danger être appliquée par les masses. La Désobéissance Civile suppose une habitude d’obéissance volontaire 188 aux lois, sans crainte de leurs sanctions. Elle ne peut donc être mise en pratique qu’en dernier ressort et par quelques uns, au début tout au moins. La Non-Coopération et la désobéissance civile font, l’une et l’autre, partie du Satyagraha qui comprend toutes les formes de résistance non-violente employées pour la défense de la Liberté.

U||AUX PARSIS
U||Chers amis,
U||Je sais que vous suivez avec beaucoup d’intérêt le mouvement de Non-Coopération. Vous n’ignorez probablement pas que tous les Non-Coopérateurs réfléchis attendent anxieusement de savoir le rôle que vous allez jouer dans le mouvement de purification qui s’étend sur le pays tout entier. Personnellement, je suis persuadé que vous ferez ce que vous devez faire lorsque le moment sera venu de prendre une décision et si je vous écris ces quelques lignes, c’est que je crois le moment arrivé.
U||Des liens sacrés outre celui de compatriote, m’unissent à vous. Dadabhai fut le premier patriote qui m’inspira. A une époque où je ne connaissais 189 pas d’autres chefs il fut mon guide et mon soutien. Encore enfant, j’eus pour lui une lettre d’introduction. Ce fut l’ancien «roi sans couronne» de Bombay qui en 1896 me servit de maître et me montra la façon de travailler. Déjà en 1892, alors que je voulais livrer bataille à un agent politique ce fut lui qui réprima mon ardeur juvénile et me donna ma première leçon d’Ahimsa dans la vie publique. Il m’apprit à ne pas m’irriter des injustices qui m’étaient faites si je voulais servir l’Inde. Un commerçant Parsi de Durban, Rustamjee Ghorkhodoo, fut dans l’Afrique du Sud un de mes meilleurs clients et un de mes amis. Il donna largement pour le bien public, lui et son courageux fils, et furent parmi mes premiers compagnons de prison.
U||Il m’offrit asile lorsqu’on me lyncha, et à l’heure actuelle, suit avec un profond intérêt la cause du Swaraj et vient de me donner pour elle 40000 roupies. La plus noble femme de l’Inde est à mon avis une Parsie; elle a la douceur d’un agneau et son cœur embrasse toute l’humanité. Son amitié est le plus précieux des privilèges. Je voudrais continuer à citer indéfiniment ces souvenirs sacrés mais je vous en ai assez dit pour que vous me compreniez et appréciiez les raisons qui ont dicté cette lettre.
U||Votre communauté est très prudente, vous êtes étroitement unis et vous demandez avec juste raison d’abondantes preuves de la moralité et de la sécurité d’un mouvement avant de vous y intéresser. Mais vous risquez maintenant de pécher par excès de prudence et vos succès commerciaux peuvent vous porter à oublier les besoins et les aspirations de la masse de vos compatriotes.
U||190
U||J’appréhende pour vous l’esprit de Rockfeller qui semble gagner l’importante maison des Tatas. Je n’ose penser aux conséquences de s’approprier comme ils le font les biens des pauvres gens pour transformer l’Inde en pays industriel, bénéfice douteux pour elle, mais je suis persuadé que ce n’est qu’une phase passagère. Votre pénétration vous permettra de voir qu’une telle entreprise est un suicide. Votre intelligence alerte vous démontrera que ce n’est pas de la concentration du capital entre les mains d’un petit nombre que l’Inde a besoin, mais de la distribution de ce capital afin qu’il soit à la portée des 750.000 villages composant ce continent d’environ 2700 kilomètres sur 2200 de superficie. Je sais par conséquent que c’est uniquement une question de temps et que vous joindrez votre sort comme communauté à celui des réformateurs souhaitant libérer l’Inde du fléau de l’Impérialisme qui la saigne à mort.
U||Il y a cependant une chose pour laquelle il serait criminel de ne pas agir immédiatement. Une vague de tempérance s’étend sur l’Inde. Le peuple désire volontairement s’abstenir de boissons alcoolisées. Or un grand nombre de Parsis gagnent leur vie comme tenanciers de débits de boisson. Votre coopération sincère peut anéantir complètement un grand nombre de ces lieux infects qui se trouvent dans la Présidence de Bombay. Les gouvernements locaux cherchent partout dans l’Inde à entraver honteusement cette tentative qui risque de supprimer tous les revenus publics d’Abkari. Désirez-vous aider le gouvernement ou désirez-vous aider le peuple? Le gouvernement de Bombay n’a pas encore été pris 191 de panique, mais je ne puis m’imaginer qu’il ait la sagesse ou le courage de sacrifier ce que la boisson rapporte au fisc. Il vous faut choisir immédiatement. J’ignore ce que disent les livres saints à ce sujet. Je puis m’imaginer ce qu’a dit le Prophète qui, séparant le bien du ma
U||l, chantait la victoire du Bien. Mais, en dehors de votre croyance religieuse, il faut que vous décidiez si vous allez aider la cause de la tempérance ou attendre apathiquement et philosophiquement ce qu’il adviendra. Je veux espérer qu’étant une communauté pratique de l’Inde vous allez vous associer activement et sérieusement au grand mouvement de tempérance qui promet de dépasser en éclat tous les mouvements analogues du monde entier.
U||Croyez moi, votre fidèle ami,
U||M. K. Gandhi.
U||23 mars 1921.
U||SEMAINE DU SATYAGRAHA
U||Le 6 et le 13 Avril approchent. Le 6 vit le réveil de l’Inde, le 13 fut un dimanche de deuil où une tentative diabolique eut lieu pour écraser l’esprit d’une nation qui venait de prendre conscience d’elle-même. 192 L’Inde observa dignement l’an dernier l’anniversaire de ces deux jours et la semaine entière qui suivit le 6 avril fut une semaine de commémoration. Il faut espérer qu’Avril prochain nous trouvera prêts à une commémoration plus grande encore... A maintes reprises la nation a affirmé sa résolution de faire réparer les injustices commises au Pendjab et au Califat et d’établir le Swaraj. Le Congrès de décembre est allé plus loin encore et a déclaré qu’il avait l’intention d’obtenir le Swaraj dans le courant de l’année.
U||Nous ne saurions donc mieux faire que de chercher à y parvenir en dirigeant tous nos efforts vers ce but. Le boycottage des tribunaux et des écoles se poursuit. Six points nécessitent un effort plus grand.
U||Il nous faut d’abord acquérir plus d’empire sur nous-mêmes afin d’arriver à une atmosphère de calme absolu, de paix et de bienveillance. Nous devons demander pardon de toute parole cruelle et irréfléchie que nous avons pu prononcer ou de toute action malveillante que nous avons pu faire.
U||Secondement, il nous faut encore davantage purifier notre cœur, et Hindous et Musulmans doivent cesser de soupçonner les raisons qui les font agir. Nous devons arriver à nous considérer comme incapables de nous faire tort les uns aux autres.
U||Troisièmement, il faut que nous autres Hindous ne considérions personne comme notre inférieur, comme digne de mépris, comme souillé et que par conséquent nous cessions de traiter les Parias d’«intouchables.»
U||Ces trois questions dépendent d’une formation intérieure 193 et le résultat obtenu se montrera dans nos rapports journaliers.
U||Le quatrième point est le fléau de la boisson. L’Inde semble heureusement avoir pris spontanément et volontairement la résolution de s’en délivrer. Il faut cette semaine concentrer nos efforts pour obtenir que les vendeurs renoncent à leurs licences, et les habitués des débits à leur habitude de boire. Chaque caste connaît ses coupables et mieux que personne peut exercer une influence sur eux. J’ai suggéré cependant aux femmes d’Ahmedabad d’organiser des ligues de tempérance et d’aller trouver les marchands et les buveurs. En tout cas aucune force physique ne doit être employée pour atteindre ce but; une campagne résolue et pacifique de persuasion doit réussir.
U||Le cinquième point est l’introduction du rouet dans chaque intérieur; qu’une quantité supérieure de khadi soit fabriquée et employée et que l’on cesse complètement d’utiliser les tissus étrangers.
U||Le sixième et dernier point est d’organiser des souscriptions régulières d’une façon systématique, afin de recueillir des ressources pour le «Fonds Tilak pour le Swaraj». Un effort soutenu dans cette direction devrait nous permettre de réunir 10 millions de roupies pendant cette semaine du Satyagraha. Mes voyages continuels m’ont convaincu que l’Inde est prête à donner beaucoup plus; seulement nous manquons de quêteurs. Chaque province de l’Inde devrait s’organiser pour remplir cette tâche pendant la semaine du Satyagraha. Les six points furent adoptés par le Congrès.
U||Les Hartal sont devenus trop fréquents, ils s’organisent 194 facilement et par conséquent ont perdu de leur valeur première. Un hartal aurait néanmoins une valeur particulière le 6 et le 13 et je le conseillerais certainement pendant ces deux jours mais sans en faire une obligation. Les employés des filatures ou d’ailleurs ne devraient cesser le travail que s’ils en ont obtenu la permission et aucune pression ne devrait être exercée sur l’administration des tramways. Nous devons compter sur le peuple pour qu’il ne se serve pas des voitures publiques pendant ces deux jours sans raison majeure. Ces deux jours devraient être employés à des prières et à des dévotions particulières.
U||Je voudrais dissuader le public de prendre des résolutions au sujet de nos demandes. La semaine de consécration doit être une semaine d’examen de conscience et de purification. De notre action dépend le but désiré. Lorsque nous nous en serons rendus dignes personne ne pourra nous empêcher d’établir le Swaraj et d’obtenir la réparation des deux grandes injustices.
U||23 mars 1921.
U||LA CONSTITUTION DU CONGRÈS
U||Le dernier Congrès a établi une Constitution, qui semble destinée à aboutir au Swaraj. Elle a pour 195 but de s’assurer dans chaque partie de l’Inde un Comité représentatif agissant d’accord avec une organisation centrale à laquelle il se soumet volontairement: le Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde. Elle établit le suffrage des adultes des deux sexes. Deux conditions seulement sont indispensables pour être électeur: avoir adhéré à la doctrine et payer une somme nominale de quatre annas. Elle veut s’assurer une représentation effective de tous les partis et de toutes les associations. Par conséquent cette constitution devrait être capable, si elle est organisée loyalement et si elle impose la confiance et le respect, de renverser le gouvernement. Celui-ci n’a aucun pouvoir en dehors de la coopération volontaire ou forcée du peuple. La force qu’il exerce c’est notre peuple qui la lui donne presque entièrement. Sans notre appui, 100.000 Européens ne pourraient même pas ten
U||ir la septième partie de nos villages, et il serait difficile à un seul homme, même s’il était présent, d’imposer sa volonté à, disons, quatre cents hommes et femmes, population moyenne d’un village indien.
U||La question que nous avons devant nous est par conséquent d’opposer notre volonté à celle du gouvernement ou en d’autres termes de lui retirer notre coopération. Si nous nous montrons fermes et unis dans notre intention le gouvernement sera forcé de plier devant notre volonté ou de disparaître. Pour consolider son pouvoir le gouvernement profite de ce qui cause les troubles. Lorsque nous sommes violents il a recours au terrorisme, lorsque nous sommes désunis il essaye de nous corrompre, lorsque nous sommes unis il cherche à nous attirer par des cajoleries et se montre conciliant, lorsque nous réclamons 196 il met des tentations sur la route de celui qui crie le plus fort. Nous n’avons donc qu’à rester non-violents, unis et ne pas céder à la corruption ou aux cajoleries.
U||Une longue préparation n’est pas nécessaire pour qu’un peuple cultivé et intelligent l’accomplisse. Il n’est pas difficile de lui mettre entre les mains un but et un programme communs. Seulement il ne s’agit pas de parler mais d’agir et d’organiser. Je proposerais donc qu’on s’efforçât de réunir avant le 30 juin le nom d’au moins dix millions de membres dans le Congrès. Aucune inscription ne serait valable sans le payement des 4 annas et l’adhésion à la doctrine. Nous devons essayer d’obtenir l’adhésion de tous les adultes d’une même famille et mettre notre fierté à avoir sur nos listes autant de noms de femmes que de noms d’hommes. Nous devons nous efforcer de persuader à tous les Musulmans, à toutes les castes, à tous les artisans et à tous les parias de signer. Alors ce registre électoral sera le plus démocratique du monde entier.
U||Si les propositions que j’ai faites obtiennent l’assentiment général il faut concentrer nos efforts jusqu’au 30 Juin pour obtenir:
U||1o Dix millions de roupies pour le «fonds Tilak pour le Swaraj».
U||2o Dix millions de membres pour le registre électoral du Congrès.
U||3o L’introduction du rouet dans deux millions de familles.
U||Pour recueillir les noms de dix millions de membres, j’estime qu’il faudra que nous nous adressions au moins à deux millions de familles comptant au 197 moins cinq personnes. Les travailleurs pour la cause peuvent certainement persuader aux familles des membres du Congrès de posséder un rouet chacune. Deux millions cinq cent mille rouets pour 21 provinces n’est pas une ambition tellement démesurée.
U||Ne gaspillons pas nos forces à réfléchir à trop de problèmes nationaux et à leurs solutions. Le malade qui essaye trop de remèdes à la fois meurt; un médecin qui expérimente sur son malade une combinaison de remèdes risque de perdre sa réputation et de passer pour un charlatan. Il est aussi nécessaire d’être chaste dans son travail que de l’être dans la vie; toute dissipation est mauvaise. Nous avons jusqu’à présent tiré chacun de notre côté et gaspillé de la façon la plus extravagante l’énergie nationale. Il est possible de boycotter le tissu étranger en une année. Il est aisé pour des travailleurs sincères de mettre en mouvement une organisation qui fonctionne. Si nous parvenons à recueillir, en nous y prenant avec méthode, dix millions de roupies nous ferons naître immédiatement la confiance; ce sera un témoignage tangible de notre détermination et de notre bonne foi.
U||Ce programme ne signifie point qu’il nous faille abandonner les autres activités de la Non-Coopération. Celles-ci se poursuivent. L’alcoolisme et l’intouchabilité doivent disparaître. Le mouvement pour l’éducation croît d’une façon régulière. Les institutions nationales qui ont pris naissance, si elles sont bien dirigées, continueront à s’étendre et attireront ceux des étudiants qui hésitent encore. Les avocats, classe toujours prudente et intéressée par éducation, suivront le mouvement dès qu’ils le verront progresser. Le boycottage des tribunaux par le public 198 avance d’une façon satisfaisante. A l’heure actuelle ces divers points ne demandent plus qu’une concentration d’effort général. Ils se rapportent à des classes particulières. Mais les trois choses dont j’ai parlé sont les plus importantes. Il faut qu’on s’en occupe maintenant; sinon le mouvement en tant que mouvement des masses est condamné à un échec.
U||30 mars 1921
U||LE DRAPEAU NATIONAL
U||Un drapeau est nécessaire à toute nation. Des milliers d’hommes ont donné leur vie pour lui. C’est assurément une des formes de l’idolâtrie qu’il serait mauvais de détruire. Un drapeau représente un idéal. L’Union Jack que l’on déploie évoque au cœur des Anglais des sentiments dont il serait difficile d’évaluer la force, les Stars and Stripes des Américains leur représentent un monde, l’étoile et le croissant font naître dans l’Islam la plus noble bravoure.
U||Nous aurons besoin également, nous autres Indiens: Hindous, Mahométans, Chrétiens, Juifs, et tous ceux dont l’Inde est le pays, d’un drapeau commun pour lequel nous serons prêts à vivre et à mourir.
U||..... C’est à un habitant du Pendjab, que revient 199 l’honneur d’avoir proposé un projet de drapeau digne d’arrêter l’attention. Lala Hansrag de Jullunder, en discutant l’avenir du Rouet, suggéra que celui-ci fût représenté sur le drapeau du Swaraj..... Je me rendis compte que le drapeau devait représenter les autres religions en même temps que la religion hindoue et l’Islam. L’Union Hindoue-Musulmane[79] n’est pas un terme qui exclut mais qui inclut, au contraire. Elle est le symbole de toutes les croyances de l’Inde..... Je proposai donc que le rouet fût représenté sur un fond blanc vert et rouge. La partie blanche représenterait toutes les autres religions et aurait, comme leur nombre est plus faible, la première place. La couleur de l’Islam viendrait ensuite et le rouge hindou en dernier pour indiquer que les plus forts doivent protéger les plus faibles. D’autre part, le blanc signifie pureté et paix... Et pour indiquer que le plus faible est l’égal du plus for
U||t les trois couleurs seraient réparties également.
U||200
U||Mais l’Inde en tant que nation ne saurait vivre et mourir que pour le rouet. Toute femme dira qu’avec le départ du rouet le bonheur de l’Inde et sa prospérité disparurent. Rien n’a réveillé les qualités de la femme et des masses comme l’appel du rouet. Les masses reconnaissent dans le rouet l’instrument qui assure l’existence, les femmes le considèrent comme le gardien de leur chasteté. Toutes les veuves que j’ai rencontrées retrouvent en lui un ami cher, longtemps 201 négligé. Le rétablir est l’unique moyen de nourrir des milliers de bouches affamées. Il n’existe pas de projet de développement industriel qui puisse résoudre le problème de la pauvreté croissante du paysan de l’Inde. L’Inde n’est pas une petite île, c’est un vaste continent qu’il est impossible de convertir comme l’Angleterre en pays industriel. Et nous devons résolument nous dresser contre toute tentative d’exploitation du monde extérieur. Notre seule planche de salut consiste à employer
U|| les heures 202 perdues de la nation à convertir notre coton en tissus dans nos chaumières. Le rouet est par conséquent aussi nécessaire à l’existence indienne que l’air et l’eau.
U||De plus les Musulmans lui accordent une place aussi importante que les Hindous. A la vérité les Musulmans s’y mettent même avec plus d’enthousiasme. La femme Musulmane est femme d’intérieur et peut à présent ajouter quelques sous aux maigres ressources que son mari apporte à la famille. Le rouet est donc en même temps le facteur commun le plus naturel et le plus important de l’existence nationale. Il nous sert à informer le monde qu’en ce qui concerne nos vêtements et notre nourriture, nous sommes résolus à ne dépendre que de nous-mêmes. Ceux qui partagent ma croyance vont se hâter de posséder un rouet et d’avoir un drapeau national comme je viens de le décrire.
U||Il va sans dire que le drapeau doit être en Khaddar car c’est par le tissu grossier que l’Inde restera indépendante des marchés étrangers. Je conseillerais à tous les groupements religieux, s’ils approuvent mon idée, de tisser dans l’angle gauche de leurs bannières un drapeau national minuscule. La dimension réglementaire du drapeau doit pouvoir contenir le dessin d’un rouet de grandeur naturelle.

U||LES BRUMES
U||Chaque fois que je vois mes amis se tromper sur le sens du mouvement je me répète à moi-même ces mots d’un hymne célèbre: «Nous nous connaîtrons mieux lorsque les brumes seront dispersées.» Un de mes amis vient de m’envoyer certains paragraphes sur la Non-Coopération parus dans le Servant of India du 14 courant. Vouloir expliquer les résolutions et raisons est une tâche si vaine! L’année passera vite et nos actions plus que nos paroles démontreront le sens de la Non-Coopération.
U||Pour moi la Non-Coopération n’est pas suspendue et ne le sera jamais tant que le gouvernement ne se sera pas purgé de la honte de ses crimes contre l’Inde, les Musulmans, et les habitants du Pendjab; et tant qu’il n’aura pas transformé son système pour répondre à la demande de la nation..... Il n’est guère besoin à présent de propagande verbale. L’exemple de ceux qui ont renoncé à leurs titres, à leurs écoles, à leurs tribunaux, à leurs conseils est une propagande plus efficace que le plus éloquent des discours. Les écoles nationales se multiplient... A mesure que les prudents et les timides se rendront compte que le mouvement de Non-Coopération est un effort sérieux et religieux et que les gens s’y intéressent 204 d’une façon permanente, eux aussi feront acte de renoncement.
U||Je ne serais pas surpris si l’histoire du mouvement dans l’Afrique du Sud se répétait aux Indes. Je serais même étonné s’il en était autrement. Le mouvement de l’Afrique du Sud débuta par un vote à l’unanimité. Dès qu’il fut entrepris, la majorité faiblit, 150 personnes seulement se montrèrent résolues à courir le risque d’être emprisonnées. Il y eut un accord, puis une nouvelle rupture et tout reprit à nouveau. Personne ne croyait, sauf quelques-uns parmi nous, que la réponse à notre appel viendrait à temps. Au commencement de la dernière phase, seize personnes furent emprisonnées. Alors ce fut un véritable assaut. La communauté entière s’élança comme une vague qui s’enfle. Sans organisation, sans propagande, 40000 personnes risquèrent la prison. On sait la suite, et que satisfaction entière fut accordée. Une révolution avait eu lieu sans que le sang fût versé; uniquement par une discipline énergique de souffrance personnelle.
U||Je me refuse à croire que l’Inde ne soit pas capable d’en faire autant. Rappelons ici les paroles de Lord Canning: «Sous le ciel bleu et serein de l’Inde un nuage gros comme le pouce peut paraître à l’horizon mais nul ne sait quelles proportions gigantesques il ne prendra pas tout à coup, ni quand il éclatera.» J’ignore à quel moment l’Inde agira d’un seul accord, mais je puis dire ceci: les classes cultivées auxquelles le Congrès s’est adressé répondront d’une façon digne de la nation probablement dans le courant de cette année.
U||Mais, quelle que soit leur attitude, le progrès de 205 la nation ne saurait dépendre d’une seule personne ou d’une seule classe. Les artisans sans éducation, les femmes, les hommes du peuple prennent part au mouvement. L’appel fait aux classes cultivées leur a préparé le chemin. Il fallait séparer les boucs des brebis. Il a fallu mettre à l’épreuve les classes cultivées. C’était à elles à donner l’exemple. La Non-Coopération a, Dieu merci, jusqu’à présent suivi son cours naturel.
U||La propagande du Swadeshi sous sa forme exclusive et intensive devait venir à son tour. Le Swadeshi faisait et fait partie du programme de Non-Coopération. Il en est à mon avis la partie la plus importante, la plus certaine et la plus sûre. Il était impossible de l’entreprendre plus tôt sous sa forme actuelle. Il fallait que, pour arriver au rouet, la voie fût libre devant le pays. Il fallait que celui-ci fût débarrassé de ses vieilles superstitions et de ses préjugés. Il fallait qu’il comprît l’inutilité de boycotter uniquement les marchandises anglaises et de boycotter toutes les marchandises étrangères. Il fallait qu’on lui eût montré qu’il avait perdu sa liberté en abandonnant le Swadeshi pour les tissus, et qu’il pouvait la reconquérir en se remettant à porter des vêtements dont l’étoffe était filée et tissée à la main,.. Il fallait qu’il se rendît compte que son épuisement ne provenait pas tant de l’armée qui la saigne que de la perte de cette industrie s
U||upplémentaire qui enlevait à l’Inde sa vitalité, et faisait de la famine un état chronique dans l’existence de l’Inde. Il fallait que dans chaque province se montrassent des hommes qui croyaient au rouet. Le peuple, alors ne pouvait faire autrement que d’apprécier la beauté et l’utilité du Khaddar.
U||206
U||Tout ceci est maintenant un fait accompli[80]. Les 207 dix millions d’hommes et de femmes et les dix millions de roupies sont indispensables pour faire revivre le Dharma[81] national.
U||Le problème ne consiste pas à trouver quelques charkas mais à les placer dans chacune des 10 millions de familles. Il consiste à fabriquer et à distribuer tout le tissu dont l’Inde a besoin. Ce n’est pas dix millions de roupies qui peuvent le faire. Mais si, avant le 30 juin, l’Inde est capable de trouver les 10 millions de roupies et les 10 millions d’hommes et de femmes et de distribuer dans autant de familles 2 millions de charkas marchant bien, elle est 208 presque capable d’obtenir le Swaraj, car l’effort accompli par le pays tout entier aura développé ces qualités qui rendent une nation bonne, grande, puissante et indépendante. Lorsque par un effort volontaire l’Inde sera parvenue à boycotter complètement le tissu étranger, elle sera prête pour le Swaraj. Je puis alors promettre que tous les forts des villes de l’Inde auront cessé d’être une insolente menace à sa liberté et deviendront des jardins où ses enfants joueront. Alors les rapports entre les Anglais et nous 
U||seront purifiés...
U||Les Anglais, s’ils le désirent, resteront aux Indes en amis et en égaux, avec le seul et unique but d’aider et de servir vraiment l’Inde. L’intention du mouvement de non-coopération est d’inviter les Anglais à coopérer avec nous à des conditions honorables ou à se retirer de notre pays. C’est un mouvement qui veut placer sur une base pure nos relations réciproques et les définir de façon à satisfaire notre respect de nous-mêmes et notre dignité. Donnez à ce mouvement le nom qu’il vous plaira; appelez-le Swadeshi et tempérance. Supposez, si vous voulez, que tous les mois passés ont été une perte d’énergie. Je propose au gouvernement et aux amis du parti modéré de coopérer avec la nation pour rendre le filage général et déclarer que l’alcoolisme est un crime. Aucun parti n’a besoin de se demander quel sera le résultat de ces deux mouvements. On jugera de l’arbre à ses fruits.

U||L’ÉDUCATION ANGLAISE
U||Un ami me demande de donner mon opinion réfléchie sur la valeur de l’éducation anglaise et d’expliquer les paroles que j’ai prononcées sur la grève à Cuttack..... Je consens avec plaisir à répondre à son désir.
U||A mon avis bien réfléchi l’éducation anglaise, par la méthode employée, a émasculé les Indiens qui l’ont reçue. Elle a causé à l’étudiant une tension nerveuse excessive et a fait de nous des imitateurs. La façon dont notre langue maternelle a été privée de la place qui lui appartient forme l’un des plus pénibles chapitres de l’histoire de nos rapports avec l’Angleterre. Ramo Hhan Rai aurait été un plus grand réformateur et Lokamania[82] Tilak[83] un plus grand 210 savant s’ils n’avaient été forcés de commencer avec le désavantage de penser en anglais et d’exprimer presque entièrement leurs idées dans cette langue. Leur influence sur le peuple, si merveilleuse soit-elle, eût été plus grande encore s’ils avaient été élevés sous un système moins contre-nature. Sans doute tous deux ont bénéficié de leur connaissance des riches trésors de la littérature anglaise, mais ceux-ci auraient dû leur être accessibles dans leur propre langue. Aucun pays ne peut d
U||evenir une nation s’il ne produit qu’une race de traducteurs. Songez à ce qui fût arrivé aux Anglais s’ils n’avaient eu de la Bible 211 une version autorisée. Je crois certainement que Chaitanya, Kabir, Nanak, Guru Govindsing, Sivaji et Pratap étaient de plus grands hommes que Ram Mohan Rai et Tilak. Je sais que toute comparaison est odieuse. Ils ont été également grands à leur façon.
U||Mais si l’on en juge d’après les résultats obtenus, l’influence de Ram Mohan et de Tilak sur les masses, n’est pas aussi durable et n’a pas une aussi grande portée que l’influence de ceux qui eurent le bonheur de naître à un meilleur moment. Si on les juge d’après les obstacles qu’ils eurent à surmonter, tous deux étaient des géants et ils seraient arrivés à des résultats 212 plus importants s’ils n’avaient été handicapés par leur éducation. Je me refuse à croire que le Raja et le Lokamanya n’auraient pas pensé les mêmes pensées s’ils avaient ignoré la langue anglaise. De toutes les superstitions dont souffre l’Inde, la plus grande est de croire que la connaissance de la langue anglaise est indispensable pour s’imprégner d’idées de liberté et pour développer la précision de la pensée. On devrait se souvenir que le pays depuis cinquante ans n’a eu à choisir qu’un seul système d’éducation, qu’un seul moyen d’expression lui a été imposé. I
U||l nous est donc impossible de prouver ce que nous aurions pu être si nous n’avions pas été instruits dans les écoles actuelles. Il est une chose que nous savons cependant. C’est que l’Inde est plus pauvre aujourd’hui qu’elle ne l’était il y a cinquante ans, qu’elle est moins capable de se défendre et que ses enfants sont moins vigoureux. Je n’ai pas besoin qu’on me dise que cela provient de notre système défectueux de gouvernement. Rien n’y est plus défectueux que sa méthode d’éducation. Elle a été conçue et elle est née dans l’erreur, les dirigeants anglais étant sincèrement persuadés que le système indigène était plus qu’inutile. Elle s’est développée dans le péché, car elle a eu pour tendance de rapetisser les Indiens de corps, d’esprit et d’âme.

U||LES CLASSES «SUPPRIMÉES»
U||M. Gandhi présida la Conférence des classes «supprimées» qui eut lieu à Ahmedabad les 13 et 14 courant. Quantité de personnes distinguées de la ville y assistaient; mais les intouchables étaient beaucoup moins nombreux qu’on ne l’avait espéré, le bruit ayant couru que le Gouvernement arrêterait ceux qui s’y rendraient.
U||M. Gandhi exprima d’abord ses regrets de voir un nombre si restreint d’intouchables et déclara que des incidents de ce genre lui faisaient perdre le peu de confiance qu’il avait dans les Conférences comme moyen actif de réforme sociale. Il ajouta que s’il retenait moins longuement ses auditeurs qu’ils ne s’y attendaient, ce serait parce que ses remarques ne s’adresseraient pas à tous ceux à qui il aurait voulu parler et non parce que son enthousiasme pour la cause était le moins du monde refroidi.
U||Passant au sujet de la Conférence il dit:
U||«J’ignore ce que je dois faire pour démontrer aux adversaires de la réforme qu’ils ont tort. Comment m’y prendre auprès de ceux qui considèrent tout contact avec les classes supprimées comme une souillure, s’ils croient ne pouvoir se purifier de cette souillure qu’en faisant certaines ablutions dont 214 l’omission serait par conséquent un péché? Je puis seulement leur faire part de mes convictions personnelles.
U||Je considère l’intouchabilité comme la plus grande tache de l’Hindouisme. Ce ne sont pas mes expériences pénibles en Sud-Afrique qui me l’ont fait mieux comprendre. Ce n’est point non plus parce que j’ai été autrefois agnostique. Il est faux également de croire comme certains, que mes opinions proviennent de l’étude que je fis de la littérature religieuse chrétienne. Ces opinions datent d’une époque lointaine où je n’étais ni versé dans la Bible ni épris d’elle et de ses disciples. Je n’avais pas douze ans lorsque j’y songeai pour la première fois. Un certain vidangeur nommé Uka venait à la maison vider les fosses. Il m’arriva souvent de demander à ma mère pourquoi c’était mal de le toucher, pourquoi on me le défendait. Si par hasard cela m’arrivait on m’ordonnait de faire des ablutions et, tout en obéissant naturellement, je n’en déclarais pas moins en souriant que l’intouchabilité n’était pas reconnue par la religion et qu’il était impossible
U|| qu’elle le fût. J’étais un enfant très soumis et respectueux et, autant que les égards dus à mes parents le permettaient, j’étais souvent en lutte ouverte avec eux à ce sujet. Je déclarais à ma mère qu’elle se trompait absolument lorsqu’elle considérait comme péché d’être en contact avec Uka.
U||A l’école il m’arrivait souvent de frôler les intouchables; et comme je ne voulais jamais m’en cacher à mes parents, ma mère me disait que le moyen le plus rapide de se purifier du contact était de toucher le premier musulman rencontré. Et par égard et respect pour ma mère, je le fis souvent, mais sans jamais 215 croire que ce fût une obligation religieuse. Un peu plus tard, nous partîmes pour Porbandar, où j’appris mes premiers éléments de Sanscrit. Je ne fréquentais pas une école anglaise. Nous fûmes confiés, mon frère et moi, à un Brahmane qui nous apprit Ramraksha et Vichnou Punjar. Les textes jale Vichnou stale Vichnou (Le Seigneur est présent dans l’eau, le Seigneur est présent sur terre) ne me sont jamais sortis de la mémoire. Une bonne vieille habitait tout près. Or, à cette époque, j’étais très craintif; et dès qu’il faisait nuit et que la lumière était éteinte, j’évoquais autour de moi les esprits et les démons. La bonne vieille pour calmer mes crain
U||tes me conseilla, lorsque j’avais peur, de réciter à voix basse le Ramraksha. Je suivis son conseil et m’en trouvai fort bien. Je n’ai jamais pu croire alors qu’aucun texte du Ramraksha traitât de péché le contact des intouchables. Je n’en comprenais pas le sens alors ou je le faisais très imparfaitement, mais j’étais sûr que le Ramraksha qui dissipait la crainte des esprits, n’eût pu admettre la crainte du contact des intouchables.
U||Nous lisions régulièrement le Ramraksha en famille. Un Brahmane du nom de Laha Maharaj nous le lisait. Il était frappé de la lèpre et il était convaincu que s’il lisait régulièrement le Ramayana il guérirait; et il le fut en effet. Comment, me disais-je, le Ramayana où l’un de ceux que l’on considère aujourd’hui comme intouchables fit traverser le Gange à Rama dans sa barque, peut-il admettre l’idée que des êtres humains sont intouchables sous prétexte que ce sont des âmes souillées? Le fait même que nous donnons à Dieu le nom de purificateur des impurs, 216 et autres noms semblables, ne montre-t-il pas que c’est un péché de considérer quiconque est né Hindou comme impur et intouchable, qu’il est satanique de le faire? Je n’ai jamais cessé depuis lors de répéter que c’était un grand péché. Je n’ai pas la prétention de dire que cette conviction était cristallisée lorsque j’avais douze ans mais je puis affirmer que je considérais alors l’intouchabilité 
U||comme péché. Je raconte ces détails pour les Vaishnavas et les Hindous orthodoxes.
U||J’ai toujours déclaré que j’étais un Hindou Sanatani. Ce n’est pas que je n’aie aucune connaissance des livres saints. Je ne suis pas grand clerc en sanscrit, je n’ai lu les Vedas et les Upanishads que dans les traductions, ma connaissance n’en est donc pas érudite, mais je les ai étudiés comme doit le faire tout Hindou et je prétends en avoir compris le véritable sens. J’avais également étudié avant d’avoir vingt-et-un ans les autres religions.
U||A certaine époque, j’hésitai entre l’Hindouisme et le Christianisme. Lorsque mon âme eut retrouvé son équilibre, j’eus le sentiment qu’il n’y avait pour moi de salut possible que dans la religion hindoue et ma foi dans l’Hindouisme devint plus profonde et plus éclairée.
U||Néanmoins, même à cette époque, je croyais que l’Intouchabilité ne faisait point partie de l’Hindouisme, et que si c’était le cas, cet Hindouisme-là, je n’en voulais point.
U||Il est vrai que l’Hindouisme ne traite pas l’intouchabilité de péché. Je ne désire pas faire de controverse sur l’interprétation des Shastras. Il me serait difficile de démontrer ma manière de voir en m’appuyant 217 sur le Bhagwat ou le Manusmriti. Mais je prétends avoir compris l’esprit de l’Hindouisme. L’Hindouisme a péché en sanctionnant l’intouchabilité qui nous a dégradés, qui a fait de nous les parias de l’Empire. Les Musulmans eux-mêmes, à notre contact ont pris la contagion; et dans l’Afrique du Sud, l’Afrique orientale et le Canada, les Musulmans aussi bien que les Hindous ont fini par être considérés comme des parias. Tout ce mal provient du péché d’Intouchabilité.
U||Je rappellerai ici la proposition que j’avais émise: tant que les Hindous s’obstineront à considérer l’Intouchabilité comme un dogme de leur religion, tant qu’ils considéreront que c’est un péché de toucher un groupe de leurs frères, le Swaraj est impossible. Yudhishthira refusa d’entrer au ciel sans son chien. Comment les descendants de Yudhishthira peuvent-ils donc espérer obtenir le Swaraj sans les intouchables? Les crimes que nous reprochons au Gouvernement actuel et pour lesquels nous l’avons qualifié de Satanique ne les avons-nous pas commis envers nos frères?
U||Nous sommes coupables d’avoir supprimé nos frères, de les avoir obligés à ramper sur le ventre, à se frotter la face contre terre; les yeux injectés de sang par la colère, nous les avons jetés hors des compartiments de chemins de fer. Qu’a fait de plus à notre égard le gouvernement anglais? Quelles accusations proférons-nous contre Dyer et O’Dwyer que notre peuple ne pourrait proférer contre nous? Nous devons nous débarrasser de cette souillure. Il est inutile de parler de Swaraj tant que nous ne protégeons pas les faibles et les êtres sans défense, 218 tant qu’il est possible à un Swarajiste de blesser les sentiments de quelqu’un. Le Swaraj signifie que nul Hindou, nul Musulman ne doit avoir l’arrogance de s’imaginer qu’il peut impunément écraser d’humbles Hindous ou Musulmans. Tant que cette condition ne sera pas remplie, nous n’obtiendrons le Swaraj que pour le perdre aussitôt. Tant que nous ne nous serons pas purgés des péchés que nous avons commis envers nos fr
U||ères plus faibles, nous ne valons guère mieux que des brutes.
U||Mais j’ai encore confiance. Pendant mes pérégrinations dans l’Inde, je me suis rendu compte que l’esprit de bonté dont parle si éloquemment Tulcidas, qui est la base des religions Jain et Vaishnava, qui est la quintessence de la Bhagavat et dont chaque verset de la Gita est imprégné, cette bonté, cet amour, cette charité s’implantent lentement dans le cœur des masses de ce pays.
U||On entend parler encore de maintes querelles entre Hindous et Musulmans. Il en est encore beaucoup qui n’ont aucun scrupule à se faire du tort les uns aux autres, mais j’ai l’impression qu’en définitive il existe plus de bonté et plus de charité. Les Hindous et les Musulmans craignent Dieu; nous nous sommes soustraits à l’hypnotisme des tribunaux et des écoles du gouvernement, et ne nous laissons plus influencer par d’autres hantises de ce genre. Je me suis rendu compte également que ceux que nous considérions comme des ignorants illettrés sont ceux-là même qui ont vraiment de l’éducation. Ils sont plus cultivés que nous, leur existence est plus pure. En étudiant quelque peu la mentalité actuelle du peuple on verra que selon la conception populaire le Swaraj 219 est synonyme de Ram-Raj—l’établissement du Royaume du Bien sur terre.
U||Si cela peut vous procurer quelque consolation, mes frères intouchables je vous dirai que la question qui vous concerne ne cause plus la même agitation qu’autrefois. Sans doute je ne m’attends pas à ce que vous n’ayez plus aucune méfiance à l’égard des Hindous. Comment ces derniers mériteraient-ils de ne plus exciter votre défiance, eux qui vous ont si mal traités? Swami Vivekananda déclarait que les intouchables n’étaient pas déprimés, qu’ils étaient «supprimés» par les Hindous, que ceux-ci s’étaient supprimés eux-mêmes en les supprimant.
U||J’étais à Nellore le 6 avril. J’y ai rencontré des intouchables et j’ai fait, ce jour-là, la même prière qu’aujourd’hui. Je désire obtenir Moksha. Je ne désire pas renaître; mais si je dois renaître je voudrais renaître parmi les intouchables afin de partager leurs peines, leurs souffrances, leurs affronts et pouvoir essayer de les tirer de leur misérable condition. Aussi, dans ma prière ai-je demandé, si je dois naître une seconde fois, de ne pas renaître Brahmane, Kshatriya, Vaishya ou Shudra mais Atishudra.
U||En ce jour beaucoup plus solennel que le 6, car il est sanctifié par le souvenir du massacre de milliers d’innocents, j’ai demandé également dans ma prière, si je devais mourir sans qu’aucun de mes désirs se soit réalisé, sans que j’aie achevé ma tâche au sujet des intouchables, sans avoir rempli comme il faut mon devoir et purifié l’Hindouisme, que je puisse renaître parmi les intouchables afin d’accomplir jusqu’au bout mon devoir et purifier l’Hindouisme.
U||J’ai la passion de nettoyer. Dans mon Ashram un 220 Brahmane de 18 ans fait le travail de boueur pour montrer la propreté à celui dont c’est l’office. Ce jeune homme n’est pas un réformateur. Il est né et a été élevé dans l’orthodoxie. Il lit régulièrement la Gita et fidèlement accomplit le Sandhyavandana. Sa prononciation des versets sanscrits est certainement plus impeccable que la mienne et lorsqu’il préside à la prière sa douce voix mélodieuse vous émeut et vous remplit d’amour. Mais il a jugé ses talents incomplets tant qu’il ne serait pas un balayeur accompli et il a pensé que s’il voulait que le balayeur de l’Ashram fît bien son travail, il devait lui-même lui donner l’exemple.
U||Vous devriez comprendre que vous nettoyez la société hindoue et que par conséquent il vous faut purifier votre propre existence. Il vous faut acquérir des habitudes de propreté afin que nul ne puisse vous montrer du doigt. Si vos moyens ne vous permettent pas d’acheter du savon pour vous nettoyer servez-vous de cendre d’alcali ou de terre. Quelques-uns d’entre vous êtes portés à boire et à jouer; il faut vous en corriger. Vous allez montrer du doigt les Brahmanes et dire qu’eux aussi s’adonnent à ces vices. Mais eux n’ont pas la réputation d’être impurs alors que vous, vous l’avez. Vous ne devez pas demander aux Hindous de vous faire une faveur en vous affranchissant. Il faut que les Hindous agissent ainsi seulement s’ils le désirent et dans leur propre intérêt. Votre pureté et votre propreté devront donc leur faire honte. Je crois que nous nous serons purifiés d’ici cinq mois. Si je suis déçu dans mon attente je penserai m’être trompé dans mes calculs, mais non da
U||ns la justesse fondamentale de ma proposition.
U||221
U||Vous vous dites des Hindous, vous lisez le Bhagavat; et par conséquent, si les Hindous vous oppriment, vous devez savoir que la faute ne provient pas de la religion hindoue, mais de ceux qui la professent. Afin de vous affranchir débarrassez-vous d’habitudes malsaines comme celle de la boisson.
U||Si vous désirez améliorer votre situation, si vous voulez obtenir le Swaraj, il faut savoir compter sur vous-mêmes. On m’a dit à Bombay que certains d’entre vous vous opposiez à la Non-Coopération et croyiez que le salut n’était possible pour vous que par l’action du Gouvernement Britannique. Permettez-moi de vous dire que ce ne sera jamais en rejetant la religion hindoue et en recherchant les faveurs d’un tiers que vous arriverez à une réforme. Votre affranchissement dépend de vous seuls.
U||Je me suis trouvé en rapport avec les intouchables dans le pays entier et j’ai remarqué en eux des possibilités latentes dont ni eux ni les autres Hindous ne se rendent compte. Leur intelligence est d’une pureté virginale. Je vous demande d’apprendre à filer et à tisser; si vous adoptez ceci comme profession vous chasserez la pauvreté de vos chaumières.
U||A présent, vous ne devriez plus accepter les reliefs que l’on vous offre, si propre que l’on vous dise que soit cette nourriture, n’acceptez que du grain, du grain qui ne soit pas moisi et seulement si on vous l’offre avec courtoisie. Si vous vous sentez capables de faire tout ce que je vous demande, vous obtiendrez votre affranchissement non pas dans quatre ou cinq mois d’ici mais dans quelques jours.
U||Les Hindous ne sont pas naturellement portés au mal, mais ils sont plongés dans l’ignorance. L’intouchabilité 222 doit disparaître cette année. Deux des plus ardents désirs qui m’aident à vivre sont l’affranchissement des intouchables et la protection de la vache. Lorsqu’ils auront été exaucés ce sera le Swaraj; et voilà en quoi consiste mon propre Moksha (émancipation). Que Dieu vous accorde la force de travailler à votre salut!

U||L’INTOUCHABILITÉ DISPARAIT
U||De toutes les expériences agréables de ma visite au Gujerat[84] aucune ne me fut plus agréable que la 223 manière sympathique dont les classes supprimées furent reçues par les autres Hindous. Partout mes auditeurs écoutèrent les remarques que je fis à ce sujet sans montrer aucun ressentiment. A Kalol, une réunion d’intouchables auxquels je devais m’adresser 224 eut lieu. Je demandais aux Mahagans de bien vouloir me permettre de leur parler au Pandal construit pour la réunion générale. Après quelque hésitation ceux-ci consentirent. Je devais aller chercher ces «hors castes» dans leur quartier et les amener. Ils habitaient trop loin pour y venir et je leur parlai près de l’hôpital. Je remarquai avec plaisir qu’un certain nombre des Hindous orthodoxes qui se trouvaient avec moi se mêlèrent aux femmes et aux hommes accourus en foule des quartiers des parias, qui m’entouraient. Mais ma satisfaction fut à son comble lorsqu’à Shisodra, grand village près de Navsari, tous les Dhed
U||s qui se tenaient nombreux à quelque distance d’un grand meeting auquel je devais parler furent admis en connaissance de cause. Cette admission solennelle et consentie de plusieurs centaines d’hommes et de femmes de la classe intouchable au milieu d’une importante réunion me paraît un signe évident du caractère religieux du mouvement. M. Vallavabhai Patel, afin d’en être doublement sûr demanda à ceux qui approuvaient de lever la main et l’on aperçut une forêt de mains. L’expérience fut répétée à Bardoli devant un auditoire aussi nombreux et obtint les mêmes résultats satisfaisants. L’Intouchabilité disparaît certainement et sa disparition rendra la voie qui mène au «Swaraj» plus facile et plus sûre.

U||L’UNION HINDOUE-MUSULMANE
U||«L’Union fait la force» n’est pas seulement une maxime de cahier d’écriture, c’est aussi une règle de vie et rien ne le démontre autant que l’Union Hindoue-Musulmane. La désunion, c’est notre chute inévitable. N’importe quelle troisième puissance pourra facilement nous réduire à l’esclavage tant que nous serons prêts à nous entr’égorger. L’Union Hindoue-Musulmane ne signifie pas seulement union des Hindous et des Musulmans mais de tous ceux qui considèrent l’Inde comme leur pays quelle que soit la religion à laquelle ils appartiennent.
U||Je sais très bien que nous ne sommes pas encore arrivés à une Union capable de supporter une tension. C’est une plante délicate et jeune qui croît chaque jour et demande des soins spéciaux. La chose était évidente à Nellore où je me trouvais en face du problème sous une forme concrète. Les relations entre Hindous et Musulmans n’étaient pas trop cordiales. Ils s’étaient battus moins de deux ans auparavant pour ce qui me parut une cause bien futile. Il s’agissait de cette éternelle question de musique en passant devant des mosquées. Je trouve que nous ne devons pas attribuer à toutes les petites choses une importance religieuse. Un Hindou ne devrait pas 226 s’obstiner à faire de la musique lorsqu’il passe devant une mosquée ni, pour s’en donner le droit, citer des précédents chez lui et ailleurs. Cette question n’a pas pour lui d’importance vitale.
U||Il est facile de comprendre les sentiments des musulmans qui désirent avoir pendant les 24 heures entières un silence absolu auprès de leur mosquée. Ce qui n’est pas essentiel pour un Hindou peut être essentiel pour un Mahométan, et sur tout ce qui n’est pas essentiel, un Hindou doit céder si on le lui demande. C’est une folie criminelle que de se disputer pour des vétilles. L’union à laquelle nous aspirons ne saurait être durable si nous ne développons en nous une disposition charitable et conciliante. La vache, pour les Hindous, est plus précieuse que l’existence même, aussi le Mahométan doit-il de bon cœur se conformer au désir de son frère hindou. Le silence autour de ses prières est cher au Musulman, dès lors tout Hindou doit respecter les sentiments de son frère musulman. Il y a de méchants Hindous comme il y a de méchants Musulmans portés à chercher querelle à tout propos. Pour ces derniers il faudra organiser des panchayats (tribunaux d’arbitrage populaires) d’u
U||ne intégrité et d’une fermeté incontestables et dont la sentence sera décisive pour les deux parties. Il serait bon d’amener l’opinion publique à approuver l’arbitrage des panchayats afin que nul ne puisse en contester la décision.
U||Je sais qu’il existe encore beaucoup trop de méfiance. Nombre d’Hindous doutent de la sincérité des Musulmans. Ils croient que le Swaraj veut dire: gouvernement des Musulmans, ils prétendent que les Anglais n’étant plus là les Musulmans de l’Inde 227 aideront les puissances musulmanes à établir dans l’Inde un empire musulman. D’autre part, les Musulmans craignent que les Hindous étant en majorité écrasante, ne les étouffent. Une telle tendance d’esprit est un signe de faiblesse chez les uns et chez les autres. Leur désir de vivre en paix, sinon leur noblesse de sentiments, devrait leur dicter une politique de confiance mutuelle et d’indulgence réciproque. Il n’existe absolument rien dans leurs religions respectives qui doive les diviser. L’époque des conversions forcées est passée. Les Hindous n’ont aucune raison de querelle avec les Musulmans sauf au sujet de la vache. Et les Musulmans n’ont aucune obligation religieuse de la tuer. A dire vrai nous n’avions jamais 
U||essayé jusqu’à ces derniers temps d’arranger ces différends et de vivre comme des amis qui sont unis parce qu’ils sont les enfants du même sol sacré. Une occasion unique s’offre à nous. La question du Califat ne se représentera pas avant un autre siècle. Si les Hindous veulent qu’une amitié éternelle les unisse aux Musulmans, il faut qu’ils soient prêts à mourir avec eux dans leurs efforts pour défendre l’honneur de l’Islam.

U||QUE LES HINDOUS PRENNENT GARDE
U||Bihar est la terre promise de la Non-Coopération; l’Union Hindoue Musulmane de Bihar est proverbiale. Je suis donc très malheureux d’apprendre qu’elle est soumise à une rude épreuve et ne pourra peut-être la supporter plus longtemps. Tous les chefs responsables, Hindous et Musulmans, qui ne sont pas portés à s’affoler, m’ont déclaré qu’il leur fallait un effort presque surhumain pour empêcher des troubles hindous-musulmans de se produire. Ils m’ont informé que certains Hindous avaient dit au peuple que j’avais défendu la viande à tous les Hindous et à tous les Musulmans; et parfois même la viande et le poisson étaient enlevés de force par des végétariens trop zélés. Je sais qu’on se sert souvent de mon nom illégalement, mais c’est bien la plus nouvelle façon de s’en servir mal à propos. On sait en général que je suis un végétarien convaincu et que je veux réformer l’alimentation. Mais on ne sait pas aussi généralement qu’Ahimsa s’étend aux êtres hu
U||mains comme aux animaux inférieurs et que je fréquente couramment ceux qui mangent de la viande.
U||Je ne tuerais pas un être humain pour protéger une vache, mais je ne tuerais pas une vache pour 229 protéger une existence humaine si précieuse qu’elle fût. Inutile de dire que je n’ai donné à personne l’autorisation de prêcher le végétarianisme comme faisant partie de la Non-Coopération. Je suis persuadé que nous n’atteindrons jamais notre but si une propagande quelconque s’accompagne de violence. Les Hindous ne doivent pas obliger les Musulmans à ne pas manger de viande ni même de bœuf. Les Hindous végétariens n’ont pas le droit de forcer les autres Hindous à s’abstenir de viande, de volaille et de poisson. Je n’essayerais pas de rendre l’Inde sobre à la pointe de l’épée. Rien ne porte atteinte au moral de la nation comme la violence. La peur est arrivée à faire partie du caractère national. Les Non-Coopérateurs feront une grande faute s’ils cherchent à convertir les gens par la violence; et s’ils emploient dans leur propagande la moindre coercition, ils fe
U||ront le jeu du Gouvernement[85].
U||La question de la vache est une question importante, la plus sérieuse qui soit pour les Hindous. Personne n’a plus que moi le respect de la vache. Les Hindous manquent à leur devoir s’ils ne sont pas capables de la protéger. Ils ont deux moyens de le faire: la force physique ou la force d’âme. Vouloir protéger la vache par la violence, c’est abaisser l’hindouisme et le rendre satanique, c’est avilir la noble signification de la protection de la vache. Ainsi que me l’écrivait un ami musulman, «Si les Hindous ont recours à la contrainte, manger du bœuf qui est seulement autorisé dans 230 l’Islam deviendra une obligation.» Les Hindous ne peuvent protéger la vache qu’en se montrant toujours plus capables de souffrir et de mourir. Le seul moyen qu’ils possèdent de sauver la vache du couteau du boucher c’est de s’efforcer de sauver l’Islam du péril qui le menace et de s’en rapporter à leurs compatriotes musulmans pour y répondre noblement, en protégeant de bon gré la v
U||ache par respect pour leurs compatriotes hindous. Il faut que les Hindous s’abstiennent scrupuleusement de toute violence à l’égard des Musulmans. Souffrir et avoir confiance sont les attributs de la force de l’âme. J’ai entendu dire qu’à des foires importantes, les Musulmans se voient enlever brutalement leurs vaches et même leurs chèvres. Ceux qui se vantent d’être des Hindous et qui ont ainsi recours à la violence sont les ennemis de la vache et de l’Hindouisme. Le meilleur, l’unique moyen de sauver la vache, c’est de sauver le Califat. J’espère par conséquent que chaque Non-Coopérateur fera tous ses efforts pour empêcher la moindre tendance à la violence, sous n’importe quelle forme, que ce soit pour protéger la vache ou un autre animal, ou pour tout autre but.

U||L’INQUIÉTUDE DU POÈTE
U||Le Poète de l’Asie, ainsi que Lord Hardinge appelait le Dr Tagore, devient rapidement s’il ne l’est déjà le poète du monde. Ce prestige croissant augmente sa responsabilité. Le plus grand service qu’il ait rendu à l’Inde est d’avoir interprété poétiquement le message de l’Inde au monde. Aussi le poète désire-t-il ardemment que l’Inde ne communique nul message faible ou inexact. Il est naturellement jaloux de la réputation de son pays. Il déclare s’être donné beaucoup de mal pour se mettre à l’unisson du mouvement actuel. Il avoue qu’il est dérouté. Il ne peut rien trouver pour sa lyre dans le tapage et le tumulte de la Non-Coopération. Il a essayé dans trois lettres vigoureuses d’exprimer ses doutes et aboutit à la conclusion que la méthode de Non-Coopération manque de dignité pour l’Inde qu’il se représente; que c’est une doctrine de négation et de désespoir. Il craint que ce ne soit une doctrine de désunion, d’exclusion, d’étroitesse et de nég
U||ation.
U||Aucun Indien ne peut manquer d’être fier de la délicatesse raffinée du Poète quand il s’agit de l’honneur de l’Inde. Il est bon qu’il nous ait exprimé ses craintes en une langue si belle et si claire.
U||Je vais essayer en toute simplicité de répondre à 232 ses doutes; je ne parviendrai peut-être pas à le convaincre et je ne convaincrai peut-être pas le lecteur que son éloquence aura touché; mais je tiens à lui assurer, ainsi qu’à l’Inde, que notre conception de Non-Coopération n’est nullement ce qu’il craint et qu’il n’a pas à rougir de son pays pour l’avoir adoptée. Si finalement elle échoue dans son application, la doctrine n’en sera pas plus responsable que ne l’est la vérité, lorsque ceux qui prétendent la mettre en pratique ne semblent pas y parvenir. La Non-Coopération est peut-être en avance sur son temps. En ce cas il faudra que l’Inde et le monde entier attendent. Mais l’Inde ne peut choisir qu’entre la violence et la Non-Coopération.
U||Le poète n’a pas non plus à craindre que la Non-Coopération veuille élever une muraille de Chine entre l’Inde et l’Occident. La Non-Coopération au contraire a pour but de préparer la voie à une coopération véritable, honorable et volontaire basée sur le respect et la confiance réciproques. La lutte est engagée contre une coopération obligatoire, contre une combinaison unilatérale, contre la contrainte par la force des armes d’accepter les méthodes modernes d’exploitation en les baptisant du faux nom de civilisation. La Non-Coopération est une forme de protestation contre une participation démoralisatrice et non consentie au mal.
U||Le poète s’inquiète surtout des étudiants. Il trouve regrettable qu’on les ait engagés à quitter les écoles du gouvernement, avant que d’autres écoles fussent là pour les remplacer. Je dois dire que sur ce point je ne suis pas de son avis. Je n’ai jamais pu faire un fétiche des études littéraires. L’expérience m’a démontré 233 que les études littéraires n’ajoutaient pas un pouce à notre stature morale et que la formation littéraire n’a aucun rapport avec la formation du caractère. Je suis tout à fait certain que les écoles du gouvernement nous ont dévirilisés, nous ont rendus impuissants et impies. Elles nous ont remplis de mécontentement, et, ne fournissant aucun remède, nous ont découragés. Elles ont réussi à faire de nous ce qu’elles voulaient: une nation d’employés et d’interprètes. Un gouvernement établit son prestige sur l’association apparemment consentie de ceux qu’il gouverne. Or s’il était mal de coopérer avec un gouvernement qui nous ma
U||intient dans l’esclavage, il était nécessaire de commencer par ces institutions où notre association semblait la plus volontaire. La jeunesse est l’espoir d’une nation. Dès l’instant où nous nous sommes rendus compte que le système de gouvernement était entièrement ou presque entièrement un mal, je considère que ce devenait un péché de notre part d’y associer nos enfants.
U||La valeur de mon argument n’est aucunement ébranlé parce que, le premier mouvement d’enthousiasme passé, la majorité des étudiants sont retournés à leurs écoles. Ce serait une preuve, non de l’erreur de la mesure, mais du degré d’avilissement auquel nous sommes arrivés. L’expérience a démontré que la création d’écoles nationales n’a pas attiré beaucoup plus d’étudiants. Les plus forts et les plus loyaux d’entre eux avaient boycotté leurs écoles sans avoir d’autres écoles pour les remplacer et je suis persuadé que ces premiers étudiants qui ont donné l’exemple nous rendent des services incomparables.
U||Mais l’opposition du Poète à faire sortir les jeunes 234 gens de leurs écoles est en réalité un corollaire de son objection à la doctrine même de Non-Coopération. Il a horreur de toute négation. Son âme entière semble se révolter contre les commandements négatifs de la religion. Il faut citer ses objections dans son style inimitable: «R. pour soutenir le mouvement actuel m’a souvent dit que la passion de rejeter est tout d’abord une force plus puissante que l’acceptation d’un idéal. Je ne puis, tout en sachant que c’est exact, l’admettre comme vérité... Brahmavidya, dans l’Inde a pour but Mukti (l’émancipation) alors que le Bouddhisme a Nirvana (l’extinction). Mukti attire notre attention vers le côté positif et Nirvana vers le côté négatif de la vérité. Aussi ce dernier a-t-il insisté sur la Duhkha (souffrance) qui doit être évitée; et le Brahmavidya a insisté sur Ananda (la joie) à laquelle il faut arriver». Dans ce passage et dans d’autres du même gen
U||re le lecteur trouvera l’explication de la mentalité du Poète. A mon humble avis rejeter est aussi bien un idéal qu’accepter. Il est aussi nécessaire de rejeter ce qui n’est pas vérité que d’accepter la vérité. Toutes les religions nous enseignent que deux forces agissent sur nous et que les efforts de l’homme consistent à accepter et à rejeter éternellement. Ne pas coopérer avec ce qui est mal est autant un devoir que coopérer avec ce qui est bien. Je me permets de suggérer que le Poète a commis envers le Bouddhisme une injustice involontaire en décrivant le Nirvana comme un état négatif; j’ose avancer que Mukti (l’émancipation) est tout aussi négatif que Nirvana. S’émanciper de l’esclavage de la chair ou le supprimer conduit à Ananda (bonheur éternel). Permettez-moi de terminer cette 235 partie de ma discussion en attirant votre attention sur le mot final des Upanishads (Brahmavidya) qui est Neti (pas ceci). Neti fut la meilleure définition que les auteurs des Upan
U||ishads purent trouver pour Brahmane.
U||Je crois donc que le Poète s’est alarmé inutilement, à l’aspect de la Non-Coopération. Nous avons perdu la faculté de dire non. Dire non au gouvernement était devenu déloyal et presque sacrilège. Ce refus délibéré de coopérer est semblable au procédé du cultivateur qui doit arracher les mauvaises herbes. Sarcler est aussi important que planter, dans l’agriculture. Même quand le grain pousse, la sarclette est un instrument d’usage journalier ainsi que tout cultivateur le sait. La Non-Coopération de la nation invite le gouvernement à coopérer avec elle dans certaines conditions établies par elle ainsi que toute nation en a le droit et tout gouvernement le devoir. La Non-Coopération est la méthode employée par la nation pour prévenir le gouvernement qu’elle n’est plus satisfaite d’être en tutelle. La nation a accepté la doctrine naturelle, religieuse et inoffensive (pour elle), de la Non-Coopération au lieu de la doctrine irréligieuse de la violence. Si l’Inde atteint 
U||jamais le Swaraj dont rêve le Poète, elle n’y parviendra que par la Non-Coopération non violente. Qu’il communique au monde son message de paix et qu’il soit persuadé que l’Inde, si elle demeure fidèle à son vœu, démontrera ce message par sa Non-Coopération. Le but de la Non-Coopération est de donner au patriotisme le sens même que le Poète souhaite si ardemment. Une Inde prostrée aux pieds de l’Europe ne saurait donner aucune espérance à l’humanité. Une Inde vivante et libre a 236 pour un monde gémissant un message de paix et de bonne volonté. La Non-Coopération lui fournira la tribune d’où elle pourra le prêcher.

U||CULTURE ANGLAISE
U||Le lecteur trouvera ailleurs mon humble tentative pour répondre à la critique de Docteur Tagore sur la Non-Coopération. J’ai lu depuis la lettre qu’il a adressée au directeur de Shantiniketan. Je regrette qu’il l’ait écrite sous l’empire de la colère et dans l’ignorance des faits. Le poète s’est indigné naturellement en apprenant que certains étudiants de Londres avaient manifesté à une des conférences de M. Pearson, un des Anglais les plus sincères, et l’avaient empêché de parler. Il s’est indigné également en apprenant que j’avais demandé à nos femmes de cesser leurs études anglaises. Evidemment le Poète a tiré de lui-même les raisons qui avaient motivé ce conseil.
U||Comme il eût mieux fait de ne pas attribuer la discourtoisie des étudiants à la Non-Coopération, et de se souvenir que les Non-Coopérateurs ont un culte pour M. Andrews, vénèrent Stokes, et à Nagpur écoutèrent avec le plus profond respect MM. Wedgwood, Ben 237 Spoor, et Holford Knight; que Maulana Mahomed Ali accepta de prendre le thé avec un haut fonctionnaire anglais lorsque ce dernier l’en pria comme ami, que Hakim Ajmalkhan, non-coopérateur convaincu, ayant fait placer dans son Collège les portraits de Lord et de Lady Hardinge, invita, lorsqu’on les découvrit, ses nombreux amis Anglais à la cérémonie! Comme il eût mieux fait d’empêcher le démon du doute de s’emparer de lui pendant quelques instants, pour lui cacher le caractère religieux véritable du mouvement actuel, et de croire que ce mouvement transforme le sens des vieilles expressions nationalisme et patriotisme en les élargissant!
U||S’il s’était rendu compte, avec son imagination de poète que j’étais incapable de vouloir rétrécir l’esprit des femmes indiennes et que je ne pouvais par conséquent m’opposer à la culture anglaise; s’il s’était souvenu que toute ma vie j’ai été le champion de la liberté entière de la femme, il se fût épargné de me faire pareille injustice, injustice qu’il ne ferait point consciemment, je le sais, à un ennemi déclaré. Le poète ignore peut-être qu’on apprend l’anglais aujourd’hui pour sa valeur commerciale et sa soi-disant valeur politique. Nos jeunes gens croient, et vu les circonstances actuelles avec juste raison, que les fonctions du gouvernement leur sont fermées s’ils ne savent pas l’anglais. On l’enseigne aux jeunes filles comme passe-port pour le mariage. Je connais plusieurs femmes qui veulent apprendre l’anglais afin de pouvoir parler aux Anglais dans leur langue. Je connais des maris qui sont contrariés que leur femme ne puisse converser en angla
U||is avec eux ou avec leurs amis. Je connais des familles où l’anglais est imposé 238 comme langue maternelle. Des centaines de jeunes gens s’imaginent que sans la connaissance de l’anglais la liberté de l’Inde est à peu près impossible. Le chancre a tellement rongé la société qu’en maintes circonstances, savoir l’anglais est devenu synonyme d’avoir de l’éducation. Pour moi, tout ceci démontre notre esclavage et notre avilissement. Il m’est insupportable de penser que nos langues indigènes ont été écrasées et étouffées à ce point. Je ne puis tolérer l’idée que des parents écrivent à leurs enfants, et des enfants à leurs parents dans une autre langue que leur langue maternelle.
U||Je crois aimer le grand air autant que le poète, je ne veux pas que ma maison soit entourée de murs ni mes fenêtres condamnées. Je veux que le vent des cultures de tous les pays y souffle librement mais je me refuse à ce qu’aucune me fasse perdre l’équilibre. Je me refuse à vivre chez les autres en intrus, en mendiant ou en esclave. Je ne veux pas imposer à mes sœurs la fatigue inutile d’apprendre l’anglais par faux orgueil ou pour un avantage social douteux. Je désire que les jeunes gens et les jeunes filles qui ont des aptitudes pour la littérature apprennent l’anglais et toutes les langues qu’il leur plaira et qu’ensuite ils fassent profiter l’Inde et le monde entier de leurs connaissances ainsi que l’ont fait un Bose, un Roy et le Poète lui-même. Mais je m’oppose absolument à ce qu’un seul individu oublie, néglige ou rougisse de sa langue maternelle et s’imagine qu’il ne peut exprimer dans celle-ci ses meilleures pensées. Ma religion n’est pas une religion de p
U||rison, elle admet dans son sein les plus infimes créatures de Dieu; seulement elle est fermée à l’insolence, à l’orgueil de 239 race, de religion ou de couleur. Je suis extrêmement peiné que le poète se méprenne sur le sens de ce grand mouvement de réformation, de purification et de patriotisme réunis sous le nom d’humanité. S’il veut se montrer patient, il verra qu’il n’aura aucune raison de chagrin ou de honte pour ses compatriotes. Je l’avertis respectueusement de ne pas confondre le mouvement avec ses excroissances. Il est aussi faux de juger la Non-Coopération d’après la conduite grossière des étudiants de Londres ou de Malegaon dans l’Inde que de juger les Anglais d’après les Dyer et les O’Dwyer.

U||AU PARTI MODÉRÉ
U||Chers amis,
U||J’éprouve un véritable chagrin à être séparé de vous par les idées, alors que par mon éducation et par mes associations j’ai été élevé au milieu de ceux que l’on considérait comme Modérés. Les circonstances et mon tempérament ont fait que je n’ai jamais appartenu à aucun des grands partis de l’Inde. Ma vie, néanmoins, a subi beaucoup plus l’influence d’hommes appartenant au parti Modéré que 240 celle du parti Extrémiste: Dadabhai Naoroji, Gokhale, Badruddin Tyabji, Pherozeshah Mehta sont des noms que l’on peut évoquer. Les services qu’ils ont rendus au pays ne pourront jamais s’oublier. Ils ont inspiré un grand nombre d’esprits dans le pays tout entier comme ils m’ont inspiré moi-même. J’ai eu avec plusieurs d’entre vous les rapports les plus agréables. Quelle raison m’a donc arraché à votre groupe pour me jeter dans les bras du parti nationaliste? Comment se fait-il que j’aie plus de choses en commun avec eux? Je ne vois pas que votre affection pou
U||r votre pays soit moins grande que la leur. Je me refuse à croire que vous soyez moins disposés à vous sacrifier pour le bien du pays que les Nationalistes. Le parti Modéré peut assurément se dire aussi intelligent, aussi sincère, aussi compétent sinon plus que le parti Nationaliste. La différence provient donc de leurs différents idéaux.
U||Je ne vais pas vous fatiguer à les discuter. Je vais pour l’instant attirer tout simplement votre attention sur certains points du programme constructif du mouvement de Non-Coopération. Il se peut que le mot ne vous plaise pas. Je sais qu’un grand nombre des points du programme vous déplairont extrêmement; mais si vous admettez que les Non-coopérateurs ont pour leur pays un amour égal au vôtre, n’envisagerez-vous point d’un œil favorable cette partie du programme où il est impossible d’avoir deux opinions? Je pense au fléau de l’alcoolisme. Je vous prie de me croire, si je vous déclare que le pays en général en est révolté. Les malheureux qui sont devenus les esclaves de la boisson ont besoin qu’on les aide à se défendre contre eux-mêmes. Quelques-uns 241 le demandent. Je vous supplie de profiter de la vague de sentiment qui s’est élevée contre le commerce de la boisson. L’agitation a pris naissance spontanément. Croyez-moi, ce qui a le moins d’importance, c’est ce 
U||que le pays peut perdre financièrement. Lui-même est impatient de se débarrasser de ce fléau. Aucun pays ne pourra continuer ce commerce devant l’opposition générale et éclairée d’un peuple, comme c’est le cas actuellement dans l’Inde. Quels que soient les excès commis à Nagpur par la foule, la cause était juste. Le peuple était décidé à se délivrer du fléau de l’alcoolisme qui sapait sa vitalité. Vous ne vous laisserez pas influencer par l’argument spécieux qu’il ne faut pas rendre l’Inde sobre par la contrainte et que ceux qui veulent boire doivent en avoir la facilité. Le rôle de l’Etat n’est pas de pourvoir aux vices du peuple. Nous n’autorisons ni ne réglementons des maisons mal-famées, nous n’accordons pas certaines facilités au voleur pour qu’il puisse satisfaire son penchant. Je considère que la boisson est plus condamnable que le vol et peut-être même que la prostitution; d’ailleurs n’est-ce pas souvent la cause de l’un et l’autre? Je vous
U|| demande donc de joindre vos efforts à ceux du pays pour supprimer totalement les revenus que l’Etat tire de la boisson et pour abolir les débits. Un grand nombre de débitants accepteraient volontiers de fermer boutique si on leur remboursait ce qu’ils ont payé.
U||Que dire de l’éducation des enfants? Je me permets de suggérer qu’il est très humiliant pour un pays que ses enfants doivent leur éducation aux revenus tirés de la boisson. Nous mériterons d’être maudits par la postérité si nous ne décidons pas 242 sagement de faire cesser le fléau de l’alcoolisme, dussions-nous pour cela sacrifier l’éducation de nos enfants. Mais ce n’est nullement nécessaire. Je sais que beaucoup d’entre vous se sont moqués de l’idée de rendre l’éducation indépendante financièrement en faisant filer et tisser dans nos écoles et dans nos collèges. Je vous assure que là se trouve la meilleure solution du problème. Le pays ne peut supporter une augmentation d’impôts; ceux qui existent sont déjà trop lourds. Non seulement il nous faut supprimer le revenu provenant de l’opium et de la boisson, mais encore diminuer considérablement les autres si nous voulons combattre le plus rapidement possible la pauvreté croissante des masses.
U||Ceci m’amène à parler du système actuel de gouvernement. Le pays n’a rien gagné aux Réformes, au contraire. Les dépenses annuelles se sont accrues. Une étude plus sérieuse du système m’a convaincu que tous les à-peu-près tentés pour y remédier n’aboutiront à rien de bon. Une révolution complète, voilà ce qu’il nous faut. Le mot révolution vous déplaît. Ce que je demande n’est pas une révolution sanglante, mais une révolution dans le domaine de la pensée qui amènerait une révision radicale de la façon de vivre dans les services supérieurs du pays. Je dois vous avouer franchement que les appointements de plus en plus élevés qui sont payés aux fonctionnaires dans ces divers services m’effrayent positivement, comme ils vous effraieraient vous-mêmes, je l’espère. Y a-t-il quelque rapport entre l’existence que mènent les gouverneurs et les milliers d’administrés qui gémissent sous leur talon? Les corps meurtris de ces derniers sont le témoignage vivant 243 de
U|| ce que j’avance. Vous appartenez maintenant à la classe dirigeante. Qu’on ne dise pas que votre talon est aussi dur que celui de vos prédécesseurs ou de vos collaborateurs. Est-il nécessaire que vous gouverniez de Simla? Est-il nécessaire que vous adoptiez la politique à laquelle vous vous opposiez il y a un an? C’est sous votre régime qu’un homme a été condamné à la déportation perpétuelle à cause de ses opinions. Vous ne pouvez dire pour vous défendre qu’il incitait à la violence car il y a peu de temps vous avez refusé de l’admettre. Les frères Ali se sont excusés de la moindre violence exprimée dans leurs discours. Vous commettez envers le pays une cruelle injustice si vous vous laissez persuader que c’est par crainte des poursuites qu’ils ont fait ces excuses. Un esprit nouveau est né dans le pays. Nous craignons plus le juge qui est en nous-mêmes que celui qui est au dehors.
U||Ignorez-vous que depuis six mois des jeunes gens à l’âme noble et élevée, vos compatriotes, ont choisi de rester en prison plutôt que de payer un cautionnement qu’ils considéraient comme une honte? C’est sous votre régime que la patience des Moplahs absolument innocents a été mise à une rude épreuve, et jusqu’à présent cette patience ne leur a pas fait défaut. Je serais heureux de croire, comme je le fais vraiment, que vous n’êtes pas responsables des atrocités qui sont perpétrées en ce moment au nom de la paix et de la justice. Mais vous ne voudriez pas que moi ou le public, nous disions que là où vous n’avez pas les yeux bandés vous êtes impuissants! Ceci m’amènerait cependant à parler de nos différents idéaux et je ne dois pas aborder ce sujet à présent. Si le 244 pays peut seulement obtenir que vous l’aidiez à faire cesser le commerce de la boisson, vous ajouterez certainement aux nombreux services que vous avez déjà rendus dans le passé; peut être ce prem
U||ier pas vous montrera-t-il bien d’autres possibilités.

U||LA QUESTION TURQUE
U|| 
U|| 
U|| 
U||L’Angleterre doit choisir, il lui est impossible de considérer plus longtemps comme esclaves les Hindous et les Musulmans dont les yeux se sont ouverts. Si l’Inde doit demeurer l’associée de chacune des autres parties de l’Empire et être leur égale, il faut que sa puissance électorale soit de beaucoup supérieure à celle de chacune des autres. Dans toute confédération indépendante, chaque associé possède le droit de se retirer si les autres agissent mal, de même qu’il a le devoir d’y adhérer aussi longtemps que les autres restent fidèles à certains principes communs. Si l’Inde votait mal, l’Angleterre aurait la ressource de se retirer de la Société, ainsi que tout associé en a le droit. Le centre de l’équilibre doit donc se déplacer 245 et passer aux Indes, au lieu de rester en Angleterre. Voilà ce que j’entends par le Swaraj au sein de l’Empire. La force brutale doit être exclue de toute délibération, il faut en toute circonstance s’en rapporter à la raison e
U||t non à l’épée.
U||Il en est de l’Inde comme de l’Angleterre. L’Inde doit choisir également. Nous luttons aujourd’hui pour le Swaraj au sein de l’Empire, dans l’espoir que l’Angleterre finira par se montrer juste envers l’Inde, et pour notre indépendance si elle s’y refuse. Et quand il sera absolument démontré que l’Angleterre cherche à anéantir la Turquie, nous n’aurons pas d’autre choix que l’indépendance. Quand l’existence de la Turquie, telle qu’elle est, se trouvera menacée, les Musulmans n’hésiteront pas. S’ils le pouvaient, ils tireraient l’épée et périraient avec les braves Turcs ou vaincraient avec eux; mais si, grâce à la politique du Gouvernement indien il leur est interdit de déclarer la guerre à l’Angleterre, il leur reste la possibilité de refuser l’obéissance à un gouvernement qui fait criminellement la guerre aux Turcs. Le devoir des Hindous est tout aussi évident. Si nous craignons toujours les Musulmans, si nous manquons de confiance en eux il faut n
U||ous mettre du côté des Anglais et prolonger notre esclavage. Si nous sommes assez braves et assez religieux pour ne pas craindre les Musulmans, nos compatriotes, si nous avons la sagesse de nous fier à eux, nous devons faire cause commune et employer toutes les mesures pacifiques et loyales qui pourront assurer à l’Inde son indépendance. Un Hindou, selon ma conception de l’Hindouïsme, que ce soit pour obtenir l’indépendance de l’Inde ou le Swaraj au sein de l’Empire n’a qu’une méthode, celle de la 246 Non-Coopération non violente. L’Inde peut dès aujourd’hui obtenir le rang de «Dominion» ou l’indépendance si elle apprend le secret de la puissance invincible de la non-violence et se l’assimile. Lorsque l’Inde aura appris cette leçon, elle sera capable d’appliquer tous les degrés de la Non-Coopération, y compris le refus de payer les impôts. L’Inde n’en est pas encore capable mais si nous voulons être à même de déjouer toutes les conspirations ourdies pour dé
U||truire la Turquie et prolonger notre esclavage, il faut créer autour de nous une atmosphère de non-violence éclairée, non pas la non-violence des faibles, mais celle des forts qui tout en dédaignant de tuer sont prêts à donner joyeusement leur vie pour la défense de la Vérité.
U||29 juin 1921.
U||LE COMITÉ D’ACTION ET SON ROLE
U||Les résolutions votées par le Comité d’Action ont provoqué certaines critiques hostiles... Il devient donc nécessaire d’examiner le rôle du Comité d’Action, mais afin de pouvoir le comprendre il faut connaître la Constitution du Congrès.
U||Le but du Congrès est d’obtenir le Swaraj par des méthodes pacifiques et légitimes. Le Congrès doit 247 fonctionner de façon à hâter la marche de l’Inde vers ce but. La Constitution est faite pour mettre à l’épreuve la nation et voir si elle est capable de se gouverner elle-même. Elle crée certainement un système de gouvernement volontaire où la seule force est l’opinion publique et le bon-vouloir du peuple. Et comme le Congrès cherche à s’opposer au gouvernement actuel et à le détruire s’il le faut, il s’ensuit que plus le Congrès aura d’autorité, moins il en restera au gouvernement. Lorsque le Congrès possèdera la confiance générale et qu’une obéissance spontanée répondra à ses instructions le «Swaraj» complet sera atteint. Car le gouvernement se verra obligé de respecter l’opinion populaire dont le Congrès sera le porte-parole, ou sinon, de se suicider. Il faut donc que le Congrès devienne l’organisation la plus vaste, la plus unie et la plus solide qu
U||i existe sur ce sol. Il faut que sa politique rencontre une acceptation immédiate.
U||Le Congrès ne se réunit qu’une fois par an, il établit son programme. Le Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde, doit mettre en œuvre la politique du Congrès dans le sens exprimé par ses décisions. Il doit interpréter ces décisions et s’occuper de toutes les questions nouvelles avec la même autorité que le Congrès. Les membres du Comité peuvent discuter les différentes propositions et leur interprétation autant qu’il leur plaît, mais sauf pour des questions vitales de principes les dissidents doivent se conformer aux résolutions votées par la majorité et les exécuter fidèlement. Les projets qui donnent lieu à des discussions au Comité, ne peuvent être discutés une seconde fois en public. Afin de permettre au Comité du Congrès 248 de toute l’Inde d’avoir une valeur pratique, la Constitution a établi un Comité d’Action de quinze membres qui doit se réunir fréquemment et traiter toutes les questions que lui renvoie le Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde. Il doit, lors
U||que ce dernier ne siège pas, en exercer toutes les fonctions. Il doit se tenir au courant de l’opinion publique, la guider et lui servir d’interprète; il doit s’assurer que toutes les organisations secondaires fonctionnent convenablement, s’occuper des finances de l’Inde entière et les distribuer, et lorsqu’une résolution sur quelque sujet grave doit être prise, convoquer une assemblée du Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde afin que celui-ci décide. Le Comité d’action est au Congrès ce qu’un cabinet ministériel est au parlement. Il faut que ses décisions soient respectées si nous voulons établir un gouvernement constitutionnel dans le courant de l’année.
U||Il faut, bien entendu, qu’il soit composé de personnes qui inspirent à la nation et au Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde le plus grand respect. Il faut que ce soit un corps homogène et qu’il ne prenne pas de décisions trop précipitées. Il ne peut y avoir dans son sein deux politiques ou deux partis. Alors que le Congrès représente la nation toute entière, le Comité d’Action doit réunir les représentants de la politique du parti qui a la confiance de la majorité des délégués. Il faut avant tout que ses décisions soient unanimes. Lorsqu’un membre du Comité d’action se sent dans l’impossibilité de suivre les autres, il peut donner sa démission mais il ne doit en aucune façon gêner ou influencer les délibérations du Comité en les discutant ouvertement dans la presse. Par conséquent, 249 et bien que les décisions prises par le Comité d’Action soient définitivement adoptées par les membres du Congrès, ce n’est pas un corps irresponsable. Le Comité du Congrès de 
U||toute l’Inde peut le dissoudre par un vote de manque de confiance. Les décisions peuvent être revues par le Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde et même rejetées s’il y a de sérieuses raisons pour cela. A mon humble avis il est indispensable que le Comité d’Action en impose au peuple sans quoi nous n’arriverons pas au Swaraj cette année. Chacun de nous doit donc faire en sorte de rendre le Congrès irrésistible en exécutant ses décisions dans les moindres détails. Ce que le Gouvernement obtient en dernier ressort par la force des armes, il faut que nous l’obtenions par la force de l’affection. Le gouvernement s’est fait irrésistible par la terreur; le Congrès doit le devenir en obtenant la soumission volontaire à ses doctrines et à ses vues politiques. La non-violence pénètre ainsi dans tout ce qui se rapporte au programme du peuple; mais chaque organisation s’attend à réussir grâce à la coopération du peuple. Se montrer soumis aux décisions du Congrès c’est le sine
U|| qua non du succès de la résolution prise à Nagpur d’obtenir le Swaraj cette année.

U||COMMENT BOYCOTTER LES TISSUS ÉTRANGERS
U||Il est inutile qu’à cette heure tardive nous répétions que le boycottage de tissus étrangers, auquel nous songeons, n’est aucunement une mesure vindicative. Mais elle est aussi nécessaire à l’existence de la nation que l’air est nécessaire à la vie. Plus elle s’accomplira rapidement, mieux cela vaudra pour le pays. Sans elle, le Swaraj ne saurait être établi ni maintenu une fois institué. Il est de la plus haute importance de savoir comment organiser ce boycottage avant le 1er août prochain. Pour qu’il ait lieu rapidement, il faut: 1o que tous les propriétaires des filatures réglementent leurs bénéfices et qu’ils fabriquent surtout pour le marché indien;—2o que les importateurs cessent d’acheter des marchandises étrangères (trois négociants de marque ont déjà commencé);—3o que les acheteurs refusent les tissus étrangers et se procurent du tissu Khadi lorsque c’est possible;—4o que les acheteurs ne portent que des vêtements de tissus Khadi et que le tissu des f
U||ilatures soit conservé pour les pauvres qui ne connaissent pas la différence entre le Swadeshi et le Pardeshi;—5o que les consommateurs n’emploient jusqu’à l’établissement du Swaraj et la production suffisante du 251 Khadi que ce dont ils ont besoin pour se couvrir le corps;—6o que les consommateurs détruisent tout tissu Pardeshi comme ils le feraient de boissons alcoolisées, s’ils s’étaient engagés à l’abstinence, ou sinon qu’ils le vendent pour qu’il soit employé à l’étranger, ou qu’ils l’utilisent eux-mêmes pour les besognes malpropres ou lorsqu’ils sont seuls.
U||Nous espérons que tous ceux auxquels s’adressent les clauses précédentes y répondront d’une façon satisfaisante et simultanée. Mais le succès dépend avant tout de la persévérance du consommateur. Il suffit qu’il se refuse à porter l’insigne de son esclavage.

U||A TOUT ANGLAIS HABITANT L’INDE
U||Cher Ami,
U||C’est la seconde fois que je me permets de m’adresser à vous. Je sais que la plupart d’entre vous avez la Non-Coopération en horreur. Je désirerais cependant, si vous voulez bien croire à ma sincérité, vous prier de mettre à part deux des questions dont je m’occupe.
U||Si vous ne sentez pas ma sincérité, je ne puis vous la prouver. Quelques-uns de mes amis indiens m’accusent 252 de déguiser la vérité lorsque je prétends que, tout en abhorrant le système établi par les Anglais, nous ne sommes pas tenus de les haïr. J’essaie de montrer que l’on peut détester les vices d’un frère sans le haïr lui-même. Jésus dénonça les vices des scribes et des pharisiens, mais il n’avait pour eux aucune haine. Cette loi d’amour pour l’homme et de haine pour le mal qui est en lui, Jésus ne l’énonça pas pour lui seul; il l’enseigna comme doctrine. Je l’ai d’ailleurs trouvée dans toutes les religions du monde entier.
U||Je crois être assez bon juge de la nature humaine, et vivisecteur de mes propres faiblesses. J’ai découvert que l’homme est supérieur au système qu’il organise. J’ai donc l’impression qu’individuellement vous valez beaucoup mieux que le système que votre communauté a établi. Chacun de mes compatriotes qui se trouvait à Amritsar en ce fatal 10 avril valait mieux individuellement que la foule dont il faisait partie. Seul, aucun d’eux n’eût accepté de tuer les innocents directeurs de banque anglaise, mais dans la foule plus d’un perdit la tête. C’est pour cette raison que l’Anglais qui remplit une fonction publique dans l’Inde est différent de l’Anglais qui habite l’Angleterre. Ici, vous faites partie d’un système d’une indicible infamie. Je puis donc condamner ce système dans les termes les plus violents, sans pour cela vous considérer comme mauvais, ni imputer de mauvaises intentions à tous les Anglais. Vous êtes autant que nous les esclaves de votre système. 
U||Je désire donc que vous agissiez de même envers moi et ne m’accusiez point d’intentions que vous n’avez point vues écrites de ma main. Je vous aurai déclaré le mobile 253 entier de mes actions quand je vous aurai dit que j’ai hâte d’améliorer ou de faire cesser un système obligeant l’Inde à obéir à une poignée d’entre vous et ne donnant aux Anglais le sentiment de la sécurité qu’à l’abri de forts et de canons qui s’imposent à la vue. Ce spectacle est une honte, et pour vous et pour nous. Notre existence commune est basée sur la méfiance et sur la crainte réciproque. Vous admettrez certainement que cela manque de dignité. Un système responsable d’un pareil état de choses est forcément satanique. Il devrait vous être possible de vivre dans l’Inde comme faisant partie intégrale de son peuple et non comme des exploiteurs étrangers. Mille existences indiennes pour une existence anglaise est une doctrine qui conduit au désespoir, et pourtant vous pouvez me croire,
U|| en 1919, elle fut énoncée par les plus puissants d’entre vous.
U||Je serais presque tenté de vous proposer de vous joindre à moi pour détruire un système qui nous a fait descendre si bas vous et nous. Mais je sens qu’il est trop tôt. Nous n’avons pas encore donné suffisamment de preuves de notre sincérité, de notre abnégation et de notre empire sur nous-mêmes pour pouvoir le faire.
U||Mais ce que je vous demande c’est de nous aider à boycotter le tissu étranger et à combattre le fléau de la boisson.
U||Les tissus du Lancashire furent imposés à l’Inde ainsi que l’ont démontré les historiens anglais, et les manufactures indiennes célèbres dans le monde entier, furent ruinées délibérément et systématiquement. Non seulement l’Inde en est réduite à être à la merci du Lancashire, mais aussi du Japon, de 254 la France et de l’Amérique. Rendez-vous compte de ce que cela signifie pour l’Inde. Chaque année, nous envoyons hors de l’Inde environ 60 millions de roupies pour acheter du tissu, alors que nous produisons assez de coton pour fabriquer tout le tissu dont nous avons besoin. N’est-ce pas de la folie d’exporter notre coton pour qu’il nous revienne manufacturé sous forme de tissu? Etait-il juste de réduire l’Inde à une telle condition? Il y a 150 ans, nous fabriquions tout le tissu que nous portions. Nos femmes filaient de beau fil dans leurs chaumières et ajoutaient au gain de leur mari; les tisserands des villages le tissaient. Pour un immense pays agricole comme le nô
U||tre, cet apport jouait un rôle important dans l’économie nationale. Il nous permettait d’employer nos instants de loisir de la façon la plus naturelle. Aujourd’hui, les femmes ont perdu l’adresse de leurs mains et l’oisiveté forcée de milliers d’individus a appauvri le pays. Un grand nombre de tisserands se sont mis balayeurs, d’autres se sont engagés comme mercenaires. La moitié de la race des artistes tisseurs a disparu et les autres tissent du fil importé, faute de pouvoir en tisser qui ait été filé à la main.
U||Vous comprendrez peut-être à présent ce que le boycottage du tissu étranger signifie pour l’Inde. Cette mesure n’est pas un châtiment. Si dès aujourd’hui le gouvernement réparait les injustices faites au Califat et au Pendjab et consentait immédiatement à donner le Swaraj à l’Inde, celle-ci devrait quand même continuer le boycottage des tissus étrangers. Swaraj signifie au moins le droit de conserver les industries de l’Inde qui sont indispensables à l’existence économique de la nation, et d’interdire 255 toute exportation capable de mettre obstacle à cette existence. L’agriculture et le rouet sont comme les deux poumons de l’Inde, il faut à tout prix qu’on les préserve de la consomption.
U||Cette question ne peut attendre. Il est impossible de considérer les intérêts des fabricants étrangers et des importateurs indiens lorsque la nation entière meurt de faim, faute d’avoir une occupation rémunératrice qui s’ajoute à l’agriculture.
U||Ne considérez pas à tort ce mouvement comme un boycottage général des produits étrangers. L’Inde ne cherche nullement à se fermer le commerce international. A l’exception des tissus, il lui faut accepter avec reconnaissance et dans des conditions avantageuses pour les parties contractantes les marchandises qui sont mieux fabriquées hors de son pays. Mais rien ne doit lui être imposé. Je ne cherche pas à lire dans l’avenir, mais j’espère certainement qu’avant peu il sera possible à l’Inde de coopérer avec l’Angleterre sur un pied d’égalité. Le moment sera venu alors d’examiner les relations commerciales. Pour l’instant, je vous demande de nous aider à organiser le boycottage des tissus étrangers.
U||La campagne contre l’alcoolisme est d’une importance analogue et tout aussi grande. Les débits sont un fléau intolérable imposé à la société. Jamais le peuple ne s’est autant intéressé à la question. J’admets qu’ici les ministres des Indes peuvent faire plus que vous. Je voudrais néanmoins que vous exprimiez clairement votre opinion sur ce point. Si je ne me trompe, sous n’importe quel gouvernement, la Nation demandera une complète prohibition. Il vous est possible de développer l’agitation croissante à ce sujet 256 en mettant le poids de votre influence dans le plateau de la balance.

U||PROFESSION DE FOI
U||J’ai reçu une lettre anonyme bien étrange. Elle m’admire d’avoir embrassé une des causes les plus chères à Lockamanya[86] et me dit que son esprit vit en moi, et que je dois demeurer le digne disciple de ce maître. Elle m’adjure d’autre part de ne pas me laisser décourager dans la poursuite du programme Swaraj, et termine en m’accusant d’imposture, parce que je prétends être en politique un disciple de Gokhale. Je voudrais bien que ceux qui m’écrivent perdent cette vile habitude de ne pas signer leurs lettres. Il faut que nous qui voulons acquérir l’esprit du Swaraj développions en nous le courage d’exprimer sans crainte ce que nous pensons. Le sujet de la lettre ayant une importance générale demande néanmoins qu’on y réponde. Je ne puis prétendre à l’honneur d’être le disciple de Lockamanya. Je l’admire, ainsi que des milliers de ses compatriotes pour son courage 257 indomptable, ses vastes connaissances, son amour pour son pays et par dessus tout pour la puret
U||é de sa vie privée et son grand renoncement. Il fut, parmi tous les hommes de notre époque, celui qui captivait le plus l’imagination de son peuple. C’est lui qui nous a inspiré l’esprit du Swaraj. Personne peut-être ne se rendit compte comme M. Tilak du caractère pernicieux de notre système actuel de gouvernement. Et j’ose prétendre, en toute humilité, que je communique au pays son message aussi exactement que le meilleur d’entre ses disciples. Mais je me rends compte que mes méthodes ne sont pas celles de M. Tilak. Et c’est pourquoi il m’arrive encore d’avoir certaines difficultés avec quelques-uns des chefs Maharashtra. Mais je suis sincèrement convaincu que M. Tilak ne se refusait pas à croire à ma méthode. Il m’honorait de sa confiance, et les dernières paroles qu’il m’adressa devant plusieurs amis, quinze jours avant sa mort, furent pour me dire que ma méthode était excellente, à condition de pouvoir persuader au peuple de l’adopter. Mais il en doutait. Je ne 
U||connais pas d’autre méthode, et puis seulement espérer que lorsque viendra le moment de l’épreuve définitive, le pays montrera qu’il s’est assimilé la méthode de Non-Coopération non-violente. Je n’ignore pas non plus ce qui me manque; je ne prétends point à l’érudition; je ne possède pas son talent d’organisateur; je ne dirige pas de parti solide et discipliné, et je ne puis, ayant vécu trente trois ans hors de l’Inde, prétendre à la même expérience que Lockamanya. Nous avions deux choses absolument en commun: notre amour pour notre pays et nos efforts infatigables pour obtenir le Swaraj. Je puis donc assurer 258 à mon compatriote anonyme que personne n’a plus que moi le respect de la mémoire du défunt et que je marcherai au Swaraj côte à côte avec ses plus fidèles disciples. Je sais que le Swaraj de l’Inde est la seule offrande qui lui soit agréable. Cela seul peut donner la paix à son âme.
U||C’est néanmoins une question personnelle et sacrée que d’être un disciple. En 1888, je me suis jeté aux pieds de Dadabhai, mais il semblait trop éloigné de moi. Je pouvais avoir pour lui les sentiments d’un fils, mais non pas d’un disciple. Un disciple est plus qu’un fils. Devenir un disciple c’est naître une seconde fois; c’est se livrer volontairement......
U||En 1896, ma mission dans le Sud-Afrique me mit en rapport avec tous les chefs connus... J’allai voir Gokhale, je le rencontrai dans le logement qu’il occupait à son collège; on eût dit que je retrouvais un vieil ami, ou mieux encore, une mère après une longue séparation. Son doux visage me mit à l’aise sur-le-champ. Ses questions minutieuses sur moi et sur ce que j’avais fait dans l’Afrique du Sud lui gagnèrent une place unique dans mon cœur. En le quittant je me dis: «Voilà l’homme qu’il me faut.» De ce jour, Gokhale ne me perdit jamais de vue. En 1901, lorsque je revins d’Afrique pour la seconde fois, nous devînmes encore plus unis. Il se chargea de moi, tout simplement, et se mit à me former. Il s’intéressait à ma façon de parler, de m’habiller, de marcher, de manger. Ma mère n’avait pas plus de sollicitude pour moi que n’en avait Gokhale. Autant que j’en puis juger, nulle contrainte n’existait entre nous. C’était vraiment un coup de foudre qui résista à 
U||la sévère tension de 1913. Comme travailleur politique, il répondait 259 à tout ce que je pouvais souhaiter: pur comme le cristal, doux comme un agneau, brave comme un lion et chevaleresque à l’excès. Peu importait qu’il ne fût peut-être pas tout ce que j’imaginais. Il me suffisait de ne rien trouver à critiquer. Il était et demeure pour moi l’homme le plus parfait qui ait existé. Non que nous n’ayons eu certaines divergences d’opinion. Même en 1901, nous avions déjà des points de vue différents sur certaines coutumes sociales, nous ne jugions pas de la même façon la civilisation occidentale. Il admettait franchement qu’il ne partageait pas mon opinion extrémiste sur la Non-violence. Mais ces divergences ne nous importaient ni à l’un ni à l’autre, rien n’eût pu nous désunir. Il est impie de vouloir faire des suppositions sur ce qui aurait eu lieu s’il eût vécu. Je sais que j’aurais continué à travailler sous sa direction. J’ai fait cette confession parce qu
U||e la lettre anonyme m’a fait mal en m’accusant d’imposture lorsque je me déclare le disciple de Gokhale. Aurais-je trop tardé à reconnaître ce que je dois à celui qui s’est tu pour jamais? J’ai cru devoir déclarer que je lui reste fidèle, surtout puisque je parais aux yeux du monde indien, vivre dans un camp opposé au sien.

U||LA POSITION DES FEMMES
U||Shrimati Sarala Devi de Katak m’écrit: «Ne trouvez-vous pas que la façon de traiter les femmes est un mal aussi sérieux que l’Intouchabilité? L’attitude des jeunes gens «Nationalistes» que j’ai rencontrés est quatre vingt dix-neuf fois sur cent absolument écœurante. Combien en est-il parmi les Non-Coopérateurs qui considèrent la femme comme autre chose qu’un objet de plaisir? La condition essentielle du succès, la purification de soi-même est-elle possible tant que l’attitude envers les femmes n’aura pas changé?» Je ne puis admettre que la manière de traiter les femmes soit «un mal aussi sérieux que l’Intouchabilité». Shrimat Sarel Devi s’en est beaucoup exagéré la gravité, et l’accusation qu’elle porte contre les Non-Coopérateurs, de ne chercher que la satisfaction des sens, n’est point soutenable. L’exagération peut faire grand tort à une cause. Je reconnais néanmoins sans difficulté que, pour se préparer au Swaraj, les hommes doivent acquérir un res
U||pect plus grand de la femme et de sa pureté. M. Andrews a frappé bien plus juste lorsqu’il nous dit en termes brûlants de ne point oser nous repaître de la honte de nos sœurs tombées. Il est dégradant de penser qu’un Non-Coopérateur a pu prendre plaisir à raconter comment certaines de ces sœurs égarées se réservaient 261 aux Non-Coopérateurs. Dans une question aussi vitale pour notre bien moral, nulle distinction entre Coopérateur et Non-Coopérateur ne peut se faire. Tous, comme hommes, nous devons baisser la tête de honte tant qu’il restera une seule femme consacrée à nos plaisirs. Je préférerais beaucoup que la race humaine disparût plutôt que de nous voir devenir pires que des animaux en faisant de la plus noble créature de Dieu l’objet de notre concupiscence. Mais cette question ne concerne pas l’Inde uniquement, elle concerne le monde entier. Et si je prêche contre cette vie moderne artificielle de plaisirs sensuels et demande aux hommes et aux femmes de revenir à la 
U||vie simple représentée par la Charka (rouet), c’est parce que je sais que sans ce retour intelligent à la simplicité nous tomberons forcément plus bas que la brute. Je souhaite passionnément pour la femme une liberté absolue. J’exècre les mariages d’enfants, je frémis lorsque je vois une fillette veuve, et je tremble de fureur lorsqu’un homme qui vient de perdre sa femme contracte une autre union avec une indifférence brutale. Je déplore l’indifférence criminelle des parents qui tiennent leurs filles dans l’ignorance, ne leur donnent aucune culture littéraire et les élèvent uniquement en vue d’un mariage avec quelque jeune homme riche. Pourtant malgré ma fureur et mon chagrin, je me rends compte de la difficulté du problème. Il faut que la femme vote, que sa position devant la loi soit égale à celle de l’homme. Mais le problème ne s’arrête pas là, il ne commence qu’au moment où les femmes ont quelque influence sur les délibérations politiques de la Nation.
U||262
U||Pour illustrer ce que je veux dire, permettez-moi de vous rapporter la description charmante faite par un ami musulman que j’estime, de sa conversation à Londres avec une célèbre féministe. Il assistait à une réunion de féministes. Une dame amie fut surprise de voir un musulman à une réunion de ce genre. Elle lui demanda à quoi elle devait attribuer sa présence. Mon ami lui répondit qu’il avait deux raisons principales et deux autres secondaires pour y assister. Il avait perdu son père, étant enfant en bas âge; ce qu’il était, il le devait entièrement à sa mère. Puis il s’était marié à une femme qui était vraiment son associée. Enfin, il n’avait pas de fils, mais quatre filles mineures auxquelles il s’intéressait comme père. Etait-ce surprenant qu’il fût féministe? Il poursuivit: on accuse les Musulmans d’indifférence envers les femmes. Il n’y eut jamais de calomnie plus grave. La loi de l’Islam donne à la femme des droits égaux à ceux de l’homme.—Il co
U||nsidérait que l’homme avait avili la femme par sa convoitise. Au lieu d’adorer l’âme qui se trouvait en elle, il s’était mis à adorer son corps et il avait si bien réussi dans son dessein que la femme aujourd’hui, sans s’en rendre compte, s’était mise à chérir ses avantages physiques, ce qui était presque un signe de sa servitude. Il ajouta d’une voix qu’étouffait l’émotion: Autrement, pourquoi nos sœurs tombées trouveraient-elles un si grand plaisir à l’embellissement de leur corps? Est-ce que nous autres hommes, n’avons pas complètement anéanti leur âme? Non, continua-t-il après avoir repris son sang-froid, il ne désirait pas une liberté machinale pour la femme; il voulait briser les entraves qui la rendaient esclave de sa propre volonté. 263 Aussi avait-il l’intention de préparer ses filles à une profession indépendante.
U||Je n’ai pas besoin de citer la fin de cette ennoblissante conversation. Je désire que mes aimables correspondantes réfléchissent au sujet principal. Il faut que la femme cesse de se considérer comme un objet de plaisir. Le remède est entre ses mains bien plus qu’entre celles de l’homme. Si elle veut que celui-ci la traite en associée, qu’elle refuse de se parer pour plaire aux hommes, même à son mari. Je ne puis me représenter Sita gaspillant un seul moment à vouloir attirer Rama par ses charmes physiques.

U||L’ÉDUCATION NATIONALE
U||On a dit tant de choses bizarres sur ma façon d’entendre l’éducation nationale qu’il ne serait peut-être pas hors de propos de faire connaître mon opinion au public sur ce sujet.
U||A mon avis la méthode d’éducation actuelle est mauvaise, pour trois raisons de la plus haute importance en dehors de ses rapports avec un gouvernement injuste:
U||1o Elle repose sur une culture étrangère à l’exclusion presque totale de la culture indigène.
U||264
U||2o Elle ignore la culture du cœur et la culture manuelle et se consacre exclusivement à celle du cerveau.
U||3o Il est impossible de donner une véritable éducation en se servant d’une langue étrangère.
U||Examinons ces trois défauts en détail. Presque dès le début, les manuels d’enseignement traitent, non de choses avec lesquelles les enfants sont journellement en rapport, mais de choses qui leur sont totalement inconnues. Ce n’est pas dans ces manuels qu’un jeune garçon apprendra ce qui est bien ou mal à la maison. On ne lui enseigne jamais à être fier de son foyer. Plus son éducation avance, plus on l’en éloigne, si bien que lorsqu’il a terminé ses études il est devenu complètement étranger à son milieu. Il ne trouve aucune poésie à la vie de famille. Les scènes villageoises sont pour lui un livre fermé. Sa propre civilisation lui a été représentée comme stupide, barbare, superstitieuse et inutile au point de vue pratique. Son éducation est calculée pour l’éloigner de la culture traditionnelle. Et si la masse de la jeunesse instruite n’est pas absolument dénationalisée, c’est uniquement parce que l’ancienne culture est trop profondément implantée en elle pour 
U||qu’il soit possible de la déraciner même par une éducation hostile à son développement. Si j’étais le maître, je détruirais certainement tous les manuels et j’en ferais écrire d’autres qui traiteraient de la vie de famille et qui s’y rapporteraient de sorte que l’enfant, en faisant ses études, influerait sur son entourage.
U||Secondement, et quelles que soient les conditions 265 dans les autres pays, il est criminel, dans l’Inde où 80 p. % de la population est agricole, de donner aux enfants une éducation purement littéraire et de rendre les garçons et les filles impropres aux travaux manuels pour le reste de leur vie. Je prétends que la majeure partie de notre temps étant consacrée à travailler pour gagner notre pain, nos enfants doivent, dès leur jeune âge, apprendre la dignité de ce labeur. Nos enfants devraient recevoir une éducation qui ne leur fît pas mépriser le travail manuel. Il n’y a aucune raison pour que le fils d’un paysan devienne incapable d’être ouvrier agricole parce qu’il a fait des études. Il est fort triste de voir nos écoliers considérer avec dégoût, quand ce n’est pas avec mépris, le travail manuel. D’autre part si nous voulons que dans l’Inde, tout jeune garçon et toute jeune fille fréquente les écoles, ainsi qu’il est de notre devoir, nous n’avons pas les moyens 
U||de subvenir à l’éducation telle qu’elle est donnée à présent, les milliers de parents étant dans l’impossibilité d’en payer les frais actuels. Il faut donc, pour que l’éducation devienne générale, qu’elle soit gratuite. Même sous un gouvernement idéal, je n’imagine pas que nous pourrons consacrer plus de 2000 millions de roupies à l’éducation de tous les enfants qui ont l’âge de fréquenter l’école. D’où il résulte qu’il faut que nos enfants payent par leur travail manuel tout ou partie de l’éducation qu’ils reçoivent. Je ne vois qu’un travail universel qui soit profitable, le rouet et le métier à tisser. Peu importe d’ailleurs, pour le but que je me propose, qu’il s’agisse de filer ou de faire une autre forme de travail, pourvu qu’il rapporte, seulement en y réfléchissant on se rendra compte que nulle 266 autre occupation ne peut être introduite dans toutes les écoles de l’Inde.
U||Cet enseignement manuel servira à deux fins dans un pays pauvre comme le nôtre. Il couvrira les dépenses de l’éducation de nos enfants et leur enseignera un métier auquel ils pourront se remettre plus tard, s’ils le désirent, pour gagner leur vie. Un tel système leur enseignera à se suffire. Rien ne peut démoraliser une nation comme d’apprendre à mépriser le travail manuel.
U||Je ne dirai qu’un mot de l’éducation du cœur. Je crois qu’il est impossible de la donner par les livres. Seul le maître par ses rapports personnels peut agir. Or, qui avons-nous dans l’enseignement primaire et même dans l’enseignement secondaire? Sont-ce des hommes et des femmes d’une foi et d’un caractère moral supérieurs? Ont-ils reçu eux-mêmes cette éducation du cœur? Peut-on attendre d’eux qu’ils s’occupent de l’élément permanent chez les enfants, garçons et filles dont ils ont la charge? La méthode employée pour se procurer des instituteurs dans les classes élémentaires n’est-elle pas une barrière infranchissable à l’obtention d’une haute moralité? Donne-t-on aux instituteurs des appointements qui leur permettent de vivre? Nous savons qu’on ne les choisit pas pour leur patriotisme. Ceux-là seuls font de l’enseignement qui ne peuvent trouver d’autre emploi.
U||Parlons enfin de la langue dans laquelle l’instruction est donnée. Mon opinion à ce sujet est trop connue pour que je la répète. L’enseignement dans une langue étrangère a été cause de fatigue cérébrale pour les enfants, a exigé d’eux une tension nerveuse 267 trop grande et, les rendant incapables de pensée, de travail original, les a empêchés de communiquer leurs connaissances à la famille ou aux masses.
U|| 
U||Rien n’est plus éloigné de ma pensée que de vouloir nous rendre exclusifs ou nous faire élever des barrières. Mais je soutiens respectueusement qu’une appréciation d’autres cultures doit suivre et non précéder l’appréciation et l’assimilation de la nôtre. J’ai la ferme opinion que nulle culture ne renferme des trésors aussi précieux. Nous ne la connaissons pas, on nous en fait mépriser l’étude et déprécier la valeur. Nous avons presque cessé de la vivre. Un savoir académique sans pratique est comme un cadavre embaumé, très beau à contempler peut-être, mais sans rien qui puisse inspirer ou ennoblir. Ma religion me défend d’abaisser ou de dédaigner les autres cultures, de même qu’elle insiste pour que je m’imprègne de la mienne et que je la vive sous peine de suicide civil.

U||ETHIQUE DE LA DESTRUCTION
U||Le lecteur sera, j’en suis persuadé, heureux de prendre connaissance de la lettre si belle et si pathétique que je reçois de M. Andrews.
U||268
U||«Je sais qu’en brûlant les tissus étrangers votre but est de venir en aide aux pauvres, mais j’ai l’impression que vous faites fausse route. Si vous réussissez à boycotter le tissu étranger il me semble évident que le prix du tissu fabriqué dans les filatures augmentera, et que ce seront les pauvres qui en souffriront. De plus, il y a dans ce terme «étranger» un subtil appel au sentiment de race qu’il faudrait plutôt réprimer qu’encourager. J’ai été profondément bouleversé de vous voir mettre le feu à ce monceau d’objets, parmi lesquels se trouvaient les plus beaux tissus. Nous avons l’air d’oublier ce vaste monde dont nous faisons partie pour ne songer égoïstement qu’à l’Inde. Je crains bien que ceci ne nous ramène au nationalisme étroit et égoïste d’autrefois. Dans ce cas, nous allons faire partie du cercle vicieux d’où l’Europe s’efforce désespérément d’échapper. Mais je ne puis le démontrer, je ne puis que répéter que j’en fus bouleversé
U||, que cela me semblait une forme de violence. Et cependant je sais à quel point vous exécrez la violence. Il me déplaît que la question du tissu étranger soit transformée en religion.
U||J’étais au comble du bonheur lorsque je vous voyais asséner des coups de géant aux vices qui affectent les fondements de la morale: l’alcoolisme, les stupéfiants, l’intouchabilité, l’arrogance de race, etc., et lorsqu’avec une si merveilleuse et si admirable tendresse vous vous êtes occupé de ce mal hideux qu’est la prostitution. Mais allumer des feux de joie avec des étoffes étrangères et dire aux gens que s’en vêtir est un péché contre la religion, jeter au bûcher le noble travail de nos semblables, nos frères et nos sœurs des autres pays, en déclarant que 269 c’est nous souiller que de les porter... Je ne saurais vous dire combien tout ceci me paraît différent! Savez-vous que j’ose à peine à présent porter le khaddar que vous m’avez donné, parce que j’ai peur de paraître juger les autres et de dire comme le pharisien: «Je suis un plus grand saint que vous». Jamais je n’avais eu semblable impression auparavant.
U||Vous savez que lorsque vous faites quelque chose qui me peine, il faut que je vous crie ma douleur; et ceci m’a fait mal.
U||J’avais écrit dans la Modern Review les articles que je vous envoie avec une grande joie, parce que j’avais la certitude d’avoir découvert le sens de votre vie. Mais à présent mon esprit vous crie que vous avez entrepris quelque chose de violent, d’anormal, de contre nature. Vous savez que mon affection pour vous demeure aussi grande que jamais, de même que la vôtre ne s’est pas affaiblie lorsque vous jugiez que votre frère se trompait. Je vous en supplie, expliquez-moi vos raisons! Votre article sur la destruction dans la Jeune Inde[87] ne m’a nullement convaincu.»
U||270
U||C’est bien lui! Dès qu’il souffre de quelque chose que j’ai fait (et ce n’est pas la première fois), il m’envoie lettre sur lettre sans attendre que je lui réponde. Car c’est l’affection qui parle à l’affection, 271 mais sans discuter. C’est le trop plein d’un cœur angoissé. Ainsi fait-il au sujet de la destruction des vêtements étrangers.
U||Ce que M. Andrews m’écrit en langage affectueux, d’autres correspondants, qui sont déjà en désaccord avec moi, me l’ont exprimé avec grossièreté, colère et même vulgarité. Les paroles de M. Andrews sont des paroles d’affection et de chagrin, elles m’ont pénétré profondément et demandent que j’y réponde, alors que j’ai dû laisser de côté les paroles de colère pour n’y faire allusion qu’en passant. Les paroles de M. Andrews ont porté, parce qu’elles sont non violentes et qu’elles débordent d’affection, les autres qui sont violentes et pleines de méchanceté n’ont produit aucun effet sur moi et eussent provoqué de ma part des répliques courroucées si j’étais enclin à ce genre de réponses. La lettre de M. Andrews est un exemple de la non-violence dont nous avons besoin pour obtenir le Swaraj le plus rapidement possible.
U||Ceci toutefois est une remarque faite en passant. Je demeure aussi convaincu de la nécessité de brûler le tissu étranger. Il n’y a rien dans ce procédé qui doive accentuer l’inimitié de race. J’aurais fait exactement de même s’il se fût agi d’un cercle choisi et sacré de parents et d’amis. Dans tout ce que j’entreprends, dans tout ce que je conseille, je me pose cette question infaillible: «Que ferais-je, s’il s’agissait de ce qui m’est le plus proche et le plus cher?» L’enseignement de la religion à laquelle j’appartiens ne laisse aucune équivoque à ce sujet. Il ne faut faire aucune différence entre les ennemis et les amis. C’est à cette conviction que je dois l’assurance 272 dans beaucoup de mes actions qui étonne parfois mes amis. Je me souviens d’avoir jeté dans la mer une superbe lorgnette parce qu’elle était la cause de discussions constantes avec un de mes meilleurs amis. Il a hésité tout d’abord à reconnaître que j’avais raison, mais ensuite
U|| il s’est rendu compte qu’il était juste d’avoir détruit un objet de prix, même étant le cadeau d’un ami.
U||L’expérience nous démontre qu’il faut détruire les dons les plus précieux sans hésitation et sans dédommagement, s’ils entravent notre progrès moral. Ne serait-ce point un devoir sacré de jeter au feu le plus précieux des héritages de famille s’il était infecté par la lèpre? Je me souviens d’avoir brisé les bracelets de ma chère femme, étant jeune et aimé, parce qu’ils étaient entre nous un sujet de discorde. Si je m’en souviens, ils lui avaient été donnés par sa mère. Je ne les détruisis point par haine mais par amour ignorant, je m’en rends compte à présent que j’ai atteint l’âge mûr. Cette destruction servit à nous rapprocher encore.
U||Si l’on attachait à tous les objets étrangers la même importance, la mesure serait en effet étroite, mesquine et malfaisante; mais il ne s’agit que du tissu étranger et la restriction fait toute la différence. Je ne désire en aucune façon interdire l’entrée dans l’Inde des montres anglaises ou des laques japonaises; mais je dois détruire les vins les plus recherchés de l’Europe, même s’ils ont été fabriqués et conservés avec le plus grand soin. Les pièges de Satan sont disposés avec une grande ruse, et d’autant plus attrayants que la ligne de démarcation entre le bien et le mal est si mince qu’elle est invisible. Mais elle 273 existe cependant, rigide, inflexible: toute tentative pour la traverser amène une mort certaine.
U||Le sentiment de race est très fort dans l’Inde aujourd’hui. C’est avec la plus grande difficulté que je parviens à contenir les mauvaises passions du peuple. La masse est remplie de rancune, parce qu’elle est faible et extrêmement ignorante de la façon de se débarrasser de cette faiblesse. Je transfère sur les choses la rancune des gens.
U||L’amour du tissu étranger a été cause de la domination étrangère, de la misère, et, ce qui est pire, de la honte dans mainte famille. Le lecteur ignore peut-être que des centaines de tisserands «intouchables» de Kathiawad ayant perdu leur métier, il y a peu de temps, se firent boueurs de la municipalité de Bombay. Et l’existence de ces hommes est si pénible qu’un grand nombre perdent leurs enfants et deviennent des épaves physiques et morales, d’autres deviennent les impuissants témoins de la déchéance de leurs filles et de leurs femmes. Le lecteur ignore peut-être que bien des femmes de cette classe dans le Gujerat, faute d’occupation domestique, se sont mises à travailler sur les routes où, sous la contrainte, elles sont obligées de vendre leur honneur. Le lecteur ignore peut-être que les fiers tisserands du Pendjab, il y a quelques années, faute d’occupation s’enrôlèrent, et obéissant aux ordres de leurs officiers furent responsables de la mort de fiers Arabes innoce
U||nts, et ceci non pas dans l’intérêt de leur pays, mais simplement pour ne pas mourir de faim. Il est difficile de persuader ces mercenaires abusés et de les soustraire à leur profession criminelle. Ce que l’on considérait autrefois comme un 274 métier artistique et honorable, ils le considèrent à présent comme un métier honteux. Et pourtant les tisserands du Dekkan ne devaient pas avoir une si mauvaise réputation lorsqu’ils tissèrent leur subnum célèbre dans le monde entier. Faut-il s’étonner à présent si je considère comme un crime de toucher au tissu étranger? Ne serait-il pas criminel pour un homme de digestion délicate de se nourrir de mets trop lourds? Ne doit-il pas les détruire ou les donner? Je sais comment je m’y prendrais pour en faire passer l’envie à un fils malade, je me les ferais apporter; et bien que moi je puisse les digérer, je les détruirais devant lui, afin de bien lui démontrer la faute qu’il eût commise en les mangeant.
U||Si la destruction du tissu étranger est une saine résolution au point de vue moral le plus élevé, la possibilité d’une augmentation de prix du tissu Swadeshi ne doit pas nous effrayer. Détruire est la meilleure façon de stimuler la production. Il faut par un effort suprême et par une destruction rapide réveiller l’Inde de sa torpeur et de sa paresse forcée. Voici ce qu’en 1905 le rédacteur de la Gazette d’Assam écrivait sur Kamrup. «Depuis quelques années, les vêtements importés deviennent à la mode—innovation qui n’a pas grand chose en sa faveur car le temps que l’on consacrait autrefois au métier n’est employé à aucune autre occupation.»
U||Les Assamais auxquels j’ai parlé reconnaissent à leurs dépens la vérité de ces paroles. Le tissu étranger est pour l’Inde ce que sont dans le corps les matières étrangères; il faut le détruire sans demi-mesure une fois reconnue la nécessité immédiate du Swadeshi. Nous n’avons pas à craindre non plus qu’en 275 développant l’esprit du Swadeshi nous développions un esprit étroit et exclusif. Avant de protéger la sainteté d’autrui il faut nous protéger nous-mêmes des effets de nos passions. L’Inde n’est aujourd’hui qu’une masse inerte que fait agir la volonté d’un tiers. Qu’elle devienne vivante en se purifiant, c’est-à-dire par l’abnégation et par la maîtrise de soi, et elle deviendra une bénédiction pour elle-même et pour l’humanité...
U||Pour qui croit au Swadeshi il ne saurait y avoir de satisfaction pharisienne à porter du khadi. Un pharisien est un protecteur de la vertu. Celui qui porte du khadi est, du point de vue du Swadeshi, comme un homme qui respire avec ses poumons. C’est un acte naturel et obligatoire qu’il faut accomplir, même si les autres l’accomplissent pour des raisons mauvaises ou s’en abstiennent totalement parce qu’ils n’en voient pas la nécessité ou l’utilité.

U||NOS SŒURS TOMBÉES
U||C’est à Cocanada dans la province d’Andhra que j’eus pour la première fois l’occasion de rencontrer ces femmes qui gagnent leur vie en se prostituant. L’entrevue ne dura que quelques instants, et elles 276 n’étaient guère plus d’une demi-douzaine. La seconde fois je les rencontrai à Barisal où plus de cent s’étaient réunies pour me voir. Elles m’avaient écrit auparavant, me demandant de leur accorder une entrevue et m’informant qu’elles étaient devenues membres du Congrès et avaient souscrit au Fonds Swaraj, mais qu’elles ne comprenaient pas pourquoi je leur conseillais de ne pas chercher à faire partie des divers comités du Congrès. Elles terminaient en me disant qu’elles désiraient me consulter, au sujet de leur avenir. Celui qui me remit leur lettre le fit avec quelque hésitation, ne sachant s’il me serait agréable ou désagréable de la recevoir. Je le mis à son aise, en lui affirmant que je considérais comme un devoir d’aider mes sœurs tombées si j’en
U|| avais le moyen.
U||Le souvenir des deux heures que je passai avec elles m’est précieux. Elles m’apprirent qu’elles étaient environ 350 au milieu d’une population de 20.000 personnes, hommes, femmes et enfants. Elles sont l’opprobre des hommes de Barisal; et plus tôt Barisal pourra y remédier, mieux cela vaudra pour sa réputation. Ce qui existe à Barisal existe également, je le crains, dans toutes les autres grandes villes. Je cite par conséquent Barisal uniquement pour me faire mieux comprendre. L’honneur d’avoir songé à servir ces sœurs tombées revient à quelques jeunes gens de cette ville. J’espère qu’à Barisal reviendra également l’honneur d’avoir supprimé le mal.
U||De tous les maux dont l’homme s’est rendu responsable il n’en est point de plus abject, de plus honteux et de plus brutal que sa façon d’abuser de ce que je 277 considère comme la meilleure moitié de l’humanité: le sexe féminin, non le sexe faible. C’est à mon avis le plus noble des deux, car même aujourd’hui il incarne le sacrifice, la douleur silencieuse, l’humilité, la foi et la connaissance. L’intuition de la femme est souvent plus juste que l’arrogante présomption de l’homme s’attribuant un savoir supérieur. Ce n’est pas sans raison que Sita est placée au-dessus de Rama et Radha au-dessus de Krishna. Ne nous abusons pas en croyant que ce jeu vicieux fasse partie de notre évolution, parce qu’il prédomine, et que parfois même il est reconnu et réglementé par l’Etat dans l’Europe civilisée. Ne perpétuons pas le vice en citant des précédents comme excuse. Dès l’instant où nous copierions servilement le passé que nous ne connaissons pas entièrement, e
U||t cesserions de distinguer entre la vertu et le vice, nous cesserions d’exister. Nous sommes les héritiers de tout ce qu’il y eut de plus noble et de meilleur dans l’antiquité. Nous ne devons pas déshonorer notre héritage, en multipliant les erreurs du passé. Dans une Inde qui se respecte, la vertu de toute femme ne doit-elle pas importer à tout homme autant que celle de sa propre sœur? Le Swaraj signifie que nous sommes capables de considérer tous les habitants de l’Inde comme nos frères et nos sœurs.
U||Aussi, en tant qu’homme, je baissai la tête de honte devant cette centaine de sœurs. Quelques-unes étaient âgées, la plupart avaient de vingt à trente ans, et deux ou trois n’étaient que des fillettes d’une douzaine d’années à peine. Elles me dirent qu’à elles toutes elles avaient six filles et quatre garçons. Les filles étaient élevées pour la même 278 vie, à moins qu’autre chose ne se présentât pour elles. La pensée que ces femmes considéraient leur sort comme irréparable vous donnait un coup de poignard au cœur. Et cependant, elles étaient intelligentes et modestes. Elles parlaient avec dignité, leurs réponses étaient franches et saines; pour l’instant, elles étaient aussi résolues que tout Satyagrahi. Onze d’entre elles promirent de se mettre à filer et à tisser dès le lendemain, si on les y aidait. Les autres me dirent qu’elles allaient réfléchir, parce qu’elles ne voulaient pas me tromper.
U||Voilà une tâche pour les citoyens de Barisal. Voilà une tâche pour tous les serviteurs de l’Inde, hommes et femmes. S’il y a 350 sœurs malheureuses pour une population de 20.000 habitants il y en existe peut-être 5.250.000 dans l’Inde. J’ose espérer pourtant que les 4/5 de la population de l’Inde qui vit dans les villages et s’occupe uniquement d’agriculture ignore ce vice. Le chiffre le plus bas serait donc dans l’Inde de 1.050.000 femmes obligées de se prostituer pour vivre. Avant qu’il nous soit possible de détourner ces femmes de leur avilissement, deux conditions sont essentielles. Il faut que les hommes apprennent à dominer leurs passions, et que l’on trouve pour ces femmes une occupation leur permettant de gagner leur vie honorablement. Le mouvement de Non-Coopération n’a aucun sens, s’il ne nous purifie et ne nous aide à réprimer nos mauvaises passions. Le rouet et le métier sont les deux seules occupations qu’elles puissent toutes entreprendre sans encombrer l
U||e marché. La plupart n’ont pas songé au mariage. Elles furent d’accord là-dessus. Il faut donc qu’elles deviennent les véritables 279 Sannyasinis (vestales) de l’Inde. N’ayant d’autre souci que de servir, elles pourront filer tant qu’elles voudront. Si un million cinq cent mille femmes sont occupées chaque jour à filer avec diligence pendant huit heures, ce sera pour l’Inde appauvrie un nombre égal de roupies. Ces sœurs m’ont dit qu’elles gagnaient au moins deux roupies par jour, seulement elles ont admis qu’il leur fallait pour éveiller la passion de l’homme beaucoup de choses, dont elles n’auraient plus besoin lorsqu’elles se seraient mises à tisser et qu’elles auraient repris une existence normale. Lorsque j’eus fini de leur parler individuellement, elles savaient, sans que j’aie eu besoin de le leur dire, pourquoi elles ne pouvaient faire partie des Comités du Congrès tant qu’elles n’auraient pas abandonné leur vie de péché. Nul ne peut officier à l
U||autel du Swaraj, s’il n’a les mains nettes et le cœur pur.

U||L’HINDOUISME
U||Pendant mon voyage à Madras, alors que je m’occupais du problème de l’Intouchabilité, j’ai revendiqué plus énergiquement que jamais le titre d’Hindou Sanatani, et cependant il y a certaines choses qui 280 se font au nom de l’Hindouïsme dont je ne tiens pas compte...
U||Il est donc nécessaire qu’une fois pour toutes j’explique ce que j’entends par l’Hindouïsme Sanatana dans le sens qu’on lui donne habituellement.
U||Je me considère un Hindou Sanatani, parce que:
U||1o Je crois aux Vedas, aux Upanishads, aux Puranas et à toute l’Ecriture Sainte Hindoue et par conséquent aux Avataras et à la réincarnation.
U||2o Je crois au Varnashrama dharma, dans un sens que je considère strictement Védique, mais non dans le sens populaire et grossier qu’il a aujourd’hui.
U||3o Je crois à la protection de la vache dans un sens beaucoup plus large que le sens populaire.
U||4o J’admets l’adoration des idoles.
U||Le lecteur remarquera que j’ai évité avec intention d’employer le mot d’origine divine, en parlant des Vedas et autres livres saints. Je ne crois pas à la divinité exclusive des Vedas. Ma foi dans les livres saints hindous n’exige pas que j’en accepte chaque mot et chaque verset comme inspiré par une divinité. Je n’ai pas la prétention de connaître ces livres merveilleux dans l’original, mais je prétends en avoir compris le sens et saisi l’esprit. Je ne veux pas être forcé d’adopter une interprétation quelconque, si elle répugne à ma raison ou à mon sens moral. Je n’admets certainement pas la prétention des Shankaracharyas et des Shastris actuels (s’ils l’ont vraiment) de donner des livres saints hindous une interprétation correcte. Je crois au contraire que notre connaissance actuelle de ces livres saints est extrêmement confuse. Je crois implicitement à l’aphorisme hindou 281 que nul ne connaît véritablement les Shastras s’il n’a atteint la perfection de l
U||’innocence (Ahimsa), de la vérité (Satya), et de la maîtrise de soi (Brahmacharya) et s’il n’a renoncé à acquérir, ou à posséder des richesses. Je crois aux gurus (sages) mais à notre époque des millions doivent se passer de Gurus parce qu’il est rare de trouver ensemble la pureté parfaite et le savoir parfait. Mais il ne faut jamais désespérer de connaître la vérité de sa religion, car les principes fondamentaux de l’Hindouïsme comme ceux de toute religion élevée ne varient point et sont faciles à comprendre. Tout Hindou croit que Dieu existe et qu’Il est Un, croit à la Réincarnation et au Salut. Mais ce qui distingue l’Hindouïsme de toute autre religion, c’est sa protection de la vache beaucoup plus que son Varnashrama.
U||Selon moi, le Varnashrama est inhérent à la nature humaine, et l’Hindouïsme en a fait tout simplement une science. Il est héréditaire; un homme ne peut changer de varna s’il en a le désir. Ne pas rester fidèle à son varna, c’est mépriser les lois de l’hérédité. Toutefois la division en castes innombrables vient de ce que l’on a pris des libertés injustifiables avec la doctrine.
U||Je ne crois pas que les repas en commun ou les mariages entre castes privent nécessairement un homme du rang qu’il possède par sa naissance. Les quatre divisions définissent les vocations d’un homme et n’ont pas pour but de régler ou de restreindre ses rapports avec la société. Je considère qu’il est contraire au génie de l’Hindouïsme d’attribuer à autrui un rang inférieur ou de s’en arroger un supérieur. Tous les hommes sont nés pour servir la création 282 de Dieu, le Brahmane par son savoir, le Kchattriya par sa force protectrice, le Vaichya par son habileté commerciale, et le Shudra par son travail corporel. Cela ne veut pas dire cependant qu’un Brahmane soit dispensé de tout travail corporel, ni du devoir de veiller sur les autres et sur lui-même, mais que par sa naissance il est d’abord un homme instruit, celui qui par hérédité et par éducation est le plus capable d’instruire les autres. Et de même, il n’y a rien qui empêche le Shudra d’acquérir toutes les
U|| connaissances qu’il désire, il servira mieux avec son corps et n’a pas à envier aux autres les qualités particulières de leurs fonctions. Mais un brahmane qui prétend à la supériorité à cause de son droit au savoir est déchu et n’en possède plus. Et il en est de même de tous les autres s’ils se vantent de leurs qualités particulières. Le Varnashrama, c’est l’empire sur soi-même, l’économie et la conservation de l’énergie.
U||Quoique le Varnashrama ne soit donc aucunement affecté par des mariages entre castes ou des repas en commun, il n’en est pas moins vrai que l’Hindouisme les déconseille sérieusement l’un et l’autre. L’Hindouisme a atteint le plus haut degré d’empire de soi. Cette religion est certainement basée sur le renoncement de la chair afin de libérer l’esprit. Ce n’est point le devoir d’un Hindou de prendre ses repas avec son fils. En restreignant son choix d’une épouse à un groupe particulier il fait preuve d’un rare renoncement. La religion Hindoue ne considère aucunement le mariage comme nécessaire au salut; au contraire, le mariage est une chute comme la naissance en est une. Le salut consiste 283 à se libérer de la naissance et par suite de la mort. Pour arriver à une évolution rapide de l’âme, la défense de se marier entre castes et de dîner ensemble est donc essentielle, mais cette contrainte ne met aucunement à l’épreuve le Varna. Un Brahmane reste un Brahmane même
U|| en dînant avec un frère Shudra, s’il n’a pas cessé de servir par son savoir. D’après ce qui précède, il s’ensuit que les instructions données pour le mariage et pour les repas ne sont pas basées sur un sentiment de supériorité ou d’infériorité. Un Hindou qui refuse de dîner avec un autre Hindou parce qu’il se croit supérieur se méprend sur le sens de son Dharma.
U||Il semble malheureusement aujourd’hui que l’Hindouïsme consiste uniquement à manger ou à ne pas manger avec tel ou tel. Un jour il m’est arrivé de remplir d’horreur un pieux Hindou en acceptant du pain grillé chez un Musulman. Je vis qu’il souffrait de me voir verser du lait dans une tasse qu’un musulman tenait à la main, et son angoisse ne connut plus de bornes lorsqu’il me vit accepter le pain grillé des mains de celui-ci. La religion Hindoue court le risque de perdre ce qu’elle a d’essentiel si elle finit par n’être qu’une question de règles compliquées sur ce qu’on doit manger et avec qui. S’abstenir des liqueurs enivrantes, de stupéfiants, et de toute espèce d’aliments, principalement de viande, est d’un grand secours pour l’évolution de l’âme, mais ce n’est nullement une fin en soi-même. Bien des hommes qui mangent de la viande et avec n’importe qui et qui vivent dans la crainte de Dieu sont plus rapprochés de leur libération que ceux qui s’absti
U||ennent religieusement de viande et de beaucoup d’autres choses 284 et ne cessent de blasphémer le nom de Dieu dans chacune de leurs actions.
U||Le point le plus important de l’Hindouisme est la protection de la vache. La protection de la vache me paraît le plus admirable phénomène de l’évolution humaine. Elle porte l’être humain au delà de son espèce. Pour moi la vache représente tout le monde sub-humain; l’homme doit voir en elle sa ressemblance avec tout ce qui existe. La raison pour laquelle la vache fut choisie pour cet honneur me semble évidente. La vache était la meilleure compagne dans l’Inde, elle était la dispensatrice de l’abondance. Non seulement elle donnait son lait mais rendait possible les travaux agricoles. La vache est un poème de compassion. Cette bête pacifique respire la compassion. Elle est la nourrice de millions d’êtres humains dans l’Inde. La protection de la vache signifie la protection de toutes les créatures muettes créées par Dieu. L’antique prophète, quel qu’il fut, donna le premier rang à la vache. Les espèces inférieures nous adressent un appel d’autant plus puissant qu’il e
U||st muet. La protection de la vache est un don fait par la religion hindoue à l’humanité, et l’Hindouisme durera aussi longtemps qu’il restera des Hindous pour protéger la vache.
U||La façon de la protéger est de mourir pour elle. C’est renier l’Hindouisme et Ahimsa que tuer un être humain pour sauver une vache. Les Hindous doivent protéger la vache par leur tapasya (pénitence), par leur purification et par le sacrifice. La protection de la vache a dégénéré, elle est devenue de nos jours une cause de querelles continuelles avec les Musulmans, alors que le sens véritable en serait de 285 gagner les Musulmans par notre amour. Un ami musulman m’a envoyé il y a quelque temps un livre décrivant tous les traitements inhumains que nous faisons subir à la vache et à sa progéniture: comment, pour avoir jusqu’à la dernière goutte de son lait nous la trayons jusqu’au sang, comment nous la laissons mourir de faim jusqu’à la rendre étique, comment nous maltraitons ses veaux et les privons du lait dont ils ont besoin et auquel ils ont droit, avec quelle cruauté nous traitons les bœufs, comment nous les châtrons, les assommons de coups de bâton et leur faisons traîn
U||er des charges trop lourdes. S’ils pouvaient parler ils témoigneraient contre nous et dévoileraient les crimes abominables que nous avons commis envers eux et qui stupéfieraient le monde. Chaque fois que nous sommes cruels envers eux nous renions Dieu et l’Hindouisme.....
U||Ce n’est pas par la marque qu’ils se font au front (tilak), ni par leur psalmodie exacte des Mantras, ni par leur observance des règles de castes que les Hindous seront jugés mais par leur protection de la vache. Alors que nous prétendons appartenir à la religion qui la protège, nous l’avons réduite à l’esclavage et sommes devenus nous-mêmes des esclaves.
U||On comprendra maintenant pourquoi je me considère un Hindou Sanatani: personne n’a plus que moi le respect de la vache. J’ai fait de la cause du Califat une cause personnelle parce que je considère qu’en la sauvant nous assurons la protection de la vache. Je ne demande pas à mes amis Musulmans de la protéger en remercîment de mes services. Mais journellement ma prière monte vers Dieu.... afin 286 qu’il change le cœur des Musulmans et les remplisse de compassion pour les Hindous leur prochain, et qu’ils sauvent l’animal aussi précieux pour l’Hindou que sa vie même...
U||Il m’est aussi impossible de décrire mes sentiments pour la religion hindoue que mes sentiments pour ma femme. Elle m’émeut plus que toute autre femme. Non qu’elle soit sans défaut; il est même probable qu’elle en a beaucoup plus que je ne lui en vois. Mais je sens qu’il existe entre nous un lien indissoluble. Mes sentiments pour l’Hindouisme malgré ses défauts et ce qui lui manque sont de même. Rien ne me transporte autant que la musique de la Gita ou du Ramayana de Tulcidas, les deux seuls livres de la religion hindoue que je connaisse vraiment. Lorsque je me croyais près de rendre le dernier soupir, la Gita fut ma consolation. Je n’ignore pas les vices qui existent aujourd’hui dans tous les grands sanctuaires Hindous mais je les aime malgré leurs défauts indicibles. J’y trouve un intérêt que je ne trouve pas ailleurs. Je suis jusqu’à la moelle un réformateur, mais mon zèle ne va pas jusqu’à me faire rejeter une seule des choses essentielles à la religion hindoue. J
U||ai dit que j’admettais le culte des idoles. Une idole n’excite en moi aucun sentiment de vénération; mais je crois que le culte des idoles est naturel à l’homme. Nous aspirons au symbolisme. Pourquoi serait-on plus recueilli à l’église qu’ailleurs? Les images aident au culte. Aucun Hindou ne considère qu’une image soit Dieu. Je ne considère pas que le culte des idoles soit péché.
U||Il est clair d’après ce qui précède que l’Hindouisme n’est pas une religion exclusive: il y a place dans son sein pour le culte de tous les prophètes du monde. 287 Ce n’est pas une religion qui se propage par des missions, quoique bien entendu elle ait réuni mainte tribu à son troupeau, mais elle l’a fait progressivement et imperceptiblement.
U||Telle étant ma façon d’entendre l’Hindouisme, je n’ai jamais pu admettre «l’Intouchabilité», que j’ai toujours considérée comme une excroissance maligne. Il est certain qu’elle nous a été transmise depuis des générations, mais c’est le cas de bien des mauvaises pratiques aujourd’hui. J’aurais honte de croire que la consécration des jeunes filles à une prostitution virtuelle fait partie de l’Hindouisme, quoique cette pratique existe encore chez les Hindous dans certaines régions de l’Inde. Je considère que c’est une preuve absolue d’irréligion de sacrifier des chèvres à Kali, et je ne crois pas que cela fasse partie de la religion hindoue. L’Hindouisme s’est développé avec les siècles. Son nom même fut donné à la religion du peuple de l’Hindoustan par des étrangers. Sans aucun doute à une certaine époque, des animaux étaient offerts en sacrifice au nom de la religion. Mais ce n’est pas de la religion; encore moins de la religion hindoue. C’est po
U||urquoi j’imagine que lorsque la protection de la vache devint chez nos ancêtres un article de foi, ceux qui persistèrent à manger du bœuf furent excommuniés. La lutte civile fut probablement féroce. Non seulement les coupables récalcitrants furent boycottés socialement, mais leur faute retomba sur la tête de leurs enfants. Cette mesure fut probablement appliquée au début dans les meilleures intentions, puis elle augmenta de sévérité, et certains versets ajoutés à nos livres saints lui donnèrent un caractère durable que rien ne justifiait et qu’elle 288 ne méritait pas. Que ma théorie soit juste ou non, l’intouchabilité répugne à la raison et à l’instinct de pitié et d’amour. Une religion qui a institué le culte de la vache ne peut vraiment pas admettre cette mise à l’index inhumaine d’êtres humains. J’aimerais mieux être mis en pièces que de renier les classes supprimées. Les Hindous ne mériteront jamais la liberté et ne l’obtiendront jamais s’ils permette
U||nt à leur noble religion d’être défigurée par la souillure de l’intouchabilité. Et comme l’Hindouisme m’est plus précieux que l’existence, cette souillure est pour moi un fardeau intolérable. Ne renions pas Dieu en refusant au cinquième de notre race le droit de vivre avec le reste sur un pied d’égalité.

U||SALAIRES ET VALEURS[88]
U||Discours prononcé à Ahmedabad devant les ouvriers des filatures à l’occasion du second anniversaire du conflit de 1912 entre le propriétaire des filatures et ses ouvriers.
U||«Mon intention n’est pas d’examiner en quoi consiste 289 le devoir du capitaliste. Si même l’ouvrier était seul à comprendre ses droits et ses responsabilités et qu’il n’employât que les moyens les plus purs, tous 290 deux y gagneraient. Mais deux choses sont indispensables: les revendications de l’ouvrier et les moyens adoptés pour les obtenir doivent être justes et clairs. 291 Il est illicite de la part de l’ouvrier de chercher uniquement à profiter de la situation du capitaliste. Mais il est parfaitement licite qu’il réclame un gain suffisant 292 pour subvenir à ses besoins et pouvoir élever ses enfants convenablement. Chercher à obtenir ce qui est juste sans recourir à la violence et par l’intermédiaire d’un arbitrage faire appel au bon-sens du capitaliste est un moyen tout à fait licite.
U||Pour y arriver il faut que vous possédiez des unions ouvrières. On a déjà commencé, et j’espère que dans chacun de vos services les ouvriers des filatures vont se grouper et que chacun observera scrupuleusement les règles établies par l’Union à laquelle il appartient. Vous vous adresserez aux propriétaires des filatures par l’intermédiaire de ces unions et si vous n’êtes pas satisfaits de leur décision vous aurez recours à l’arbitrage. Il est très satisfaisant de voir que de part et d’autre le principe de l’arbitrage a été accepté. J’espère qu’on va lui donner de plus en plus d’importance et que les grèves deviendront impossibles. Je sais que l’ouvrier possède le droit inhérent de faire grève afin d’obtenir justice, mais dès que les capitalistes acceptent le principe de l’arbitrage, les grèves devront être considérées comme un crime. Il y a progrès dans les méthodes employées et tout permet d’espérer que ce progrès continuera. Mais une diminution d
U||es heures de travail est également nécessaire. Il paraît que les ouvriers des filatures travaillent douze heures par jour ou davantage.
U||Les filateurs me disent que les ouvriers sont paresseux, qu’ils ne consacrent pas tout leur temps à leur travail et qu’ils se laissent distraire. Personnellement je ne suis pas surpris que l’attention de gens qui sont au travail douze heures par jour laisse à désirer. Seulement je m’attendrai certainement, 293 lorsque les heures de travail seront réduites à dix, à ce que les ouvriers travaillent mieux et qu’ils fournissent dans cet intervalle à peu près la même somme de travail qu’en douze. En Angleterre, la diminution des heures de travail a donné des résultats très satisfaisants. Lorsque les ouvriers auront appris à prendre à cœur l’intérêt de leurs patrons, ils s’élèveront et l’industrie de notre pays également. Je demande donc instamment aux propriétaires des filatures de réduire de deux heures le nombre d’heures de travail et j’insiste auprès des ouvriers pour que la production dans les dix heures soit la même que dans les douze.
U||Il faut que nous voyons à présent quelle sera la meilleure façon d’employer l’augmentation de salaire et les heures de liberté. Le remède serait pire que le mal si l’augmentation ne devait servir qu’à aller boire et si les heures de liberté devaient se passer dans quelque tripot. Il faut évidemment que l’argent soit employé pour l’éducation des enfants et les heures de liberté pour nous instruire nous-mêmes. Les directeurs peuvent faire beaucoup pour eux. Ils peuvent organiser des restaurants à bon marché où les ouvriers trouveront du lait frais et bon et d’autres rafraîchissements sains. Ils peuvent installer des salles de lecture et procurer à leurs ouvriers des distractions morales. Si on entoure les ouvriers d’une atmosphère pure le besoin de boire et de jouer disparaîtra. Les Unions devraient également s’occuper de ces questions. Elles feront œuvre plus utile en fournissant à l’ouvrier les moyens de se perfectionner intérieurement qu’en luttant contre le capi
U||taliste.
U||294
U||Lorsque de jeunes enfants sont obligés de quitter l’école pour travailler, c’est un signe d’avilissement national. Aucune nation digne de ce nom ne devrait se permettre d’abuser ainsi de ses enfants. Les enfants devraient fréquenter l’école jusqu’à l’âge de seize ans. Il faut également que peu à peu on arrache les femmes au travail des filatures. Si l’homme et la femme sont dans la vie des associés ils ne peuvent devenir de bons chefs de famille qu’en se divisant le travail. Une mère intelligente trouve dans les soins à donner à son ménage et à ses enfants l’emploi de tout son temps. Mais, lorsque le mari et la femme travaillent tous deux au dehors pour subvenir aux besoins de la famille, la nation s’avilit. Elle ressemble à un failli qui vivrait sur son capital.
U||S’il est nécessaire de développer l’esprit des ouvriers en les instruisant et en instruisant leurs enfants, il est nécessaire également de développer leur sens moral, et par là le sentiment religieux. Le monde n’en veut pas à ceux qui ont en Dieu une foi sincère et qui comprennent la vraie nature de la religion; et en tout cas leur douceur calmerait la colère de leur adversaire. Avoir de la religion ne signifie pas ici simplement faire sa namaz (prière) ou aller au temple, mais se connaître soi-même et connaître Dieu et, de même que le tisserand ne saurait tisser sans avoir appris, l’homme ne peut se connaître lui-même s’il ne se soumet à certaines règles. Il en est trois principales qui doivent être observées universellement. D’abord la pratique de la vérité. Qui ne sait pas dire la vérité ressemble à une pièce fausse sans valeur.
U||La seconde est de ne pas faire de mal à autrui. 295 Quiconque fait souffrir les autres, en est jaloux, n’est pas fait pour vivre dans le monde, car le monde se ligue contre lui, et il est contraint de vivre dans une crainte perpétuelle. Nous sommes tous unis par le lien de l’amour, il se trouve en toutes choses une force centripète sans laquelle rien n’existerait. Les hommes de science nous disent que sans la force de cohésion retenant les atomes qui composent le globe, celui-ci se réduirait en miettes et nous cesserions de vivre; et de même que cette force de cohésion existe dans la nature inerte elle existe également dans les choses vivantes et le monde; cette force de cohésion qui réunit les êtres c’est l’amour. Nous la remarquons entre père et fils, entre frères et sœurs, entre amis; seulement il faut que nous arrivions à l’utiliser pour unir tout ce qui vit car c’est en l’employant que nous connaîtrons Dieu. Où est l’amour est la vie; la haine conduit à la destruction
U||.
U||La troisième règle consiste à dominer ses passions. On lui donne en sanscrit le nom de Brahmacharya.[89] Je ne l’emploie pas ici dans le sens restreint 296 qu’il a d’ordinaire. Il n’est pas un Brahmachari même s’il est célibataire ou mène une vie chaste tout en étant marié, celui qui s’abandonne à des 297 jouissances diverses. Celui-là seul qui sait réprimer toutes ses passions peut se connaître lui-même. Celui-là seul qui a de l’empire sur lui-même dans le 298 sens le plus large est également un Brahmachari, un homme de foi, un véritable Hindou ou un véritable Mahométan.
U||299
U||On viole le Brahmacharya en écoutant un langage équivoque ou des chansons obscènes. Dire de grossières injures au lieu de répéter le nom de Dieu c’est être licencieux en paroles; et il en est de même pour tous nos autres sens. Celui-là seul peut être considéré comme un homme véritable qui a dominé toutes ses passions et possède un empire sur soi absolu. Nous sommes comme le cavalier qui ne sait pas maîtriser son cheval et qui est rapidement désarçonné; mais celui qui tient les guides d’une main ferme sait se faire obéir et a quelque chance d’arriver à sa destination. De même, l’homme qui sait dominer ses passions se dirige vers le but désiré. Lui seul est digne du Swarajya. Lui seul cherche la vérité; lui seul devient capable de connaître Dieu. Mon désir le plus sincère, c’est que vous ne considériez pas ces remarques comme des maximes de 300 cahier d’écriture. Je vous demande de croire que nous ne ferons jamais de progrès tant que nous n’attacherons pas à la pr
U||atique de ces vérités leur véritable valeur. Je vous ai communiqué un peu de l’expérience que j’ai acquise. Ce que je fais pour vous je le fais uniquement par amour pour vous, je partage vos peines parce que je crois ainsi me justifier devant mon Créateur.
U||Quand bien même vos gages seraient quadruplés et vos heures de travail quatre fois moins longues, à quoi cela vous servirait-il, si vous ne savez la valeur de la parole vraie, si Rakshasa qui existe en nous, vous incite à faire souffrir les autres et à lâcher la bride à vos passions! Il nous faut des salaires plus élevés et moins d’heures de travail parce que nous voulons la propreté de nos demeures, de nos corps, de nos esprits et de nos âmes. Et nous luttons pour obtenir cette augmentation de salaires et cette diminution d’heures de travail parce que nous considérons ces deux conditions indispensables pour cette quadruple propreté. Si tel n’était notre but en les demandant nous agirions mal en essayant de les obtenir. Que Dieu vous accorde le pouvoir nécessaire pour y arriver!

U||LA GRANDE SENTINELLE
U||Le barde de Shantiniketan a fait paraître dans la Modern Review un article remarquable sur le mouvement actuel. C’est une série d’images verbales comme seul le Poète sait en peindre. C’est une éloquente protestation contre l’autorité, contre la mentalité d’esclave ou quelque nom que l’on puisse donner à l’acceptation aveugle d’une folie passagère sous l’influence de la crainte ou de l’espérance. C’est un conseil salutaire et bienvenu à tous les travailleurs pour la cause, de ne pas imposer leur autorité quelque grande qu’elle soit. Le poète nous dit brièvement de ne rien admettre qui ne parle pas à notre raison ou à notre cœur. Si nous voulons obtenir le Swaraj il nous faut être pour la Vérité telle que nous la connaissons et à n’importe quel prix. Le réformateur qui s’irrite de ne pas voir adopter son message doit se retirer dans la forêt afin d’apprendre à veiller, attendre et prier. On ne peut qu’approuver ceci de tout cœur. Le Poète mérite les rem
U||ercîments de ses compatriotes pour sa défense de la Vérité et de la Raison. Il est certain que nous serons moins avancés qu’au début si nous donnons notre raison à garder à quelqu’un, et je serais navré si je m’apercevais que le pays s’est laissé conduire aveuglément et sans réflexion par ce que 302 j’ai pu dire ou faire. Je me rends parfaitement compte que la soumission aveugle à ceux que l’on aime peut être plus nuisible que la soumission forcée au fouet du tyran. On peut nourrir quelque espoir pour l’esclave de la brute, aucun pour l’esclave de l’amour. L’amour est nécessaire pour donner de la force à ceux qui sont faibles. L’amour devient tyrannique lorsqu’il exige l’obéissance de celui qui ne croit pas. Marmotter un mantra (prière hindoue) si l’on en ignore la valeur n’est point viril. Il est donc excellent que le poète conseille à tous ceux qui se sont laissés entraîner à imiter servilement l’appel au «charka» (rouet) de déclarer franchement qu
U||’ils n’y croient pas. Son article sert à nous mettre en garde, nous tous qui avons tendance, dans notre impatience, à nous montrer intolérants et même violents envers ceux qui ne partagent pas notre opinion. Je considère le Poète comme une sentinelle qui nous prévient de l’approche d’ennemis nommés Bigoterie, Léthargie, Intolérance, Inertie et autres membres de la même engeance.
U||Seulement, si je suis d’accord avec le poète sur la nécessité de veiller de crainte de ne plus penser, on ne doit pas imaginer que j’adopte son point de vue au sujet de l’obéissance aveugle qu’il croit exister actuellement sur une grande échelle dans l’Inde. Je me suis adressé certainement à la raison et je puis lui dire en toute certitude que si le pays est heureusement arrivé à croire que le rouet apporte l’abondance, ce n’est qu’après avoir longuement réfléchi et beaucoup hésité. Je ne suis même pas certain que l’Inde cultivée se soit assimilé la vérité qui se cache sous la charka. Qu’il ne prenne pas la poussière superficielle pour la substance qu’elle recouvre! Qu’il pénètre 303 plus au fond et qu’il se rende compte par lui-même si c’est une foi aveugle qui a fait accepter le «charka» ou une nécessité raisonnée.
U||Je demande en effet au Poète aussi bien qu’au sage de considérer le rouet comme un sacrement. Pendant une guerre, le poète pose sa lyre, le magistrat laisse là ses dossiers et l’écolier ses livres. Le poète chantera la mélodie convenable, une fois la guerre terminée, le magistrat retournera à ses livres de droit lorsque les gens auront le loisir de se battre entre eux. Lorsqu’une maison brûle, tous ceux qui l’habitent sortent et chacun saisit un seau pour éteindre l’incendie. Quand tous ceux qui m’entourent meurent de faim, la seule occupation qui me soit permise est de les nourrir. Je suis convaincu que l’Inde est une maison qui flambe, car chaque jour sa vigueur se consume, elle meurt d’inanition faute d’avoir une occupation qui lui permette d’acheter des aliments. Khulna est affamé, non parce que le peuple n’est pas capable de travailler, mais parce qu’il n’a pas de travail. Les «Ceded Districts» passent par une quatrième famine, Orissa souffre d’une famine chron
U||ique. Nos villes ne sont pas l’Inde. L’Inde vit dans ses 70 ou 80 millions de villages, et les villes se nourrissent à leurs dépens. Leurs richesses ne viennent pas des autres pays. Les gens des villes sont des agents de change, des commissionnaires en marchandises, des représentants pour les grandes maisons de commerce de l’Europe, du Japon et de l’Amérique. Les villes coopèrent avec ces derniers pour continuer à saigner nos villages, comme elles le font depuis deux cents ans. J’ai la certitude, fondée sur l’expérience, que la pauvreté de l’Inde s’accroît chaque jour. La circulation ne se 304 fait plus dans ses membres inférieurs. Si nous ne prenons garde, elle finira par défaillir tout à fait.
U||La seule forme possible sous laquelle Dieu ose se montrer à un peuple affamé et oisif, c’est le travail et la promesse de nourriture comme gages. Dieu a voulu en créant l’homme qu’il vive de son travail, et a dit que ceux qui mangeraient sans travailler seraient des voleurs. Quatre vingt pour cent des habitants de l’Inde sont par force des voleurs, la moitié de l’année. Est-il surprenant que l’Inde soit devenue une vaste prison? La faim, voilà ce qui mène l’Inde au rouet. L’appel du rouet est le plus noble de tous. Parce que c’est un appel d’amour. Et l’amour c’est le Swaraj. Il nous faut songer aux milliers d’êtres humains qui sont plus maltraités que des animaux et qui se meurent. Le rouet est le breuvage qui ramène à la vie des milliers de nos compatriotes, hommes et femmes. Pourquoi, me dira-t-on peut-être, faut-il que ceux qui n’ont pas besoin de filer pour se nourrir se mettent au rouet? Parce que je mange ce qui ne m’appartient pas. Je vis de la spoliation de 
U||mes compatriotes. Suivez le trajet de la petite pièce de monnaie qui arrive dans votre poche, et vous reconnaîtrez la vérité de ce que j’avance. Le Swaraj ne représente rien aux millions d’individus qui ne savent comment employer leur inactivité forcée. Nous obtiendrons le Swaraj prochainement, mais nous n’y arriverons que par la renaissance du rouet.
U||Je tiens au progrès, je tiens à la détermination personnelle, à la liberté, mais je les veux pour l’âme. Je doute que l’âge de l’acier soit supérieur à l’âge de pierre. Peu m’importe. C’est à l’évolution de l’âme qu’il nous faut consacrer toute notre intelligence et 305 toutes nos autres facultés. Je n’éprouve pas la moindre difficulté à imaginer qu’un homme portant l’armure moderne puisse faire une découverte importante et durable pour l’humanité, mais il m’est encore plus facile d’imaginer que celui qui ne possède rien qu’un caillou et un clou pour éclairer sa route peut chanter des hymnes nouvelles de louange et d’amour et communiquer à un monde qui souffre un message de paix et de bonne volonté sur terre.
U||Je prétends qu’en perdant notre rouet nous avons perdu un de nos poumons et que nous souffrons de phtisie galopante. La restauration du rouet arrêtera le progrès de cette cruelle maladie. Il est certaines choses qu’il faut faire sous certains climats. C’est vers le rouet que sous le climat indien tous doivent tourner les yeux, pendant la période de transition tout au moins, et la majorité d’entre nous pour toujours.
U||Notre amour pour les tissus étrangers a détrôné le rouet, et c’est pourquoi je considère que porter ces tissus est un péché. Je dois avouer que je ne fais guère de distinction, ni même aucune distinction, entre l’économie politique et la morale. L’économie politique qui nuit au bien-être d’un individu ou d’une nation est immorale et par conséquent criminelle. L’économie politique qui permet à un pays d’en piller un autre est immorale. Il est criminel d’acheter des objets qui proviennent d’un travail insuffisamment rétribué et de s’en servir. Il serait criminel de ma part de me nourrir de blé américain, si en privant mon voisin le grainetier de sa clientèle je le condamne à mourir de faim. Il serait criminel également, et pour le même motif, que je porte les dernières nouveautés de Regent Street, lorsqu’en portant des vêtements filés 306 et tissés par les fileurs et les tisseurs des alentours, non seulement je m’habille mais les habille et les nourris en mê
U||me temps. Mon crime m’étant apparu tout à coup, mon devoir est de jeter dans les flammes les vêtements étrangers, de me purifier et de ne porter désormais que du Khadi grossier fabriqué par mes voisins. Et si j’apprends que ces derniers ne se remettent pas volontiers au métier qu’ils ont abandonné, je dois afin de le rendre populaire me mettre moi-même au rouet.
U||Je me permets de faire remarquer au Poète que les vêtements que je lui demande de brûler doivent être et sont à lui. Il faut que ce soient les siens. Si à sa connaissance ils avaient appartenu aux pauvres et aux indigents, il leur aurait depuis longtemps rendu ce qui leur appartenait. Quand je brûle mes vêtements étrangers, je brûle l’objet de ma honte. Je ne dois pas insulter ceux qui sont nus en leur offrant des vêtements dont ils n’ont pas besoin, au lieu de leur donner du travail dont ils ont un besoin pressant. Je ne veux pas commettre le crime de devenir leur protecteur; seulement si j’apprends que j’ai contribué à leur pauvreté, je dois leur accorder une considération particulière, ne pas leur offrir des restes ou des vêtements qui ne me servent plus, mais leur donner ce que j’ai de mieux comme vêtements et de meilleur comme nourriture et m’associer à leur travail.
U||La Non Coopération ou «Swadeshi» n’a pas l’intention de devenir une doctrine exclusive. Je n’ai pas voulu par modestie crier sur les toits que le message de Non-coopération, de Non-Violence et de Swadeshi s’adressait au monde entier. Il ne peut que s’effondrer, 307 s’il ne porte pas de fruits sur le sol qui l’a vu naître. L’Inde n’a pas autre chose à partager pour l’instant avec le monde que sa dégradation, sa misère et ses plaies. Sont-ce ses anciens Shastras que nous devrions envoyer au monde? Ceux-ci ont paru dans diverses éditions, mais un monde incrédule et idolâtre refuse d’y jeter les yeux parce que nous qui sommes les héritiers et les dépositaires nous ne les suivons pas. Avant de songer à partager il faut posséder. Notre non-Coopération n’est dirigée ni contre les Anglais, ni contre l’Occident; elle est dirigée contre le système que les Anglais ont établi. Notre Non-Coopération est contre la civilisation matérielle, l’avidité et l’exploitation qui
U|| l’accompagnent. Notre Non-Coopération est une retraite en nous-mêmes, un refus de coopérer avec les administrateurs anglais à leurs conditions. Nous leur disons: venez, coopérez avec nous, à nos conditions, et ce sera pour notre bien, le vôtre et celui du monde entier. Il faut nous refuser à ce qu’on nous fasse perdre pied; un homme qui se noie est incapable de sauver les autres. Pour pouvoir sauver les autres, il faut d’abord être capable de se sauver soi-même. Le nationalisme indien n’est ni exclusif, ni agressif, ni destructeur. Il est salutaire et religieux et par conséquent humanitaire. Il faut que l’Inde apprenne à vivre, avant d’aspirer à mourir pour l’humanité. Les souris qui sont croquées par le chat parce qu’elles sont trop faibles pour se défendre n’ont aucun mérite à leur sacrifice forcé.
U||Fidèle à son instinct poétique, le Poète vit dans l’avenir. Il voudrait que nous fissions de même. Il montre à notre œil charmé le merveilleux tableau d’oiseaux qui prennent leur essor dans le ciel à l’aube, 308 en chantant des hymnes de louange. Ces oiseaux ont eu leur nourriture quotidienne, ils ont pris leur essor, l’aile reposée, un sang pur et nouveau ayant couru dans leurs veines pendant la nuit précédente. J’ai eu la douleur de voir des oiseaux qui, faute de forces, ne pouvaient même pas agiter leurs ailes. L’oiseau humain, sous le ciel de l’Inde, se lève plus faible qu’il ne l’était lorsqu’il a fait semblant de se reposer. Pour des milliers d’êtres humains, c’est une éternelle vigile ou une éternelle léthargie. Leur condition est si pénible qu’il faut l’avoir vue pour y croire. Je n’ai pu calmer leur souffrance par un chant de Kabir. Ceux qui ont faim réclament un seul poème fortifiant, de la nourriture. On ne peut la leur donner. Il faut qu’ils l
U||a gagnent. Et ils ne peuvent la gagner qu’à la sueur de leur front.
U||Si nous prenons soin d’aujourd’hui,
U||Dieu prendra soin du lendemain.

U||LA PEUR DE LA MORT[90]
U||J’ai réuni diverses définitions du Swaraj. Une de celles-ci serait: Le Swaraj consiste à ne pas avoir 309 peur de la mort. Une nation que la peur de la mort peut influencer n’obtiendra pas le Swaraj et l’obtiendrait-elle d’une façon quelconque, qu’elle ne saurait le conserver.
U||Les Anglais portent leur vie dans leur poche. Les Arabes et les Pathans considèrent que la mort n’est qu’un malaise comme un autre et ne pleurent jamais lorsqu’un de leurs parents meurt. Les femmes boers ignorent complètement cette crainte. Pendant la guerre des Boers des milliers de jeunes femmes devinrent veuves. Elles restaient indifférentes. Qu’importait la perte d’un époux ou d’un fils du moment que leur pays était sauvé! C’était assez et plus qu’assez. A quoi eût servi un époux si la patrie avait été réduite à l’esclavage? Mieux valait infiniment ensevelir les restes mortels d’un fils et chérir sa mémoire immortelle que de l’élever en esclave. Voilà comment les femmes boers se cuirassaient le cœur et donnaient joyeusement les êtres qui leur étaient chers à l’ange de la mort.
U||Ceux dont je viens de parler tuaient et étaient tués, mais que dire de ceux qui ne tuent pas et que l’on tue? Ceux-là deviennent l’objet de la vénération du monde, ils sont «le sel de la terre».
U||Anglais et Allemands se sont battus; ils ont tué et ils ont été tués. Comme résultat, la haine s’est accrue, il règne une agitation épouvantable et la condition actuelle de l’Europe est pitoyable. La duplicité grandit et chacun cherche à tromper les autres.
U||Le courage que nous voulons développer est d’un ordre plus élevé et c’est pour cette raison que nous espérons sous peu remporter une victoire éclatante.
U||Lorsque nous obtiendrons le Swaraj, un grand 310 nombre d’entre nous auront cessé de craindre la mort, autrement nous n’aurions pas le Swaraj. Jusqu’à présent les jeunes gens surtout sont morts pour la cause. Ceux qui ont trouvé la mort à Aligarh avaient tous moins de vingt et un ans. Personne ne savait leur nom. Si le gouvernement tirait maintenant, j’espère que certains des chefs auraient l’occasion de s’offrir au sacrifice suprême.
U||Pourquoi sommes-nous bouleversés lorsque des enfants, des jeunes gens ou des vieillards meurent? Il ne se passe pas un instant sur cette terre sans que quelqu’un meure ou vienne au monde. Nous devrions sentir à quel point il est absurde de nous réjouir d’une naissance ou de pleurer une mort. Ceux qui croient à l’existence de l’âme—et quel Hindou, Musulman ou Parsi n’y croit pas?—savent que l’âme est immortelle. L’âme des morts et l’âme des vivants n’est qu’une. Le mouvement éternel de création et de destruction se poursuit sans interruption. Il n’y a rien en lui qui doive nous transporter de joie ou nous plonger dans le désespoir. Même en n’étendant l’idée de parenté qu’à nos compatriotes, si nous considérions toutes les naissances comme ayant lieu dans notre famille, combien en célébrerions-nous? Si nous pleurions toutes les morts qui ont lieu dans notre pays, nos yeux seraient à jamais remplis de larmes. Cette pensée devrait nous aider à nous délivrer 
U||de la crainte de la mort.
U||L’Inde, dit-on, est une nation de philosophes, et nous n’avons point refusé cet éloge. Et cependant il n’est guère de nation plus désemparée que la nôtre devant la mort, et dans l’Inde, nulle communauté peut-être ne le montre autant que les Hindous. 311 Une seule naissance, et nous voilà transportés d’une joie ridicule; un décès et nous nous plongeons dans une orgie de lamentations bruyantes qui empêchent nos voisins de dormir pendant la nuit entière. Si nous voulons obtenir le Swaraj, et si, l’ayant obtenu, nous voulons en faire quelque chose dont nous puissions nous montrer fiers, il faut absolument nous guérir de cette frayeur absurde.
U||Qu’est-ce que la prison pour qui ne craint pas la mort?—Si le lecteur veut se donner la peine de réfléchir un instant, il se rendra compte que le Swaraj tarde parce que nous ne sommes pas préparés à voir sans émotion venir la mort et des inconvénients moins sérieux que la mort. A mesure que le nombre des hommes innocents prêts à accueillir la mort avec joie augmentera, leur sacrifice deviendra un instrument puissant pour le salut des autres et la souffrance sera moindre. La souffrance que l’on supporte gaiement cesse d’être souffrance et se transmue en joie ineffable. L’homme qui fuit devant la souffrance est victime de tribulations continuelles avant que celle-ci ne l’atteigne si bien qu’il est à demi-mort lorsqu’elle arrive. Celui qui est prêt à tout accepter d’un cœur serein échappe à la douleur, sa sérénité agit comme un anesthésique.
U||J’ai été conduit à écrire sur ce sujet parce qu’il nous faut envisager la mort si nous voulons avoir le Swaraj cette année. Celui qui a pris ses précautions échappe souvent aux accidents et il se peut que ce soit le cas pour nous. J’ai la ferme conviction que le Swadeshi nous y prépare. Lorsque le Swadeshi aura complètement atteint son but le gouvernement 312 ni personne ne verra la nécessité de nous faire subir d’autres épreuves.
U||Néanmoins il vaut mieux que nous soyons prêts à toute contingence. Le pouvoir rend les hommes aveugles et sourds, ils sont incapables de voir ce qui est sous leur nez ni d’entendre ce qui gronde à leurs oreilles. Il est donc impossible de savoir ce que pourra faire un gouvernement ivre de son pouvoir. Il m’a semblé nécessaire que les patriotes se préparent à la mort, à la prison et à d’autres éventualités de ce genre.
U||Les braves vont au devant de la mort le sourire aux lèvres, ce qui ne les empêche pas d’être sur leur garde. Dans cette guerre non violente, il ne s’agit pas d’être téméraires. Nous n’avons pas l’intention d’aller en prison ou de mourir par un acte immoral. C’est en résistant aux lois oppressives de ce gouvernement que nous devons monter au gibet.

U||HONOREZ LE PRINCE
U||Que le lecteur ne s’étonne pas du titre de cet article. Supposons que le Prince soit un frère par le sang et qu’il occupe un rang élevé, supposons que des voisins veuillent se servir de lui pour leurs fins honteuses, 313 supposons encore qu’il soit prisonnier de notre voisin, que ma voix ne puisse parvenir jusqu’à lui et que ces mêmes voisins l’amènent dans mon village. Est-ce que le meilleur moyen de l’honorer ne serait pas de ne prendre aucune part aux cérémonies organisées en son honneur dans l’intention de l’exploiter, et de lui faire savoir qu’on l’exploite par tous les moyens à ma disposition? Ne serais-je pas un traître si je n’essayais pas de le mettre en garde contre le piège que lui tendent mes voisins?
U||Je ne doute pas un moment que la visite du Prince soit exploitée pour faire de la réclame au «bienveillant» Gouvernement Anglais qui administre l’Inde. Si son Altesse Royale y est invitée pour son plaisir personnel et son amusement, à un moment où l’Inde bouillonne de mécontentement, où les masses sont saturées d’hostilité envers le système de gouvernement qui les administre, où la famine est intense dans le Khulna et les Ceded Districts et un conflit armé est déchaîné au Malabar, c’est un crime envers nous, c’est un crime envers l’Inde de dépenser des millions de roupies pour une simple réception lorsque des millions d’hommes meurent de faim. Huit millions de roupies ont été votés par le Conseil de Bombay rien que pour le défilé.
U||Des mesures de répression ont été prises en vue de cette visite sur tout le territoire. A Sindh, plus de cinquante Non-Coopérateurs ont été jetés en prison. Quelques-uns des plus braves Musulmans sont cités devant les tribunaux pour répondre de leurs opinions. Dix-neuf travailleurs pour la cause viennent d’être incarcérés au Bengale parmi lesquels Mr Sen Gupta, le plus célèbre avocat de l’endroit. 314 Un Pir (saint) musulman et trois autres travailleurs dévoués sont également en prison pour le même crime. Plusieurs chefs des Provinces sont emprisonnés et le meilleur d’entre eux comparaît pour avoir exprimé ce que je n’ai cessé de répéter dans les colonnes de ce journal et ce que les membres du Congrès ont dit continuellement depuis un an. Plusieurs chefs des Provinces du centre ont été privés de liberté pour le même motif. Un docteur extrêmement populaire, le docteur Paranjapye, homme universellement respecté pour son désintéressement, subit un emprisonnement sévèr
U||e, comme un vulgaire criminel. Et je suis loin d’être au bout de la liste de Non-Coopérateurs qui sont en prison. Si la visite du Prince est une épreuve pour nous inciter à commettre un vrai crime ou une réponse au mécontentement grandissant, elle est, pour ne pas dire davantage, inopportune. Il n’y a pas le moindre doute que le peuple ne désire pas une visite de son Altesse Royale aux Indes, en ce moment. Il l’a fait savoir en termes non équivoques. Il a déclaré que Bombay devait observer le hartal, le jour de son arrivée. Faire venir le Prince, malgré l’opposition du peuple, est certainement une tyrannie.
U||Dans les circonstances actuelles, quelle doit être notre attitude? Nous devons boycotter toutes les réceptions en l’honneur du Prince, nous abstenir religieusement d’assister à aucune œuvre de charité, fêtes et feux d’artifices organisés à cette intention, refuser d’illuminer et ne pas envoyer nos enfants voir les illuminations.
U||Pour cela, nous devons publier des feuilles de propagande par milliers et les distribuer parmi le 315 peuple, afin de lui montrer son devoir, et la véritable façon de rendre honneur au Prince est de faire en sorte qu’il trouve la ville déserte à son arrivée à Bombay.
U||Seulement distinguons entre le Prince et sa personne. Nous n’avons aucun sentiment d’animosité contre le Prince en tant qu’homme. Il ne sait probablement rien des sentiments de l’Inde il ignore probablement les mesures de répression. Il est probable qu’il ignore même les blessures dont le Pendjab saigne encore, qu’il ne sait point que la violation de la promesse envers l’Inde au sujet du Califat reste encore envenimée dans le cœur de tout Indien et que, de l’aveu même du Gouvernement, les membres des Conseils réformés bien qu’élus nominalement ne représentent en aucune façon les quelques cent milliers inscrits sur les listes électorales. Non seulement il serait cruel et inhumain de chercher à faire du mal au Prince, mais ce serait une trahison de notre part envers lui et envers nous-mêmes car nous avons juré de demeurer non violents. Frapper ou insulter le Prince serait de notre part faire à l’Inde et à l’Islam un tort plus grand que les Anglais n’en ont commis envers
U|| eux. Ils péchent parce qu’ils ne savent pas. Nous ne pouvons prétendre à la même ignorance. Nous avons, en connaissance de cause, promis devant Dieu et devant les hommes de ne faire mal à aucun individu appartenant de quelque façon au système de gouvernement que nous cherchons à détruire. Il est par conséquent de notre devoir de prendre toutes les précautions nécessaires pour protéger la personne du Prince, comme s’il s’agissait de nous-mêmes. Nous 316 savons qu’en dépit de tous nos efforts, certains voudront prendre part aux diverses cérémonies, par crainte, par espoir, ou par choix. Ils ont autant que nous le droit de faire ce qui leur plaît. Voilà en quoi consiste la liberté que nous voulons obtenir et dont nous voulons jouir. Tant que nous devrons subir le joug profondément irritant d’une insolente bureaucratie, exerçons un grand empire sur nous-mêmes. S’il nous est possible de démontrer la fermeté de notre résolution en ne prenant aucune part au défilé et en mont
U||rant de la tolérance vis-à-vis de ceux qui ne partagent pas notre manière de voir, nous ferons progresser très sensiblement notre cause.
U||27 octobre 1921
U||POINT DE VUE MORAL
U||Dès que nous cessons de nous appuyer sur la morale, nous cessons d’être religieux. On n’a point d’exemple de religion foulant aux pieds la morale. L’homme ne peut être cruel, menteur et incontinent, et avoir Dieu pour lui. A Bombay, les partisans de la Non-Coopération ont perdu leur équilibre moral. Indignés contre les Parsis et les Chrétiens qui prenaient part à la réception du Prince, ils ont voulu leur donner une leçon. Ils allaient au devant de représailles. 317 A partir du 17, ce fut un jeu de bascule où personne ne gagna véritablement et où tout le monde perdit.
U||Ce n’est pas ainsi que nous arriverons au Swaraj. L’Inde ne veut pas du Bolchevisme, les gens aiment trop la paix pour tolérer l’anarchie. Ils s’inclineront devant celui qui rétablira ce qu’il est convenu d’appeler ordre. Il nous faut reconnaître la psychologie de l’Inde et ne pas chercher si ce désir avide de paix est un vice ou une vertu. Le type du Musulman de l’Inde est différent du Musulman des autres parties du globe; ses rapports avec les Indiens l’ont rendu plus docile que ses coreligionnaires des autres pays. Il ne peut supporter longtemps que sa vie ou sa fortune soient exposés à un danger évident. L’Hindou est d’une douceur légendaire, au point d’en être presque méprisable. Les Parsis préfèrent la paix à la guerre. A dire vrai, nous avons presque mis la religion au service de la paix. Cette mentalité est en même temps notre faiblesse et notre force.
U||Développons donc ce qu’elle a de meilleur, son côté religieux. Que «nulle» contrainte ne soit exercée en matière de religion. N’est-ce point une religion pour nous d’observer le Swadeshi et par conséquent le Khadi? Si la religion des autres ne le leur ordonne pas d’adopter le Swadeshi, nous n’avons pas le droit de les y contraindre. Nous avons désobéi à la règle universelle exprimée à nouveau dans le Coran... S’il est mal d’exercer de la contrainte quand il s’agit de la religion où nos convictions sont définies, il est plus mal encore de le faire lorsqu’il s’agit de questions de moindre importance.
U||Tout ce que nous pouvons, c’est de raisonner avec 318 nos adversaires. Le plus loin où il nous soit permis d’aller est de Non-Coopérer avec eux dans la vie privée...
U||J’avoue que je n’ai pas toujours condamné les persécutions sociales aussi sévèrement que je l’aurais dû. J’aurais pu me séparer du mouvement, lorsque le mal s’est généralisé... Nous sommes devenus plus tolérants; néanmoins une légère coercition subsistait dont je ne tins pas compte pensant qu’elle mourrait d’elle-même. Je m’aperçus qu’à Bombay il n’en était rien. Elle affecta le 17 un caractère virulent.
U||Nous avons fait du tort à la cause du Califat et en même temps à celle du Pendjab et au Swaraj. Il faut que nous revenions sur nos pas et nous assurions scrupuleusement que les minorités ne soient en aucune façon molestées. S’il plaît aux Chrétiens de porter le chapeau et le pantalon, rien ne doit les en empêcher; si le Parsi tient à conserver son «fenta», il en a le droit absolu; si l’un et l’autre pensent qu’il y va de leur sécurité de s’associer au gouvernement, nous ne pouvons les détacher de leur erreur qu’en faisant appel à leur raison et non en leur cassant la tête. Plus nous voudrons contraindre, plus la sécurité du gouvernement sera grande, quand ce ne serait que parce que ce dernier possède des armes coercitives plus puissantes que les nôtres. Si nous avons recours à une coercition plus grande que celle du gouvernement, nous rendrons simplement l’Inde plus esclave qu’elle ne l’est déjà.
U||Le Swaraj, c’est la liberté pour chacun, pour le plus humble d’entre nous, de faire ce qu’il lui plaît, sans qu’aucun obstacle matériel soit mis en travers de cette liberté. La Non-Coopération non-violente 319 est la méthode par laquelle nous développons l’opinion publique la plus libre et la mettons en valeur. Quand il y a complète liberté d’opinion, celle de la majorité doit faire loi. Si nous faisons partie de la minorité, nous pouvons nous montrer dignes de notre religion en lui demeurant fidèle malgré la pression exercée sur nous... Par notre folie, ne retardons pas l’heure du progrès.
U||24 novembre 1921.
U||LA QUESTION DE SUPRÊME IMPORTANCE
U||D’ici quelques semaines, la Désobéissance Civile devrait battre son plein dans quelque partie de l’Inde. Le pays est familier maintenant avec la désobéissance partielle et individuelle. La Désobéissance Civile totale est une rébellion sans violence. Un champion convaincu de la Désobéissance Civile ignore purement et simplement l’autorité de l’Etat. Il se met hors la loi et prétend n’obéir à aucune des lois immorales de l’Etat. Il se refuse par exemple à payer les impôts et à reconnaître l’autorité de la loi dans ses rapports journaliers, il pénètre dans les casernes malgré la défense, afin de parler aux 320 soldats, et se poste aux endroits même où il est interdit de stationner. Dans toutes ces actions, il n’emploie jamais la force et ne résiste jamais à la force employée contre lui. Il s’expose à la prison et aux autres méthodes violentes que l’on peut employer contre lui. Il agit ainsi, lorsque et parce qu’il considère que la liberté physique dont il par
U||aît jouir est un intolérable fardeau. Il se dit que l’Etat n’accorde la liberté individuelle qu’autant que le citoyen se soumet à ses règles. Se soumettre aux lois de l’État, voilà le prix que tout citoyen doit payer pour sa liberté. Obéir à un État totalement ou largement injuste est un troc immoral de la liberté. Un citoyen qui reconnaît ainsi la nature malfaisante d’un État ne peut être satisfait d’y vivre par tolérance aux yeux de ceux qui ne partagent pas son opinion; il semble être un fléau pour la société, alors qu’il cherche uniquement et sans commettre de faute morale à se faire arrêter par l’État. La résistance civile ainsi comprise devient l’expression la plus puissante des tourments d’une âme, et une protestation éloquente contre le maintien d’un gouvernement malfaisant. N’est-ce point l’histoire de toute réforme? Les réformateurs, à la grande indignation de leurs semblables, n’ont pas rejeté même les plus innocents symboles quand ils ava
U||ient été associés à des pratiques immorales?
U||Lorsqu’un groupe d’hommes renie l’état sous la domination duquel ils ont vécu jusqu’alors, ils établissent presque leur propre gouvernement. Je dis presque, parce qu’ils ne vont pas jusqu’à employer la force lorsque l’Etat résiste. Leur affaire est de se faire jeter en prison ou fusiller par l’Etat, si celui-ci ne reconnaît pas leur indépendance, ou en d’autres 321 termes s’il ne s’incline pas devant leur volonté.
U||Ainsi, 3.000 Indiens dans l’Afrique du Sud, après avoir dûment averti le gouvernement du Transvaal, passèrent la frontière du Transvaal en 1914, défiant la loi d’immigration au Transvaal et contraignirent le gouvernement à les arrêter. Quand il ne put arriver à les provoquer à la violence ou les forcer à la soumission, il céda à leur réclamation. Un groupe de gens faisant de la résistance civile est donc comme une armée sujette à toute la discipline du soldat, mais à une discipline plus dure parce qu’il lui manque la surexcitation habituelle à la vie d’un soldat ordinaire. Et comme une armée de résistance civile est ou devrait être dégagée de l’esprit de représailles, elle requiert le moindre nombre de soldats. En vérité, un seul homme résistant civilement suffit à remporter la victoire de la Justice sur l’Injustice.
U||Le Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde a autorisé les Comités du Congrès des provinces à commencer la désobéissance civile, sous leur propre responsabilité. J’espère qu’ils donneront au mot responsabilité toute son importance et ne commenceront pas de gaieté de cœur. Toutes les conditions doivent être remplies. Parler encore d’Union Musulmane, de Non-Violence, de Swadeshi et de la suppression de l’Intouchabilité, montre que ces questions ne sont pas arrivées à faire partie intégrale de notre existence nationale... Il serait d’ailleurs préférable de veiller et d’attendre que l’expérience ait lieu dans une partie de l’Inde, tout d’abord... Les régiments qui veillent et qui attendent coopèrent aussi activement que ceux qui se battent véritablement. La seule circonstance qui pourrait autoriser une désobéissance individuelle 322 simultanée pendant que l’expérience aura lieu, serait l’opposition du gouvernement au progrès tranquille du Swadeshi; si par exemple un 
U||fileur habile qui enseigne son art et l’organise se voyait interdire cette occupation, son devoir serait de ne tenir aucun compte de l’ordre reçu et de courir le risque d’être emprisonné. Pour ce qui est de tout le reste, pendant qu’une partie du pays prendra part à l’offensive et enfreindra délibérément toutes les lois amorales de l’État qu’il lui sera possible d’enfreindre, il vaudra mieux que toutes les autres parties de l’Inde respectent scrupuleusement les ordres et les instructions données. Il est inutile d’ajouter que toute révolte violente dans une autre partie de l’Inde ferait nécessairement du tort à la tentative et même y mettrait fin. Les autres parties de l’Inde devront donc rester calmes et tranquilles, même si les habitants de la région de l’Inde où l’expérience a lieu étaient emprisonnés, criblés de balles ou traités cruellement, d’une façon quelconque par les autorités. Il nous faut être certains qu’elles se montreront à la hauteur de 
U||toutes les éventualités possibles.

U||INTROSPECTION
U||Certains correspondants m’ont écrit en termes touchants pour me demander de ne pas me suicider en janvier si nous n’avons pas obtenu le Swaraj d’ici là et si je suis encore en liberté. Je me rends compte que les mots n’expriment qu’imparfaitement la pensée, surtout lorsque la pensée elle-même est incomplète ou confuse. Je pensais avoir écrit dans le Navjivan assez clairement, mais je m’aperçois que la traduction a été mal comprise par beaucoup...
U||Une des principales raisons de l’erreur provient de ce que l’on me considère comme un homme parfait. Les amis qui connaissent mes préférences pour la Bhagavad Gita m’ont démontré que ma menace de suicide était en contradiction avec les enseignements que je cherchais à mettre en pratique et m’ont jeté à la tête les versets à l’appui. Tous ces mentors semblent oublier que je ne suis pas autre chose qu’un homme cherchant la vérité. Je prétends avoir trouvé le chemin qui mène à la Vérité, je prétends faire un effort incessant pour la découvrir, mais j’admets que je ne l’ai pas encore trouvée. Découvrir la vérité absolue, c’est se réaliser soi-même et réaliser sa destinée, c’est-à-dire atteindre la perfection. J’ai péniblement conscience de mes imperfections, et c’est 324 en cela que consiste ma force, parce qu’il est rare qu’un homme sache ce qui lui manque.
U||Si j’étais parfait, j’avoue que la misère de ceux qui m’entourent ne m’affecterait pas comme elle le fait. J’en prendrais note, je prescrirais un remède, et par la puissance immuable de la vérité qui serait en moi je le ferais adopter. Mais pour l’instant je ne puis voir qu’indistinctement comme dans un miroir, et je dois par conséquent chercher à convaincre par des méthodes lentes et laborieuses et qui ne réussissent pas toujours. Dans ces conditions, je ne serais même pas humain si, connaissant comme je le fais la misère qui règne sur ce sol et que l’on pourrait éviter, et voyant à l’ombre même du Maître de l’Univers des êtres qui ne sont que des squelettes, je n’éprouvais aucune sympathie pour les millions d’hommes qui dans l’Inde souffrent et se taisent.
U||Je suis soutenu par l’espoir que cette misère diminuera peu à peu; mais supposez que malgré toute ma sensibilité et tous mes efforts pour faire parvenir le message guérisseur du rouet au cœur de la nation l’oreille seule l’ait entendu, supposez encore que dans l’excitation des douze derniers mois il n’y ait eu dans le programme aucune foi véritable, supposez enfin que le message ne soit pas parvenu jusqu’au cœur des Anglais; ne devrais-je pas douter de mon tapasya et sentir que je ne suis plus digne de diriger la lutte? Ne devrais-je pas m’agenouiller en toute humilité devant mon Créateur et lui demander de me délivrer de mon corps inutile et de faire de moi un instrument plus capable de servir?
U||Le Swaraj consiste en un changement de gouvernement où le contrôle effectif se trouve placé entre les 325 mains du peuple. Mais ce n’en est que la forme extérieure. Ce qui en est le fond et ce que je désire ardemment, c’est une acceptation nette des moyens et par conséquent une transformation véritable du cœur chez le peuple. Je suis persuadé qu’il ne faut pas des siècles pour que les Hindous renoncent à leur péché d’intouchabilité, pour que les Hindous et les Musulmans abandonnent leur inimitié et considèrent qu’une amitié qui vient du cœur est un facteur éternel de l’existence nationale, pour que tous adoptent le Charka comme unique moyen universel permettant de sauver l’Inde au point de vue économique; enfin, pour que tous croient que la méthode Non-Violente seule donnera la liberté à l’Inde. L’adoption libre, intelligente, et décidée de ce programme par la nation suffit selon moi pour que le principe essentiel soit acquis. Le symbole, c’est-à-dire le transfer
U||t des pouvoirs, ne peut manquer de suivre, de même que la graine bien semée doit germer et devenir un arbre.
U||Le lecteur pourra donc le voir à ce que j’ai déclaré incidemment à mes amis à Poona et répété ensuite à d’autres n’était pas autre chose qu’une confession de mes imperfections, exprimant à quel point je me sentais indigne de la noble cause dont j’ai pour l’instant l’air d’être le chef. Je n’ai formulé aucune doctrine désespérée. Au contraire, je n’ai jamais été aussi convaincu que je le suis à l’heure où j’écris que nous acquerrons le principe essentiel cette année. J’ai déclaré également qu’étant idéaliste pratique je devrais me considérer comme indigne de diriger une cause, si je craignais de ne pouvoir la conduire au succès. La doctrine qui veut le travail dans le détachement signifie aussi bien la recherche inexorable 326 de la vérité que le retour sur ses pas si l’on s’est trompé, ou la renonciation sans regret du rôle de chef lorsqu’on découvre qu’on n’en est pas digne.
U||Je n’ai fait qu’esquisser imparfaitement mon désir intense de me perdre dans l’Eternel et de devenir un simple morceau d’argile entre les mains du Divin Potier, afin que mes services deviennent plus certains parce qu’ils ne seront plus entravés par mon être inférieur.

U||LE ROLE DES FEMMES
U||Les femmes de Calcutta ayant abordé des messieurs de Calcutta pour essayer de leur vendre du Khadi, un télégramme annonce dans les journaux qu’un groupe d’entre elles a été arrêté comprenant l’épouse dévouée du Président élu, sa sœur qui est veuve et sa nièce. J’avais espéré qu’au début tout au moins on épargnerait aux femmes l’honneur de la prison. Il était entendu que leur Résistance Civile ne serait pas agressive. Mais le gouvernement du Bengale dans son zèle impartial ne fait aucune différence entre les sexes et a conféré cet honneur à trois femmes de Calcutta. J’espère que le pays tout entier fera bon accueil à cette innovation. Il faut que les femmes 327 prennent part à l’établissement du Swaraj aussi bien que les hommes. Il est probable que dans cette lutte pacifique la femme l’emportera sur l’homme. Nous savons que sa dévotion religieuse est toujours plus grande que celle de l’homme, son sexe se distingue par sa souffrance silencieuse et digne. Et m
U||aintenant que le gouvernement du Bengale a traîné la femme sur le champ de bataille, j’espère que toutes les femmes du Bengale vont relever la provocation et s’organiser. En tout cas, elles étaient tenues pour l’honneur de leur sexe de remplacer les hommes lorsqu’un certain nombre d’entre eux auraient été mis hors de combat. Mais à présent, que ce soit en partageant aux côtés de l’homme les souffrances de la vie de prison! Dieu veillera sur elles...
U||Je conseillerais aux femmes de l’Inde de recueillir sans bruit et sans perdre de temps le nom de celles qui sont prêtes à s’avancer sur la ligne de feu. Que leur offre soit adressée aux femmes du Bengale et que celles-ci sentent que leurs sœurs des autres provinces sont prêtes à suivre leur noble exemple. Il est probable qu’un petit nombre seul sera disposé à courir le risque de la prison et tout ce que cela doit représenter pour une femme. La nation ne pourra qu’être fière, même si quelques-unes seulement s’offrent tout d’abord au sacrifice.

U||L’INDÉPENDANCE
U||Maulana Hasrat Mohani a défendu l’Indépendance avec beaucoup de courage, d’abord sur l’estrade du Congrès, puis comme Président de la Ligue Musulmane, et il a été heureusement battu chaque fois. Il est impossible de se méprendre sur le sens des paroles du Maulana: il voudrait rompre tout rapport avec le peuple britannique même à titre d’associé et d’égal, et quand bien même la question du Califat aurait été résolue d’une façon satisfaisante. Il n’est pas bon d’avancer que la question du Califat ne saurait être résolue sans une indépendance absolue. Nous ne faisons qu’en discuter la théorie. S’il faut l’indépendance absolue pour que la question du Califat soit résolue, c’est-à-dire si le peuple britannique se montre toujours hostile aux aspirations du monde musulman, nous n’avons d’autre parti à prendre que d’insister pour l’avoir, il y va de l’intérêt commun. L’Inde ne peut se permettre de donner à l’Angleterre, ne fût-ce que son appui moral, 
U||et doit se passer de l’appui moral et matériel de l’Angleterre si elle ne peut la décider à se montrer bien disposée à l’égard de l’Islam.
U||Mais si nous supposons que la Grande-Bretagne change d’attitude, et je sais qu’elle le fera lorsqu’elle se rendra compte que l’Inde est forte, il serait illégitime au point de vue religieux de continuer à réclamer 329 l’Indépendance. Ce procédé serait déplacé et vindicatif, il équivaudrait à nier l’existence de Dieu, car ce refus serait alors fondé sur la supposition que le peuple britannique est incapable de répondre au Dieu qui se trouve en chacun de nous, principe qui ne saurait se défendre ni par le Musulman croyant, ni par l’Hindou croyant.
U||L’Inde devra mettre toute sa gloire, non à traiter les Anglais en ennemis qu’il faut expulser à la première occasion, mais à s’en faire des amis et des associés dans la nouvelle république de nations qui remplacera un empire basé sur l’exploitation des races et des nations plus faibles de la terre et par conséquent sur la force.
U||Voyons clairement quel sera le sens du Swaraj si nous conservons nos rapports avec la Grande-Bretagne. Assurément, c’est la possibilité pour l’Inde de déclarer son indépendance si elle le désire. Le Swaraj ne sera donc pas un don gratuit du Parlement Britannique. Ce sera la déclaration du droit de l’Inde à être représentée entièrement. Sans doute le Swaraj sera exprimé par un Acte du Parlement; mais cet acte ne sera qu’une ratification courtoise du vœu exprimé par le peuple de l’Inde, comme ce fut le cas pour l’Afrique du Sud. La Chambre des Communes ne put en modifier un seul adverbe. La ratification, en ce qui nous concerne, sera un traité où la Grande-Bretagne sera intéressée.
U||Il est possible que ce Swaraj-là nous ne l’obtenions pas cette année, peut-être pas avant une autre génération; mais je n’ai jamais songé à rien de moins. Lorsque le moment de l’accord sera venu, le Parlement Anglais ratifiera les vœux du peuple de 330 l’Inde, non par la voie de la bureaucratie, mais par l’intermédiaire des représentants que celle-ci se sera choisis librement.
U||Le Swaraj ne pourra jamais être le don d’une nation à une autre. C’est un trésor qu’il faut acheter au prix du sang le plus pur de la nation. Ce ne sera plus un don lorsque nous l’aurons payé chèrement. Le Vice-Roi s’est trompé en disant qu’il faudrait bien que le Swaraj nous vînt du Parlement Britannique s’il ne nous venait par l’épée. Il n’était guère flatteur pour son pays de laisser entendre à ses auditeurs que l’Angleterre était incapable de prêter l’oreille à la pression morale de la souffrance, il faisait injure à leur intelligence s’il voulait leur faire croire que le Parlement Britannique donnerait le Swaraj à l’Inde quand il le voudrait, sans se soucier de ses désirs et de ses aspirations. En réalité, le Swaraj sera le fruit d’un incessant labeur et d’intenses souffrances...

U||LETTRE DE M. GANDHI AU VICE-ROI
U||A Son Excellence le Vice-Roi des Indes, Delhi.
U||Monsieur,
U||Bardoli est un petit Tehsil du district de Sura 331 dans la Présidence de Bombay, qui compte environ 87000 habitants, tout compris.
U||Il a décidé le 29 janvier dernier, sous la présidence de M. Vithalbhai Patel, d’entreprendre la Désobéissance Civile, ayant démontré qu’il remplissait les conditions requises par le Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde qui s’était réuni le 1er novembre. Mais comme je suis peut-être en grande partie responsable de la résolution prise par Bardoli, je considère que je dois à votre Excellence et au Public d’expliquer les raisons qui ont amené cette décision.
U||Le Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde, dans la réunion à laquelle j’ai déjà fait allusion, avait décidé que Bardoli serait le premier bataillon à entreprendre la Désobéissance Civile, afin de marquer la révolte de la nation contre le gouvernement pour son refus criminel et persistant d’apprécier à sa juste valeur la décision de l’Inde au sujet du Califat, du Pendjab et du Swaraj.
U||Puis, le 17 novembre dernier, eut lieu l’émeute regrettable et malheureuse de Bombay qui nous força de remettre l’action projetée par Bardoli.
U||Entre temps, commença avec l’approbation du Gouvernement de l’Inde, une répression des plus virulentes au Bengale, dans l’Assam, dans les Provinces Unies, au Pendjab, dans la province de Delhi et jusqu’à un certain point dans le Bihav Orissa et ailleurs.
U||Je sais que le mot répression employé pour décrire l’action des autorités vous déplaît. A mon avis une mesure qui dépasse ce que demande la situation n’est pas autre chose que de la répression. Piller les biens, assaillir les innocents, traiter les prisonniers avec 332 brutalité et les fouetter ne peut être considéré comme une action permise ou nécessaire. On ne peut qualifier cette infraction officielle aux lois que du nom de répression illégale. Il est possible d’admettre, jusqu’à un certain point, que les Non-Coopérateurs et leurs partisans ont procédé par intimidation lors des hartal... mais ceci ne saurait justifier l’interdiction en bloc des réunions publiques paisibles et de l’enrôlement paisible des volontaires, en donnant un sens détourné à une loi dirigée contre des activités manifestement violentes d’intention et d’action; et de même on ne peut désigner autrement que par le mot de répression les poursuites contre des gens innocents selon une application
U|| illégale, à notre avis, de la loi ordinaire, ou l’atteinte portée à la liberté de la presse en s’appuyant sur une loi qu’on avait promis d’abroger.
U||La tâche que le pays doit entreprendre immédiatement est de sauver de la paralysie la liberté de parole, la liberté d’association et la liberté de la presse.....
U||Dans les circonstances actuelles, le pays n’a d’autre parti que d’adopter une méthode non-violente afin obtenir satisfaction.... Si la politique du gouvernement était restée neutre, s’il avait laissé à l’opinion publique la possibilité de se développer et de produire tout son effet, il eût été possible de remettre la Désobéissance Civile jusqu’à ce que le Congrès ait acquis un contrôle effectif des forces de violence et obtenu des millions d’adhérents une discipline plus grande. Mais cette répression illégale (en quelque sorte sans parallèle dans l’histoire de notre malheureux pays) nous a fait un devoir impératif d’adopter immédiatement la Désobéissance Civile en masse. Le Comité 333 d’Action du Congrès l’a limitée à quelques régions, que je dois fixer de temps à autre, et qui pour l’instant sont restreintes à Bardoli. Cette autorité me permettrait de donner immédiatement mon consentement à un groupe de cent villages de Guntur dans la présidence de M
U||adras, s’ils sont capables de se conformer strictement aux conditions de non-violence, d’union des différentes classes, de manufacture de khadi et de son emploi, et de l’intouchabilité.
U||Je voudrais, avant que le peuple de Bardoli commençât véritablement la Désobéissance Civile, insister respectueusement auprès de vous pour vous prier comme chef du gouvernement de l’Inde de considérer à nouveau votre politique, de rendre la liberté à tous les Non-Coopérateurs condamnés ou en jugement pour leur activité non violente, et d’exprimer en termes précis une politique de non-intervention dans les activités non-violentes du pays entreprises pour faire rendre justice au Califat ou au Pendjab, ou pour le Swaraj, ou pour toute autre question, même au cas où celles-ci sont passibles de répression, d’après certains articles du Code pénal criminel ou de toute autre loi, à condition bien entendu que la Non-violence soit maintenue.
U||Je voudrais aussi vous demander avec insistance de libérer la Presse de tout contrôle administratif et de rembourser toutes les amendes récemment imposées. En vous adressant ces diverses prières, je demande simplement à votre Excellence de faire ce qui se fait dans tous les pays qui prétendent avoir à leur tête un gouvernement civilisé. S’il vous était possible de faire la déclaration nécessaire dans les huit jours qui suivront la publication de ce manifeste, je pourrais 334 conseiller de remettre la Désobéissance Civile jusqu’à ce que les Non-coopérateurs sortis de prison aient eu le temps de considérer à nouveau la question. Si le Gouvernement fait la déclaration demandée, j’y verrai une preuve de son désir sincère de céder devant l’opinion publique. Je n’aurai alors aucune hésitation à conseiller au pays de continuer, sans contrainte violente d’un côté ou de l’autre, à former l’opinion publique, m’en rapportant à celle-ci pour obtenir satisfaction aux demand
U||es qui ont été exprimées et qui ne peuvent changer.
U||La Désobéissance Civile agressive n’aurait lieu dans ce cas que si le gouvernement s’écartait de sa politique de neutralité absolue, ou s’il refusait de plier devant l’opinion nettement exprimée par la grande majorité du peuple de l’Inde.
U||Croyez-moi
U||Le serviteur et l’ami dévoué
U||de Votre Excellence
U||M. K. Gandhi.

U||LA SEULE SOLUTION POSSIBLE
U||Ce n’est pas sans avoir beaucoup réfléchi et prié que j’ai écrit ma lettre à son Excellence le Vice-Roi. Cette lettre n’est pas une menace, chaque mot dit 335 exactement ce qu’il veut dire. J’ai supplié du fond du cœur le tyran de renoncer au mal. Le tyran, ce n’est pas Lord Reading, mais le système qu’il représente et dont il n’est lui-même que l’impuissante et inconsciente victime. Mais tout système ne fait qu’un avec la personne qui le représente. Aujourd’hui, c’est Lord Reading qui le personnifie, quelque inconscient qu’il soit. Je l’ai prié en toute humilité de considérer la position et de se demander si un mépris officiel des lois peut se justifier d’une façon quelconque. Qu’il jette les yeux sur le compte rendu de la semaine. Tout y est strictement vrai, à moins que les témoins ne soient tous des menteurs. De pareilles choses devraient-elles être possibles?
U||Mais dira-t-on, que faites-vous du mépris de l’autorité? Eh bien, le mépris de l’autorité (non-violent en tout cas) devrait-il justifier un abus barbare et malfaisant de cette même autorité?
U||Si le Vice-Roi ne voit pas ou ne veut pas voir la simplicité incroyable de la solution, l’Inde doit-elle ne rien faire? Il faut que la Désobéissance civile défensive continue à tout prix. Et si l’Inde entière déclarait que les réunions même paisibles ne peuvent avoir lieu sans autorisation, que les enrôlements des volontaires ne peuvent avoir lieu sans autorisation, et que les journaux ne peuvent paraître sans autorisation, cette prohibition serait inadmissible. On ne peut obliger un homme à demander à un autre la permission de respirer, de boire et de manger. Les trois choses que j’ai nommées sont l’air, la boisson et l’aliment nécessaires à l’activité publique.

U||TROP SACRÉ POUR ÊTRE PUBLIÉ
U||Il est certaines choses que l’on préfère ne pas voir publiées non parce qu’elles sont secrètes mais parce qu’elles ont un caractère trop sacré. Parfois la version imprimée produit une impression absolument différente de la parole, bien que le reportage en soit strictement exact. Quand je dis à un enfant en plaisantant, ou en fronçant les sourcils, qu’il est un démon, il ne serait pas juste de dire que j’ai appelé quelqu’un démon sans fournir de longues explications donnant les causes et les raisons. Un mauvais service de ce genre m’a été rendu par un reporter animé, je crois, des meilleures intentions à mon égard, dans le compte rendu d’une conversation que j’ai eue et d’un discours que j’ai fait à l’Ashram du Satyagraha et qui a été publié dans la Chronique de Bombay du 2 courant. Il m’est désagréable que l’on fasse de la publicité à des choses de ce genre. Une conversation rapide est pleine d’allusions à demi mot; et à moins d’y ajouter d’abonda
U||ntes notes il est impossible de la rapporter exactement. On me fait dire, par exemple, que Shantiniketan est pour le progrès matériel, et que Satyagraha Ashram existe uniquement pour le progrès spirituel. Lorsque le Poète lira ceci ou bien il en rira en se rappelant 337 que je suis incapable de dire ou de vouloir laisser entendre une chose pareille de Shantiniketan, ou bien il sera irrité et découragé à la pensée que je manque de sens artistique et d’intelligence au point de ne pas voir ce qu’il y a de spirituel à Shantiniketan. Le Poète, j’en suis persuadé, ne me fera pas l’injure de me juger capable de penser ce qui m’est attribué. Je pourrais dire au poète, comme je l’ai fait d’ailleurs, que Shantiniketan manque de discipline. Il en a ri, a même assumé la responsabilité de ce qui faisait l’objet de ma critique et l’a défendu en disant qu’il était poète et que Shantiniketan était sa distraction, qu’il ne savait que chanter et faire chanter les autres; je pourrais,
U|| moi, y introduire toute la discipline que je voudrais; mais lui n’était pas autre chose qu’un poète. Le lecteur doit savoir que j’ai fait plusieurs séjours au Shantiniketan. J’ai la permission de le considérer comme une retraite et comme une demeure. Mes fils y ont vécu lorsque j’étais en Europe, ainsi qu’à Gurukula. Ma conversation avec le professeur hindou venait de notre commune affection pour Shantiniketan. Comment Shantiniketan pourrait-il être autrement que spirituel lorsque l’auteur de la poésie purement spirituelle y est l’esprit qui domine. Je ne suis pas assez stupide pour supposer qu’un endroit où vit Debendranath Tagore puisse manquer de spiritualité. Les lecteurs de la Jeune Inde savent que de temps en temps j’ai reçu de Shantiniketan un breuvage spirituel que m’envoyait Barodada[91] qui veille incessamment sur moi et prie 338 pour le succès de ma mission. Je m’empresse de dire au lecteur que je considère un grand nombre de professeurs et de maîtres de Sha
U||ntiniketan comme des hommes d’une haute spiritualité et d’une grande noblesse et que c’est pour moi un privilège de les connaître. Je dois ajouter pour plus ample information que je considère la province du Bengale comme la plus spirituelle de toutes. La conversation si malencontreusement reproduite avait eu lieu sur un ton de plaisanterie. J’ai souvent déclaré à ceux qui aiment Shantiniketan que la spiritualité était plus grande à l’Ashram qu’à Shantiniketan; mais dans cette rivalité il ne faut pas voir une prétention de supériorité. Je désire ardemment que l’Ashram reste caché aux yeux du public. Nous y sommes un groupe de travailleurs pour la cause, humbles et peu savants, qui connaissons nos faiblesses et essayons de les comprendre encore davantage. Nous cherchons avec ardeur à découvrir la vérité et désirons vivre et mourir pour elle. On ne devrait jamais essayer de comparer deux institutions analogues, mais non identiques. S’il fallait comparer cependant, je dirais
U|| que, malgré la discipline de l’Ashram et son lever matinal, je voterais avec sincérité pour Shantiniketan, parce qu’il est le frère aîné, bien plus avancé en âge et, je le sais, en sagesse également. Il y a un «mais» cependant; il faut que les habitants de Shantiniketan prennent garde à l’avance de la petite retraite du Gujerat ailleurs.....

U||LE CRIME DE CHAURI-CHAURA
U||Dieu a été d’une bonté excessive pour moi. Il vient de m’avertir pour la troisième fois que dans l’Inde ne règne pas encore cette atmosphère de Vérité et de Non-Violence qui peut seule justifier la Désobéissance civile en masse, celle qui peut être vraiment nommée civile, c’est-à-dire douce, humble, sage, volontaire et cependant aimante, jamais criminelle ou haïssable.
U||Il m’avertit en 1919, lorsque commença l’agitation soulevée par la loi Rowlatt. Ahmedabad, Virangham et Kheda ont erré. Amritsar et Kasur ont erré. Je suis revenu sur mes pas, j’avais fait une erreur de calcul aussi énorme que l’Himalaya. Je me suis humilié devant Dieu et devant les hommes, et non seulement j’ai suspendu la Désobéissance civile en masse, mais j’ai suspendu la mienne qui devait être, je le sais, civile et non-violente.
U||Dieu m’avertit ensuite d’une façon terrible. Il me rendit le témoin oculaire des actes accomplis par la populace le 17 novembre à Bombay. Elle agissait dans l’intérêt de la Non-coopération. J’annonçai mon intention de suspendre la désobéissance civile en masse qui devait commencer immédiatement à Bardoli. L’humiliation que j’éprouvai fut plus grande 340 encore qu’en 1919, mais elle me fit du bien. Je suis persuadé que la Nation y gagna. Par cette suspension, l’Inde montra qu’elle était pour la Vérité et la Non-Violence.
U||Mais l’humiliation la plus amère que je dusse ressentir était encore à venir. Madras m’avait prévenu, mais je n’en avais pas tenu compte. Dieu me parla clairement par Chauri-Chaura. Il y eut, si je ne me trompe, ample provocation de la part des agents de la police qui furent si brutalement mis en pièces. Ils n’avaient pas tenu compte de l’assurance donnée par l’inspecteur que le peuple ne serait pas molesté, et lorsque la procession fut passée insultèrent et inquiétèrent les retardataires isolés. Ceux-ci appelèrent à l’aide. La foule revint. La police fit feu, puis ayant épuisé le peu de munitions qu’elle possédait se réfugia dans le Thana (commissariat). La foule, me dit alors mon informateur, mit le feu au thana où les agents s’étaient emprisonnés eux-mêmes. Ils voulurent s’enfuir pour échapper à la mort, furent massacrés, et leurs restes déchiquetés furent lancés dans la flamme dévorante.
U||Aucun volontaire non-coopérateur n’a pris part à la brutalité commise. Non seulement la foule avait été provoquée, mais elle connaissait par expérience la tyrannie arbitraire de la police de ce district. Aucune provocation ne saurait pourtant justifier le meurtre brutal d’hommes qui étaient devenus sans défense et s’étaient remis virtuellement à la merci de la foule. Et alors que l’Inde prétend être non-violente et espère monter par ses méthodes non-violentes sur le trône de la liberté, la violence de la foule, même occasionnée par une sérieuse provocation, 341 est d’un bien triste augure. Supposez que Dieu ait permis à la Désobéissance Civile de Bardoli de réussir, le Gouvernement eût abdiqué en faveur des vainqueurs de Bardoli, et qui donc eût maîtrisé cet élément déréglé capable de commettre des actions inhumaines lorsqu’on le provoque? Pour arriver par la Non-violence à un gouvernement indépendant, il faut la maîtrise non-violente des éléments violents d
U||u pays. Les Non-Coopérateurs non-violents ne peuvent réussir que s’ils parviennent à maîtriser les hommes sans aveu de l’Inde, ou en d’autres termes lorsque ces derniers auront appris, soit par religion, soit par patriotisme, à s’abstenir de leurs violences, pendant la campagne de Non-Coopération, tout au moins. La tragédie de Chauri-Chaura fut donc pour nous un réveil absolu.
U||Mais, me murmurait la voix de Satan, ton manifeste au Vice-Roi, ta réponse à sa lettre? Ce fut la coupe d’humiliation la plus amère. «C’est assurément une lâcheté de s’abstenir au lendemain de menaces pompeuses adressées au Gouvernement et de promesses faites au peuple de Bardoli». Satan m’invitait ainsi à renier la Vérité et par conséquent la religion, à renier Dieu lui-même. J’exposai au Comité d’Action et à d’autres de mes camarades qui se trouvaient près de moi mes doutes et mes difficultés. Tous ne furent pas d’accord avec moi au début; il est plus que probable qu’à l’heure actuelle il en est encore qui ne le sont pas. Mais il est rare qu’un homme ait le bonheur de rencontrer autour de lui des collègues et des camarades si pleins d’égards et d’indulgence. Ils comprirent mes difficultés et écoutèrent patiemment mes raisons. Le public connaît 342 les décisions prises par le Comité d’Action. Au point de vue politique, renverser brusquement tout le pr
U||ogramme agressif peut paraître absurde et déraisonnable, mais il n’est point douteux qu’au point de vue religieux c’est un acte logique et je me permets d’assurer à ceux qui n’en sont pas certains que le pays a gagné à mon humiliation et à la confession que j’ai faite de mon erreur.
U||La seule vertu à laquelle je prétende, c’est la Vérité et la Non-Violence. Je ne prétends à aucun pouvoir surhumain. Je possède la même chair corruptible que le plus faible de mes semblables et suis par conséquent aussi porté qu’eux à me tromper. Mes services ont bien des limitations, mais Dieu les a bénis malgré leurs imperfections. La confession des fautes, c’est le coup de balai qui enlève la saleté et laisse la surface plus nette qu’auparavant. Je me sens plus fort de m’être confessé. La cause doit gagner par son recul même. Un homme ne parvient jamais à son but s’il persiste à s’écarter de la bonne route.
U||On a déclaré que Chauri-Chaura ne pouvait avoir d’influence sur Bardoli. Il n’y aurait de danger, assure-t-on, que si Bardoli se laissait influencer par Chauri-Chaura et se trouvait lui-même entraîné à la violence. Et de cela je n’ai pas la moindre crainte. Le peuple de Bardoli est à mon avis le plus pacifique de l’Inde; seulement, Bardoli n’est qu’un point minuscule sur la carte de l’Inde. Ses efforts ne peuvent réussir que s’il a la coopération parfaite des autres parties du territoire. La Désobéissance de Bardoli ne sera civile que si les autres régions de l’Inde demeurent non-violentes. De même qu’il suffit d’un grain d’arsenic pour empoisonner une jarre de lait 343 et le rendre impropre à la consommation, le poison mortel de Chauri-Chaura suffit à rendre inacceptable l’attitude civile même de Bardoli.
U||Cette tragédie est, après tout, le symptôme d’un mal qui s’aggrave. Je n’ai jamais supposé que là où il y avait répression il y eût absence totale de violence mentale ou physique. Seulement j’avais cru, comme je le crois toujours et les pages de la Jeune Inde le prouvent abondamment, que dans les endroits où elle a lieu, la répression n’est pas proportionnée au peu d’importance de la violence populaire... La Désobéissance civile ne doit comporter aucune excitation. Elle est une préparation à la souffrance muette. Son effet est merveilleux, quoique imperceptible et doux... La tragédie de Chauri-Chaura est réellement le poteau indicateur sur notre route qui nous montre le chemin dangereux dans lequel l’Inde pourrait s’engager, si de sérieuses précautions n’étaient pas prises. Si nous ne voulons pas que la violence naisse de la non-violence, il est évident qu’il nous faut revenir rapidement sur nos pas, rétablir une atmosphère de calme, réorganiser notre programme et 
U||ne pas songer à commencer la Désobéissance Civile en masse, avant d’être certains que la paix sera maintenue en dépit de toutes les provocations du gouvernement. Il faut que nous soyons assurés qu’aucune partie du pays ne commencera sans autorisation la Désobéissance Civile en masse.
U||L’organisation du Congrès est loin d’être parfaite et ses instructions sont exécutées avec négligence. Nous n’avons pas organisé de Comités dans chaque village; et là où nous l’avons fait, ils ne se conforment pas toujours à nos instructions. Nous n’avons 344 guère plus de dix millions d’adhérents sur nos listes, nous sommes au 15 février, et beaucoup n’ont pas encore payé leurs quatre annas de souscription pour l’année courante. L’enrôlement des volontaires se fait avec indifférence. Ils ne remplissent pas toutes les conditions de leur engagement. Ils ne portent même pas de khaddar tissé et filé à la main. Tous les volontaires hindous ne se sont pas débarrassés du péché d’intouchabilité, tous ne sont pas exempts de violence. Ce n’est pas leur emprisonnement qui nous donnera le Swaraj, ou qui servira la cause sacrée du Califat, ou qui nous autorisera à refuser de payer des serviteurs infidèles. Certains d’entre nous commettent des fautes sans le faire expr
U||ès, mais il en est qui pèchent volontairement. Ils s’enrôlent comme volontaires, sachant parfaitement qu’ils n’ont pas l’intention de demeurer non-violents et qu’ils ne le demeureront pas. Nous manquons donc de franchise, tout autant que le gouvernement que nous accusons de mensonge. Comment oserions-nous pénétrer dans le royaume de la liberté, en ayant sur les lèvres seulement un hommage à la vérité et à la non-violence?
U||Si nous ne voulons pas reculer davantage, il est indispensable à notre progrès même d’apaiser l’excitation et de suspendre la Désobéissance Civile en masse. J’espère que cette suspension ne désappointera pas ceux et celles qui font partie du Congrès, mais qu’au contraire ils se sentiront allégés du fardeau de la fausseté et du péché national.
U||Que l’adversaire se fasse gloire de notre humiliation et de notre soi-disant défaite! Il vaut mieux qu’on nous accuse de lâcheté et de faiblesse que de 345 renier notre serment et de trahir Dieu. Mieux vaut mille fois paraître manquer de sincérité envers le monde que de manquer de sincérité envers nous-mêmes. En ce qui me concerne personnellement, suspendre la Désobéissance Civile n’est pas une pénitence suffisante pour me punir d’avoir été l’instrument même involontaire de la violence brutale du peuple, à Chauri-Chaura.
U||Je dois subir une purification personnelle, devenir un meilleur instrument plus capable d’enregistrer les moindres variations de l’atmosphère morale qui m’entoure. Mes prières doivent acquérir une sincérité et une humilité plus profondes. Rien n’est pour moi plus purifiant et plus fortifiant qu’un jeûne accompagné de la coopération mentale nécessaire.
U||Je sais que l’attitude mentale est tout. De même qu’une prière peut n’être simplement qu’une intonation machinale comme celle de l’oiseau, un jeûne peut n’être autre chose qu’une torture machinale de la chair. Pour le but que je me propose, un procédé machinal de ce genre n’a aucune valeur. Un chant machinal peut servir à modeler la voix, un jeûne machinal peut purifier le corps. Ni l’un ni l’autre ne toucheront l’âme.
U||Mais le jeûne entrepris pour arriver à une expression de soi plus complète, pour atteindre à la suprématie de l’esprit sur la chair, est un des plus puissants facteurs de notre évolution. Après avoir mûrement réfléchi, je m’impose donc un jeûne de cinq jours consécutifs... C’est le moins que je puisse faire. Je n’ai pas perdu de vue le Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde qui approche. Je sais le chagrin que ces jours de jeûne vont causer à mes nombreux amis, mais 346 je ne puis remettre ma pénitence ni la raccourcir.
U||Je supplie mes collaborateurs de ne pas m’imiter. Ils n’auraient pas mes raisons, ils n’ont pas été les créateurs de la Désobéissance Civile. Je me trouve dans la situation du chirurgien maladroit, il me faut ou abdiquer ou acquérir un talent supérieur. Alors qu’une pénitence personnelle est non seulement nécessaire mais obligatoire pour moi, la maîtrise de soi prescrite par le Comité d’Action est assurément une pénitence suffisante pour tous les autres. Elle n’est point aisée et si elle est sincère peut porter les meilleurs fruits.....
U||Tout jeûne et toute pénitence doivent autant que possible être tenus secrets. Mais mon jeûne étant à la fois une pénitence et un châtiment doivent être publics. C’est une pénitence pour moi et un châtiment pour ceux que j’essaye de servir, pour ceux pour qui j’aime vivre, et pour qui je serais heureux de mourir.
U||Ils ont péché contre les lois du Congrès, bien qu’ils en fussent des partisans sinon des adhérents. Ils massacrèrent probablement les agents avec mon nom sur les lèvres. La seule façon de châtier lorsqu’on aime est de souffrir. Je ne peux souhaiter qu’on les arrête, mais je tiens à ce qu’ils sachent que je souffrirai parce qu’ils ont péché contre la doctrine du Congrès. Je conseille à ceux qui se sentent coupables et qui se repentent de se livrer au gouvernement et d’avouer leur faute afin d’en subir le châtiment... Que les meurtriers acceptent ou non mon conseil, je tiens à ce qu’ils sachent qu’ils ont sérieusement compromis les opérations du Swaraj, et qu’en faisant ajourner le mouvement de Bardoli ils ont nui à la cause 347 même qu’ils voulaient probablement servir... Je suis prêt à souffrir n’importe quelle humiliation, n’importe quelle torture, un ostracisme absolu et la mort même, pour empêcher ce mouvement de devenir violence ou précurseur de violence

U||16 février 1922
U||COMITÉ DU CONGRÈS DE TOUTE L’INDE
U||La session du Comité de Toute l’Inde qui vient d’avoir lieu a été à certains égards plus remarquable que le Congrès. Il y a tant de courants cachés, de violence consciente et inconsciente, que j’ai prié véritablement et littéralement pour une défaite désastreuse. J’ai toujours fait partie d’une minorité. Le lecteur ignore que dans l’Afrique du Sud j’ai débuté avec l’unanimité presque complète et suis descendu à une minorité de 64 et même de 16, puis je suis remonté à une énorme majorité. Le travail le plus important et le meilleur a été fait dans le désert de la minorité.
U||Je sais que le Gouvernement craint plus que tout cette énorme majorité que j’ai l’air de dominer. Il ignore que je la crains autant que lui. Je suis véritablement 348 écœuré de cette adoration de la multitude qui ne réfléchit pas. Je serais plus sûr du terrain si elle crachait sur moi. Je ne serais pas obligé de confesser mes erreurs gigantesques et autres, ni forcé de reculer ni de réorganiser.
U||Mais cela ne devait pas être.
U||Un ami m’a mis en garde contre le danger d’exploiter ma dictature. Il ignorait que jamais je ne m’en suis servi, ne fût-ce que pour la seule raison que l’occasion ne s’en est pas encore présentée. La «Dictature» me servira seulement lorsque le gouvernement aura empêché les rouages du Congrès de fonctionner.
U||Loin d’avoir exploité ma dictature, je me demande si je ne me laisse pas moi-même exploiter. J’avoue que j’en ai la terreur. Ma propre sécurité consiste dans mon impudence. J’ai prévenu mes amis du Comité que je suis incorrigible. Chaque fois que le peuple commettra des erreurs, je continuerai à les confesser. Le seul tyran que j’accepte ici-bas, c’est «la petite voix silencieuse». Et même si je devais envisager la minorité d’un seul, j’aurais je crois le courage d’être cette minorité désespérée. Voilà la seule position vraie pour moi. Mais aujourd’hui, je suis devenu plus triste et, je l’espère, plus sage. Je me rends compte que notre Non-Violence est à fleur de peau. Nous brûlons d’indignation. Le gouvernement entretient le feu par ses actes insensés. Il semblerait presque qu’il désire voir ce pays couvert de meurtres, de pillages, de rapines, afin de pouvoir prétendre que lui seul est capable d’y mettre fin.
U||Cette Non-Violence me semble due uniquement à notre impuissance. Il semble presque que nous nourrissions 349 le désir de nous venger à la première occasion.
U||Est-ce qu’une Non-Violence volontaire peut naître de ce qui me paraît la Non-Violence forcée des faibles? Est-ce que je ne tente pas une expérience vaine? Qu’arrivera-t-il, le jour où éclatera la fureur, si personne, homme, femme, ou enfant n’est en sécurité et si la main de chacun est levée contre son prochain? A quoi servira-t-il que je jeûne à en mourir, si une telle catastrophe doit se produire? Y a-t-il une alternative? Ne rien faire, prétendre que ce que je sais être mal est bien? Dire qu’une coopération sincère naîtra d’une coopération fausse et forcée, cela revient à dire que la lumière naîtra des ténèbres.
U||Coopérer avec le gouvernement est tout autant une faiblesse et une faute qu’une alliance avec la violence en suspens. La difficulté est presque insurmontable. Aussi, avec le sentiment croissant que cette Non-Violence est superficielle je ne puis faire autrement que me tromper sans cesse et revenir en arrière comme un homme qui s’avance dans une forêt vierge et toujours doit s’arrêter, revenir sur ses pas, qui trébuche, se blesse et saigne.
U||Je m’attendais à une certaine somme d’abattement, de désappointement et de ressentiment; mais je n’étais nullement préparé à une violente tempête d’opposition. Il me parut évident que les travailleurs pour la cause n’étaient point d’humeur à entreprendre un travail constructif solide. Le programme n’avait rien de séduisant. Ils ne restaient point associés pour des réformes sociales. Ils ne pouvaient arracher le pouvoir au gouvernement par un travail de réforme aussi routinier. Ils voulaient frapper des 350 coups «non-violents»! Que tout ceci semblait manquer de réalité! Ils ne voulaient pas se donner la peine de réfléchir que, même s’ils parvenaient à vaincre le Gouvernement par un étalage enfantin de fureur, il leur serait impossible de gouverner le pays, une seule journée, sans organisation et méthode constructives, sérieuses et laborieuses.
U||Il ne faut pas, ainsi qu’eût dit Mohamed Ali, se faire emprisonner «pour une fausse raison». N’importe quel emprisonnement ne nous donnera pas le Swaraj. N’importe quelle désobéissance n’allumera pas en nous l’esprit d’obéissance et de discipline. Les prisons pour le criminel endurci ne sont pas la porte qui mène à la liberté. Elles ne sont un temple de liberté que pour ceux qui personnifient l’innocence. L’exécution de Socrate fit, pour nous, de l’immortalité une réalité vivante; il n’en est pas de même de l’exécution d’innombrables criminels. Rien ne nous porte à croire que nous pourrons dérober le Swaraj par l’emprisonnement de milliers d’hommes qui se prétendront non-violents, mais dans le cœur desquels bouillonnera la haine, le mauvais vouloir et la violence.
U||Ce serait tout différent si nous nous battions avec des armes, si nous donnions des coups et si nous en recevions. Mais ce n’est pas notre lutte actuelle. Soyons sincères, si nous voulons obtenir le Swaraj par la force, abandonnons la Non-Violence et employons toute la force dont nous sommes capables! Ce serait une attitude raisonnable, vraie et franche à laquelle le monde est habitué depuis des siècles. Nul ne pourrait alors proférer contre nous cette horrible accusation d’hypocrisie.
U||351
U||Mais la majorité ne veut pas m’écouter. Malgré tous mes avertissements et mes pressantes objurgations de rejeter la résolution si elle ne croyait pas la non-violence indispensable pour atteindre notre but, elle l’a adoptée sans y rien changer. Je lui demanderai donc de reconnaître sa part de responsabilité. Elle est tenue maintenant à ne pas se précipiter dans la Désobéissance Civile et à faire d’abord œuvre constructive. Je la supplierai de ne pas prêter l’oreille aux clameurs de ceux qui veulent une action immédiate. L’action immédiate ne consiste pas à se faire emprisonner, ni même à s’efforcer d’obtenir la liberté de parole, de presse et d’association, mais à se purifier soi-même, à s’interroger et à s’organiser tranquillement. Si nous ne prenons pas garde, nous courons le risque de nous noyer dans un fleuve dont nous ignorons la profondeur.
U||Il est inutile de songer aux prisonniers. En apprenant ce qui s’était passé à Chauri-Chaura, je les ai sacrifiés comme première pénitence. Ils sont allés en prison, pour que la force du peuple leur rende la liberté. On espérait que le premier acte du Parlement du Swaraj serait d’ouvrir la porte des prisons. Dieu en avait décidé autrement. Nous qui sommes restés libres, avons essayé sans y parvenir. Les prisonniers ont tout intérêt à présent à y rester jusqu’à la fin de leur peine. Ceux qui y sont entrés sous de faux prétextes, par suite de quelque erreur ou parce qu’ils comprenaient mal le mouvement, pourront en sortir en faisant des excuses, ou en adressant des pétitions. Le mouvement n’en sera que plus fort, d’avoir été épuré. Les cœurs les plus solides se réjouiront de l’occasion inattendue de souffrir 352 davantage. Depuis des années, des milliers de Russes «pourrissent» dans les prisons de la Russie et cependant le malheureux peuple n’est pas encore libre. 
U||La liberté est une coquette des plus difficiles à conquérir et à satisfaire. Nous avons montré que nous savions souffrir, mais nous n’avons pas encore souffert suffisamment. Si le peuple en général demeure passivement non-violent, et si quelques-uns sont non-violents, d’intention, de parole et d’action, activement, sincèrement et en connaissance de cause, nous atteindrons le but dans le plus bref délai et avec le moins de souffrances possibles. Si nous envoyons en prison des hommes qui entretiennent dans leur cœur des sentiments de violence, nous remettons indéfiniment le résultat que nous avons en vue.
U||Le devoir de ceux qui font partie de la majorité est donc, dans leurs sphères respectives, d’affronter les sarcasmes, les insultes, de voir, s’il le faut diminuer leurs rangs, mais de poursuivre leur but avec détermination, sans dévier d’une ligne. Les autorités, prenant la suspension de notre mouvement pour de la faiblesse, auront peut-être recours à une répression plus grande encore. Nous devons la supporter, nous devons même abandonner la Désobéissance Civile défensive et concentrer toute notre énergie sur la réforme économique et sociale, insipide mais fortifiante. Nous devons plier les genoux et assurer aux Modérés qu’ils n’ont rien à craindre de nous. Nous devons donner aux Zamindars l’assurance que nous n’avons contre eux aucun sentiment hostile.
U||L’Anglais est généralement hautain; il ne nous comprend pas; il se considère un être supérieur. Il se 353 croit au monde pour nous faire obéir. Il compte sur ses canons et sur ses forts pour se protéger. Il nous méprise. Il veut nous forcer à coopérer avec lui, c’est-à-dire à être ses esclaves. Il faut le vaincre lui aussi, non en pliant le genou devant lui, mais en nous tenant à distance, sans le haïr cependant et sans lui faire de mal. Le molester serait lâche. Si nous refusons tout simplement de nous considérer comme ses esclaves et de lui rendre hommage, nous aurons fait notre devoir. Une souris ne peut qu’éviter le chat. Elle ne peut négocier avec lui, tant qu’il n’a pas limé ses griffes et ses dents. Mais en même temps, nous devons montrer tout notre respect aux quelques Anglais qui cherchent à se guérir et à guérir leurs compatriotes de la maladie de l’orgueil de race.
U||La minorité a des idéaux différents. Elle ne croit pas au programme. Ne serait-il pas logique et patriotique de sa part de former un nouveau parti et une organisation nouvelle? Elle pourrait alors instruire vraiment le pays. Ceux qui ne croient pas à la doctrine du Congrès doivent assurément le quitter. Il faut que même une organisation nationale ait une croyance. Quelqu’un qui ne croirait pas au Swaraj, par exemple, n’est pas à sa place au Congrès. Je prétends également que celui qui ne croit pas aux «moyens pacifiques et légitimes» n’y est pas davantage. Un membre du Congrès peut ne pas croire à la Non-Coopération et y demeurer cependant, mais il ne peut conserver son titre de membre du Congrès, s’il croit à la violence et au mensonge. J’ai donc été profondément blessé de l’opposition qui fut faite à ma proposition au sujet de la croyance, et à ma paraphrase 354 des deux adjectifs «pacifiques et légitimes» que j’avais expliqués par «non-violents et sincères» re
U||spectivement. J’avais mes raisons pour cette paraphrase. Afin d’éviter une discussion pénible, j’ai accepté de la supprimer, mais j’ai eu l’impression que la vérité recevait un coup mortel.
U||Je suis persuadé que ceux qui ont soulevé l’objection sont d’aussi bons patriotes que je crois l’être, ils désirent aussi ardemment le Swaraj que tout autre membre du Congrès. Seulement, je considère que l’esprit patriotique demande qu’ils adhèrent strictement et loyalement à la Non-Violence et à la Vérité; et s’ils n’y croient pas, ils doivent cesser d’appartenir au Congrès.
U||N’y a-t-il point une saine économie pour la nation à ce que tous les idéaux soient bien définis et à travailler indépendamment les uns des autres? le parti le plus populaire remportera la victoire. Si nous voulons développer le véritable esprit démocratique, ce n’est pas par l’obstruction que nous y parviendrons, mais par l’abstention.
U||Cette session du Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde a démontré fortement que c’est nous qui retardons les progrès du Swaraj, et non pas le gouvernement. Chaque faute du gouvernement aide notre cause. Chaque négligence de notre part lui fait tort.

U||SI L’ON M’ARRÊTE
U||Le bruit court à nouveau que mon arrestation est imminente. Quelques fonctionnaires prétendent, paraît-il, que ce fut une erreur de ne pas m’arrêter à l’époque où on l’avait décidé, c’est-à-dire le 11 ou 12 février, et que la décision prise au sujet de Bardoli n’aurait pas dû influencer le programme du gouvernement. On rapporte également que le gouvernement ne peut vaincre l’agitation croissante qui réclame à Londres mon arrestation et ma déportation. Je ne vois pas moi-même comment le gouvernement pourrait faire autrement que de m’arrêter, s’il veut que la Désobéissance Civile individuelle ou en masse cesse complètement.
U|| 
U|| 
U||Dans ce cas, il ne faut pas qu’il y ait de Hartal, de démonstrations bruyantes ou de processions. Je considérerais un calme parfait comme une haute marque d’estime de la part de mes compatriotes. Ce qui me ferait grand plaisir par exemple, ce serait de voir l’œuvre constructive du Congrès se poursuivre avec la régularité d’une horloge et la rapidité de l’express du Pendjab. J’aimerais que ceux qui jusqu’à présent ne l’ont point fait, renoncent volontairement 356 à leurs tissus étrangers et en fassent un feu de joie. Qu’ils remplissent tout le programme constructif élaboré à Bardoli, et non seulement ils obtiendront ma liberté et celle d’autres prisonniers, mais ils inaugureront le Swaraj et assureront la réparation des injustices faites au Califat et au Pendjab. Qu’ils se souviennent que les quatre piliers fondamentaux du Swaraj sont: la Non-Violence, l’Union Hindoue-Musulmane-Sikh-Parsi-Chrétienne-Israélite, la suppression totale de l’Intouchabilité, et la fabric
U||ation du khaddar filé et tissé à la main pour supplanter complètement le tissu étranger.
U||J’ai idée que ce ne serait pas un mal pour le peuple si on m’enlevait à lui. Tout d’abord la superstition que je suis doué d’un pouvoir surnaturel s’effondrerait; l’erreur de croire que mon influence seule a fait accepter le programme de Non-Coopération serait démontrée; en poursuivant notre activité malgré le départ d’un des auteurs du programme nous prouverions que nous sommes capables d’avoir le Swaraj. Enfin, et égoïstement, cette circonstance me procurerait un peu de calme et de repos physique, que je crois avoir mérités.

U||ARRESTATION DE GANDHI ET CE QUI SUIVIT (résumé)
U||Ce qui était prévu depuis longtemps est arrivé. Le sacrifice ardemment souhaité par Gandhi est consommé. Il se sent libre, à présent que le gouvernement sous lequel il lui était devenu intolérable de vivre l’a mis en prison.
U||Le bruit de son arrestation imminente courut dès le 8. Il partit néanmoins pour Ajmere, sur une invitation pressante de M. Chhotani; et la rumeur circula qu’il se pourrait qu’on l’arrêtât en route.
U||Il revint sain et sauf à l’Ashram le 10 et s’y montra plein d’entrain. Ces bruits furent reçus à l’Ashram avec le plus grand calme. On était habitué à ces sortes de séparations. La routine journalière n’en fut pas troublée. Le soir pourtant, à l’heure de la prière, il se fit un profond silence, tandis que d’un pas rapide et angoissé les habitants de l’Ashram arrivaient pour assister à ce qui serait peut-être pour longtemps la dernière prière de leur Bapu. Il était d’une gaieté inusitée, il joua avec les enfants et rivalisa d’entrain avec eux, il travailla ensuite comme à l’ordinaire et ne cessa de voir des amis qui venaient aux nouvelles. A dix heures il fit ses ablutions et se disposa à aller se reposer. Tous ses amis 358 étaient partis; Banker qui était venu avec M. Shvaib pour confirmer la rumeur s’était éloigné également. Quelques minutes plus tard, M. Shvaib revenait avec Anasuyabai annoncer que M. Banker venait d’être arrêté et qu’on allait proc
U||éder à l’arrestation de Gandhi. La nouvelle s’étant répandue, tous les habitants de l’Ashram: hommes, femmes, enfants accoururent pour recevoir sa bénédiction. Son hymne préféré en Gujerati fut chanté en chœur, puis il eut un mot pour chacun, les encourageant tous par sa joie et son animation et il se disposa à aller lui-même au devant de la police.
U||Maulana Hasrat Mohani qui l’avait quitté à Ahmedabad en revenant d’Ajmere arriva à l’Ashram juste à temps pour le voir avant son arrestation. Ils s’embrassèrent et s’assurèrent de leur mutuelle estime et de leur respect réciproque. Le Maulana était très affecté, il promit à Gandhi de consacrer toute son énergie à la cause de la Non-Coopération et de la Non-Violence.
U||Gandhi et M. Banker furent alors conduits à la prison de Sabarmati, où Madame Gandhi et cinq ou six autres personnes furent autorisées à les accompagner..... Le lendemain, on les conduisit devant le juge d’instruction M. Allan Brown I. C. S. La nouvelle avait été tenue secrète; néanmoins un grand nombre de spectateurs avaient obtenu l’autorisation d’assister à l’interrogatoire. Cinq témoins furent interrogés pour l’accusation, au nom du Gouvernement: M. Healy, Surveillant Général de la Police du District, le greffier du tribunal de Bombay, M. Dinshaw Gharda, M. Chatfield, magistrat d’Ahmedabad, un sous-inspecteur de la police et un détective de la 359 police secrète. Ils eurent à répondre à deux questions. Lecture fut ensuite donnée d’articles de la Jeune Inde afin de prouver qui en était l’auteur et leur but.
U||Plusieurs heures furent perdues sur ces deux questions fort simples, afin de ne pas manquer aux formalités. Il semblait absurde de passer tant de temps sur un fait évident. Il y avait dans toute l’affaire quelque chose de théâtral et d’artificiel: la condescendance du Magistrat même lorsqu’il s’adressait à des amis des collègues ou des supérieurs le respect témoigné au Président du tribunal, quelque soit la personnalité qui en occupe le siège: coutumes traditionnelles peut-être, qui deviennent naturelles à ceux qui les pratiquent, mais qui, bien que revêtues de splendeur, paraissent étranges et déplacées à celui qui les observe pour la première fois.

U||LE GRAND PROCÈS
U||La «Couronne» contre M. K. Gandhi et S. G. Banker.
U||Le Procès de Gandhi et de Banker commença à la Circuit House de Shahi Bag le samedi 18 mars 360 à midi devant M. C. S. Broomsfield juge du District et Sessions d’Ahmedabad.
U||Sir J. T. Strangman et Rao Bahadur Girdharlal dirigeaient l’accusation. Les accusés n’avaient point d’avocat.
U||A midi, le juge ouvrit la séance, en disant qu’une légère erreur dans l’exposé des faits reprochés aux accusés l’obligeait d’abord à rectifier cet exposé. Après quoi le greffier du tribunal donna lecture de l’acte d’accusation, le délit consistant dans la publication de trois articles parus dans la Jeune Inde du 22 Septembre, du 15 décembre 1921 et du 23 février 1922. Lecture fut ensuite donnée des articles en question dans l’ordre suivant: Corruption du Loyalisme; une Enigme et sa Solution; et Secouant la crinière[92].
U||361
U||Le juge expliqua brièvement les raisons de la mise en accusation. Il demanda à Gandhi s’il reconnaissait avoir commis les délits qu’on lui reprochait, ou s’il désirait plaider sa cause. Gandhi déclara qu’il se reconnaissait coupable et ajouta qu’il avait remarqué 362 que le nom du Roi, ainsi qu’il convenait, n’avait pas été mentionné dans l’acte d’accusation.
U||..... Sir Strangman prit alors la parole au nom de la Couronne. Il montra que les articles incriminés n’étaient pas isolés. Ils faisaient partie d’une campagne 363 organisée... Après en avoir lu certains passages pour en démontrer le caractère séditieux, Sir Strangman poursuivit: «L’accusé est un homme qui possède une grande culture et d’après ce qu’il écrit, il est évidemment un chef. Le mal qu’il peut faire est considérable. 364 Sans doute dans ses articles il a insisté sur la Non-Violence comme base de la campagne et de la doctrine. Mais à quoi peut servir de prêcher la Non-violence s’il prêche la désaffection envers le gouvernement ou pousse ouvertement les autres à le renverser? 365 Il semble que Chauri-Chaura, Madras, répondent à cette question. Ce sont des événements dont le tribunal est prié de tenir compte en prononçant la sentence. La Cour devrait considérer ces circonstances qui méritent un châtiment sévère.
U||Quant au second accusé, son offense est moindre, quoique grave. Il s’occupe de la publication et n’écrit pas. L’accusé étant riche, Sir Strangman demande 366 à la Cour de lui imposer une amende importante outre la peine que l’on jugera bon de lui infliger. Il s’appuie sur le paragraphe III de la loi sur la Presse qui traite des amendes, et déclare que 1000 à 10000 roupies sont exigées dans bien des cas.»
U||Le tribunal s’adressa alors à M. Gandhi et lui demanda s’il avait quelque déclaration à faire, se rapportant à la sentence.
U||M. Gandhi répondit qu’en effet il aurait une déclaration à faire. Le Tribunal lui ayant demandé s’il pouvait la remettre par écrit, afin de la joindre au dossier, Gandhi répondit qu’il la remettrait après l’avoir lue.
U||«Avant de lire cette déclaration, dit-il, je tiens à affirmer que j’approuve entièrement les remarques de l’Avocat général au sujet de mon humble personne. Je considère qu’il a été parfaitement juste à mon égard dans toutes les déclarations qu’il a faites; elles sont absolument exactes, et je n’ai pas le moindre désir de cacher à la cour que prêcher la désaffection vis-à-vis du gouvernement est presque devenu une passion chez moi. L’Avocat Général a tout à fait raison également, lorsqu’il dit que j’ai prêché cette désaffection bien avant de m’occuper de la Jeune Inde, et, dans la déclaration que je vais lire, ce sera mon pénible devoir d’admettre devant la Cour que j’ai commencé bien avant l’époque dont a parlé l’Avocat Général. C’est pour moi un devoir extrêmement pénible, mais qu’il me faut remplir, sachant la responsabilité qui pèse sur ma tête et voulant endosser tout le blâme que le savant Avocat m’a jeté, à propos des incidents de C
U||hauri-Chaura et de Madras et de Bombay. Quand j’y réfléchis profondément et que nuit 367 après nuit j’y songe, je ne puis me désassocier des crimes diaboliques de Chauri-Chaura ou des horreurs de Bombay. L’Avocat Général a raison, lorsqu’il dit qu’homme responsable, homme ayant reçu une part raisonnable d’éducation et possédant une bonne part d’expérience, j’aurais dû savoir les conséquences de chacun de mes actes. Je savais que je jouais avec le feu, j’en ai couru le risque. Si j’étais mis en liberté je recommencerais. J’ai senti ce matin que je manquerais à mon devoir, si je ne disais pas ce que je viens de dire.
U||J’ai voulu éviter la violence, je veux éviter la violence. La Non-Violence est le premier article de ma foi et le dernier; mais il m’a fallu choisir.—Je devais ou me soumettre à un système de gouvernement qui faisait selon moi un mal irréparable à mon pays,—ou courir le risque de voir se déchaîner la fureur de mon peuple lorsque je lui dirais la vérité. Je sais que mon peuple a été parfois pris de folie. J’en suis extrêmement affligé, et je suis ici pour me soumettre non à une peine légère, mais au châtiment le plus sévère. Je ne demande pas miséricorde, je ne plaide aucune circonstance atténuante. Je suis ici pour réclamer et pour accepter joyeusement la peine la plus sévère qui puisse être infligée pour ce qui est selon la loi un crime délibéré et ce qui me paraît à moi le premier devoir d’un citoyen. La seule chose que vous puissiez faire, Juge, c’est de démissionner ou de m’infliger la peine la plus sévère, si vous croyez que le système et la loi que vo
U||us administrez est bonne pour le peuple. Je ne compte pas sur ce genre de conversion; mais peut-être lorsque j’aurai lu ma déposition, aurez-vous entrevu ce qui gronde dans ma 368 poitrine, ce qui m’a fait courir le plus grand risque qu’il soit possible à un homme sensé de courir.
U||DÉCLARATION
U||M. Gandhi lut alors une déclaration écrite:
U||«Je dois peut-être au public de l’Inde et au public de l’Angleterre à qui ce procès a pour but de donner satisfaction, de leur faire connaître pourquoi, de loyaliste et de coopérateur fervent, je suis devenu désaffectionné et Non-coopérateur intransigeant. Je devrais dire également à la Cour pourquoi je me reconnais coupable d’avoir encouragé la désaffection envers un Gouvernement établi dans l’Inde par la loi.
U||Mon activité publique commença en 1893 dans l’Afrique du Sud, à un moment critique. Les premiers rapports que j’eus avec les autorités britanniques de ce pays ne furent point agréables. Je découvris que je n’avais comme homme et comme Indien aucun droit; ou plus exactement je découvris que je n’avais aucun droit, parce que j’étais Indien.
U||Cela ne me dérouta point. Je me dis que cette façon de traiter les Indiens était une excroissance d’un système de gouvernement bon en soi. Je lui donnai donc ma coopération loyale et volontaire, le critiquant sans me gêner lorsque je considérais qu’il se trompait, mais sans jamais souhaiter sa destruction.
U||369
U||Aussi lorsqu’en 1899 l’existence de l’Empire fut menacée par la guerre des Boers, je lui offris mes services, je formai un corps de brancardiers volontaires et pris part à divers engagements qui eurent lieu pour sauver Ladysmith. En 1906, à l’époque de la révolte des Zoulous, je formai un corps d’infirmiers et servis jusqu’à la fin de la révolte. Je reçus chaque fois la croix et fus cité à l’ordre du jour. Pour mes services dans l’Afrique du Sud, Lord Hardinge me remit la médaille d’or Kaiser-Hind. Lorsqu’en 1914 la guerre éclata entre l’Angleterre et l’Allemagne, je formai un corps d’ambulanciers volontaires composé des Indiens qui se trouvaient à Londres, étudiants pour la plupart. Son utilité fut reconnue par les autorités. Enfin, lorsqu’en 1918 à la Conférence de la guerre qui eut lieu à Delhi, Lord Chelmsford fit un pressant appel pour l’enrôlement de la jeunesse, je me donnai tant de mal pour former un corps sanitaire à Khedda que je compromis sérieu
U||sement ma santé. Ce corps allait être formé lorsque les hostilités prirent fin. Dans tous ces efforts, j’étais poussé par la conviction que des services de ce genre me permettraient d’obtenir pour mes compatriotes un rang égal à celui des autres parties de l’Empire.
U||Le premier choc me vint sous forme de l’acte Rowlatt, qui est fait pour voler au peuple sa véritable liberté. Je compris qu’il me fallait mener contre cette loi une agitation vigoureuse. Puis, ce furent les horreurs du Pendjab, qui commencèrent par le massacre du Jallianwala Bagh et arrivèrent à leur point culminant, lorsque l’on donna ordre de faire ramper les gens sur le ventre, de les fouetter publiquement, et autres humiliations indescriptibles; je découvris 370 que la promesse faite par le premier Ministre aux Musulmans de l’Inde, au sujet de l’intégrité de la Turquie et des lieux saints de l’Islam ne serait point tenue. Et malgré ces présages, malgré les conseils de mes amis qui m’avaient mis en garde au Congrès d’Amritsar en 1919, je soutins la Coopération et l’application des Réformes Montague-Chelmsford, parce que j’espérais que le Premier Ministre tiendrait sa promesse aux Musulmans, que l’on panserait la blessure faite au Pendjab, et que les Réformes, si peu a
U||déquates et satisfaisantes qu’elles fussent, seraient le début d’une ère d’espérance pour l’Inde.
U||Mais tout l’espoir que j’avais nourri s’effondra; la promesse faite au Califat ne fut pas tenue, le crime commis au Pendjab fut blanchi, et la plupart des coupables non seulement ne furent pas punis, mais restèrent au service du Gouvernement et continuèrent à émarger au Budget de l’Inde, certains même obtenant de l’avancement. Je me rendis compte également que les Réformes n’indiquaient pas le début d’une transformation dans les sentiments du Gouvernement à notre égard, mais une méthode pour épuiser l’Inde et lui prendre toutes ses richesses et pour prolonger sa servitude.
U||J’en arrivai à contre-cœur à la conclusion que notre association avec la Grande-Bretagne avait, au point de vue politique et économique, rendu l’Inde plus impuissante que jamais. Une Inde désarmée est incapable de pouvoir se défendre contre un agresseur si elle voulait se battre avec lui. C’est au point que certains de nos hommes les plus capables considèrent qu’il faudra à l’Inde plusieurs générations, avant de pouvoir devenir un Dominion. Elle est si 371 pauvre qu’elle ne peut guère résister aux famines. Avant la venue des Anglais, l’Inde tissait et filait suffisamment dans ses millions de chaumières, pour ajouter aux maigres ressources de l’agriculture ce qui lui était nécessaire. Cette industrie villageoise si vitale pour l’existence de l’Inde fut ruinée par des procédés inhumains et cruels décrits par des Anglais qui en ont été témoins. Les habitants des villes ne savent guère comment les masses de l’Inde à demi mourantes de faim tombent dans l’épuisemen
U||t, ils ne savent guère que leur méprisable confort provient du courtage qu’ils reçoivent de l’exploiteur étranger et que ce courtage et ces bénéfices, on l’a arraché aux masses. Ils ne se rendent pas compte que le Gouvernement établi par la loi dans l’Inde n’existe que pour cette exploitation de la masse. Nul sophisme, nul arrangement de chiffres, ne peut faire disparaître le témoignage évident des squelettes que l’on voit dans un grand nombre de villages. En tout cas, je suis certain que l’Angleterre et les habitants des villes de l’Inde, s’il y a un Dieu au-dessus de nous, auront à répondre devant lui de ce crime envers l’humanité et envers l’histoire. Même la Loi dans ce pays est mise au service de l’exploiteur étranger. Mon étude impartiale des procès jugés par la Loi Martiale du Pendjab m’a convaincu que 95 pour 100 des condamnations n’auraient pas dû avoir lieu; l’expérience que j’ai des procès politiques m’a amené à cette conclusion que neuf su
U||r dix des hommes condamnés étaient absolument innocents. Leur crime, c’était d’aimer leur pays. Dans 99 cas sur 100 dans les tribunaux de l’Inde, justice n’est pas rendue aux Indiens, alors qu’elle l’est aux Anglais. Je n’exagère 372 pas. C’est l’expérience de tout Indien ayant eu quelques rapports avec ce genre de cause. Selon moi, l’administration de la loi, consciemment ou inconsciemment, s’est prostituée au service de l’exploiteur.
U||Le plus grand malheur, c’est que les Anglais et leurs associés Indiens qui administrent le pays ignorent qu’ils commettent le crime dont je viens de parler. J’en ai la conviction, nombre de fonctionnaires Anglais dans l’Inde croient de bonne foi que le Gouvernement qu’ils représentent est un des meilleurs qui existent et que l’Inde progresse sûrement, si elle progresse lentement. Ils ignorent qu’un système subtil, mais efficace de terrorisme et un déploiement organisé de forces d’une part, et la privation de tout moyen de défense d’autre part ont émasculé le peuple et l’ont conduit à la dissimulation. Cette habitude épouvantable a contribué à l’ignorance et à l’illusion des administrateurs. Le paragraphe 124 du Code Pénal d’après lequel j’ai le bonheur d’être accusé est au premier rang de ceux qui tendent à supprimer la liberté du citoyen. La loi ne peut donner ou régler l’affection. Si l’on n’a pas d’affection pour un homme ou pour un système, on d
U||oit être libre d’exprimer sa désaffection dans toute sa force, du moment qu’on n’a pas l’intention de se montrer violent ou d’inciter à la violence. Mais d’après le paragraphe sur lequel vous vous appuyez pour nous poursuivre, M. Banker et moi, le seul fait d’exprimer désaffection est un crime. J’ai étudié certaines causes qui ont été jugées d’après ce même paragraphe, et je sais qu’il a fait condamner quelques-uns des Indiens les plus populaires de l’Inde. Je considère 373 par conséquent comme un privilège d’être accusé de même. J’ai essayé d’exprimer le plus brièvement possible les raisons de ma désaffection. Je n’ai aucun grief personnel contre un seul administrateur, j’ai donc encore moins de désaffection envers la personne du Roi. Mais je considère que c’est une vertu d’avoir de la désaffection pour un Gouvernement qui a fait plus de mal à l’Inde dans l’ensemble que n’importe quel autre système antérieur. L’Inde n’a jamais été au
U||ssi peu virile que depuis qu’elle est gouvernée par l’Angleterre. Avec de tels sentiments, je considère comme un crime d’aimer un pareil système. Et je considère comme un privilège précieux d’avoir pu écrire ce que j’ai écrit dans les divers articles qui me sont reprochés.
U||Je suis d’ailleurs convaincu d’avoir rendu service à l’Inde et à l’Angleterre, en leur montrant comment la Non-Coopération pouvait les faire sortir de l’existence contre nature menée par toutes deux. A mon humble avis, la Non-Coopération avec le mal est un devoir tout autant que la Coopération avec le bien. Seulement, autrefois la Non-Coopération consistait délibérément à user de violence envers celui qui faisait le mal. J’ai voulu montrer à mes compatriotes que la Non-Coopération violente ne faisait qu’augmenter le mal et, le mal ne se maintenant que par la violence, qu’il fallait si nous ne voulions pas encourager le mal, nous abstenir de toute violence. La Non-Violence demande qu’on se soumette volontairement à la peine encourue pour ne pas avoir coopéré avec le mal. Je suis donc ici prêt à me soumettre d’un cœur joyeux au châtiment le plus sévère qui puisse m’être infligé pour ce qui est selon la loi un 374 crime délibéré et qui me paraît à moi le premie
U||r devoir du citoyen. Juge, vous n’avez pas le choix, il vous faut démissionner et cesser ainsi de vous associer au mal si vous considérez que la loi que vous êtes chargé d’administrer est mauvaise et qu’en réalité je suis innocent, ou m’infliger la peine la plus sévère si vous croyez que le système et la loi que vous devez appliquer sont bons pour le peuple et que mon activité par conséquent est pernicieuse pour le bien public.»
U||Banker:—«Je tiens seulement à dire que j’ai eu le privilège d’imprimer les articles incriminés; et que je me reconnais coupable. Je n’ai aucune remarque à faire au sujet de la sentence.»
U||JUGEMENT
U||Voici le texte entier du jugement:
U||«Monsieur Gandhi, vous avez rendu ma tâche aisée, en vous reconnaissant coupable. Néanmoins, ce qui reste à faire, c’est-à-dire la détermination d’une juste sentence, est peut-être la tâche la plus difficile qu’un juge de ce pays ait eue à remplir. La loi n’a pas égard aux individus: pourtant, il m’est impossible d’ignorer que vous faites partie d’une catégorie de personnes différentes de celle que j’ai et que j’aurai probablement à juger. Il est impossible d’ignorer 375 qu’aux yeux de millions de vos compatriotes vous êtes un grand patriote et un grand chef. Même ceux qui ne partagent point vos opinions politiques vous considèrent comme un homme de haut idéal, de vie noble et même sainte. Je n’ai à vous juger que sur un point; mon devoir n’est pas de vous juger ou de vous critiquer pour d’autres, et je ne me le permettrai pas. Mon devoir est de vous juger seulement comme homme sujet de la loi, qui de son propre aveu a désobéi à la loi et commis ce qui est p
U||our tout homme un grave délit envers l’Etat. Je n’oublie pas que vous avez constamment prêché contre la violence, et je suis tout disposé à croire qu’en mainte circonstance vous avez fait beaucoup pour empêcher la violence. Mais si je considère la nature de votre enseignement politique et le tempérament de ceux auxquels il s’adressait, ce qui dépasse ma compréhension c’est que vous ayez pu croire que la violence n’en serait pas l’inévitable conséquence.
U||Il est probablement peu de personnes dans l’Inde qui ne regrettent sincèrement que vous ayez rendu impossible à un gouvernement de vous laisser en liberté. Mais c’est ainsi. J’essaie de mettre en balance ce qui vous est dû et ce qui semble nécessaire aux intérêts du public, et je me propose de vous condamner en m’appuyant sur le précédent d’une cause qui ressemble beaucoup à la vôtre et qui fut jugée d’après le même paragraphe, il y a une douzaine d’années. Je veux dire celle de Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Il fut condamné à six années de prison. Vous ne me jugerez pas déraisonnable, je pense, si je vous classe avec Mr. Tilak, en un mot si je vous condamne à deux années de prison pour chacune des 376 accusations, soit à six années en tout, ainsi que je considère que c’est mon devoir de le faire. Je désire ajouter que si, par suite des événements, il était possible de réduire cette peine, personne n’en sera plus heureux que moi.»
U||Le juge s’adressa alors à Banker, qu’il condamna à un an de prison et à une amende de 1000 roupies, ou à défaut à six mois de prison supplémentaires.
U||GANDHI SUR LE JUGEMENT
U||Gandhi demande la parole:
U||«Puisque vous m’avez fait l’honneur de rappeler le procès de feu Lockmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, permettez-moi de dire que je considère comme un privilège et comme un honneur dont je suis fier, de voir mon nom associé au sien. La sentence en elle-même est aussi légère qu’il est possible à un juge de la rendre et je dois ajouter que je ne pouvais m’attendre à plus de courtoisie.»
U||Les amis de Gandhi s’empressèrent alors autour de lui; lorsque le juge fut sorti, ils tombèrent à ses pieds en sanglotant. Gandhi ne cessa de sourire, d’être calme et d’encourager ceux qui venaient lui dire adieu. Banker souriait aussi et prenait la chose gaîment. Lorsqu’il eut pris congé de tous ses 377 amis, Gandhi quitta le tribunal, et fut conduit à la prison de Sabarmati.

U||MESSAGE DE MADAME GANDHI
U||Chers Compatriotes et Chères Compatriotes,
U||Mon mari a été condamné aujourd’hui à six années de prison. Je ne saurais nier qu’une peine aussi sévère ne m’ait été très dure. Je me suis consolée cependant, en me disant qu’il n’est pas au-delà de notre pouvoir de réduire cette peine et par nos efforts de le délivrer avant la fin.
U||Je ne doute pas que si l’Inde se réveille et se met sérieusement au programme constructif du Congrès, non seulement nous parviendrons à obtenir sa liberté, mais aussi à résoudre d’une façon satisfaisante les trois questions pour lesquelles nous avons lutté et souffert depuis dix-huit mois.
U||Le remède est donc entre nos mains. Si nous échouons, ce sera notre faute. Je fais donc appel à tous les hommes et à toutes les femmes ayant de la sympathie pour mon mari, et je leur demande de concentrer tous leurs efforts sur le programme constructif, afin qu’il réussisse entièrement.
U||378
U||Parmi les diverses questions au programme, il insista particulièrement sur le rouet et sur le Khaddar. Notre succès dans ces deux questions résoudra non seulement le problème économique pour les masses, mais nous affranchira également de l’esclavage politique.
U||La première réponse de l’Inde à la condamnation de M. Gandhi doit donc être:
U||1o Que tout homme et toute femme cesse d’employer le tissu étranger, adopte le Khaddar et persuade aux autres d’en faire autant;
U||2o Que toute femme considère comme son devoir religieux de filer chaque jour et persuade aux autres de faire de même;
U||3o Que tout marchand cesse d’acheter et de vendre des pièces de tissu étranger.
U||Kasturibai Gandhi.

U||[31] Lire le curieux article: «Mon Inconséquence», 23 février 1921,—où il explique sa campagne de recrutement en 1914. Sa foi dans l’Ahimsâ (Non-Violence) est, dit-il, absolue. Mais la plupart des hommes ne croient pas à l’Ahimsâ; ils croient à la Violence; et pourtant ils refusent de faire leur devoir selon le monde de la Violence,—leur devoir national et patriotique.—«Je le leur expliquai, écrit Gandhi. Je leur expliquai aussi la doctrine d’Ahimsâ et les laissai choisir. C’est ce qu’ils ont fait. Je ne m’en repens pas. Car même sous le Swarâj (c’est-à-dire dans une Inde libérée), je n’hésiterais pas à conseiller à ceux qui auraient le désir de prendre les armes de se battre pour leur pays».

U||De même, à propos de son fameux livre sur l’Hind Swarâj (Home Rule de l’Inde): «Je tiens à prévenir le lecteur qu’il ne doit pas s’imaginer que je cherche l’H. S. tel qu’il y est décrit. Je sais que l’Inde n’est pas mûre pour cela... Je travaille individuellement pour arriver à la maîtrise personnelle qui y est décrite; mais aujourd’hui, je consacre mon activité publique au Swarâj parlementaire, tel que le désire le peuple.»
U||Toujours cette vue à plusieurs plans, ce sens aigu des différences de devoirs inégalement répartis sur terre. Ils s’accordent sans doute avec sa conception hindoue des castes et des dharmas différents.

U||[52] Cette conférence avait été précédée le 17 octobre de la Journée du Califat (Khilafat Day). Le 22 du même mois, dans la Jeune Inde, Gandhi écrivait:
U||«Le 17 octobre sera longtemps considéré comme une journée mémorable dans l’histoire de l’Inde. Qu’une démonstration comme celle qui fut organisée le 17 courant ait pu avoir lieu sans le moindre obstacle est à l’éloge des organisateurs, et assurément une victoire remportée par le Satyâgraha. On commence à se rendre compte que ce n’est pas par la violence que les grandes causes se gagnent, mais par un accord paisible et un effort soutenu.
U||«Dès que le peuple cessera de craindre la force, le Gouvernement s’apercevra qu’elle ne sert à rien et que seuls ceux-là qui ne la craignent point se refusent à l’employer. Ceux qui sont au pouvoir se plaisent en général aux démonstrations violentes du peuple. L’art de gouverner consiste à avoir à sa disposition des forces suffisantes pour contraindre par la terreur le peuple à la soumission. Et un gouvernement n’est un instrument de service qu’autant qu’il est fondé sur la volonté et le consentement du peuple. Il n’est qu’un instrument d’oppression lorsqu’il obtient l’obéissance à la pointe des baïonnettes... Les organisateurs de la Journée du Califat semblent avoir compris le principe fondamental du Satyâgraha. Ils auraient fait le jeu de leur adversaire, si directement ou indirectement ils avaient incité à la violence ou même si la violence avait résulté de la démonstration.
U||La cause de l’Islam a gagné par la nature pacifique de la démonstration. Et l’organisation de la police à Bombay mérite les louanges les plus grandes, car à Bombay de même qu’à Ahmedabad, aucune mesure de précaution particulière ne semblait avoir été prise. Absence de tout déploiement de forces. La présence de forces policières et de troupes irrite toujours la populace. Les organisateurs méritent des louanges analogues pour avoir évité des rassemblements et tout ce qui tend à réunir des multitudes ignorantes et irresponsables.
U||La question du Califat est épineuse. Elle a été rendue plus complexe encore par suite de traités secrets. Mais tout espoir n’est pas perdu... Il ne faut ni tapage, ni mise en scène, ni déclamation, ni réclame. Il faut agir tranquillement et sincèrement... Le loyalisme n’est pas un principe immuable, il est un accord réciproque. Un gouvernement loyal envers ses administrés obtient nécessairement leur loyalisme. Quand notre gouvernement cesse d’être loyal, c’est-à-dire s’il devient systématiquement injuste et oppresseur, nous devons sans la moindre hésitation proclamer notre défection, lui retirer notre appui et conseiller cette attitude autour de nous. C’est là une forme de boycottage que nous jugerions de notre devoir si l’occasion s’en présentait. Mais boycotter des marchandises anglaises tout en conservant nos relations avec les Anglais nous semble la plus grande des sottises. Nos amis Mahométans ont une cause beaucoup trop sacrée pour jouer avec l’emploi d’une arme 
U||aussi douteuse que celle du boycottage. Ils savent à présent, et le monde entier sait, que leur cause n’est pas seulement celle de quatre-vingt millions de Mahométans, mais également celle de deux cent millions d’Hindous. Le 17 octobre a démontré que le lien qui les unit existe vraiment et qu’il ira en se resserrant de plus en plus. Une Inde forte et unie ne saurait manquer d’être écoutée avec attention et respect par les alliés de la Grande-Bretagne.
U||[53] En donnant son assentiment à l’Indian Reform Act de 1919, le Roi-Empereur publia une proclamation, dont voici quelques extraits:
U||«Je désire sincèrement que, dans la mesure du possible, toute trace de ressentiment soit effacée entre Mon peuple et ceux qui sont à la tête de Mon Gouvernement. Que ceux qui ont enfreint les lois dans leur ardent désir de progrès politique les respectent à l’avenir. Qu’il devienne possible à ceux qui sont chargés de maintenir un Gouvernement paisible et calme, d’oublier les folies auxquelles ils ont été contraints de mettre un frein. Une ère nouvelle commence. Qu’elle débute par une résolution générale de la part de Mon peuple et de ceux qui Me représentent de travailler ensemble pour un but commun. Je charge donc Mon Vice-roi d’exercer en Mon Nom et en Ma Personne la Clémence Royale envers les condamnés politiques aussi complètement que la sécurité publique le permet. Je désire que cette même clémence s’étende dans les mêmes conditions aux personnes actuellement en prison ou dont la liberté est restreinte pour avoir commis des délits contre l’Etat ou qui ont enf
U||reint certaines lois particulières et provisoires. Je suis persuadé que la conduite future de ceux qui en profiteront justifiera cette clémence et que dorénavant Mes sujets agiront de telle sorte qu’il ne soit point nécessaire d’appliquer les lois contre de pareilles offenses».

U||[59] Le 23 juin 1919, Gandhi écrivait déjà dans la Jeune Inde:
U||«Il se passera peut-être un temps considérable avant que la loi d’Amour soit reconnue dans les affaires internationales. Les rouages des gouvernements s’interposent, masquant au cœur d’un peuple le cœur des autres peuples. Et pourtant, si seulement nous considérions les derniers événements internationaux en Europe et en Asie Orientale, en songeant à ce qui est essentiel, il nous serait possible de voir que le monde en arrive peu à peu à comprendre qu’il en est entre nations comme il en est entre hommes; que la force seule est impuissante à résoudre les problèmes et que la sanction économique de Non-Coopération est beaucoup plus efficace que les armées et les marines. Les victoires de la guerre n’ont fait qu’ajouter de nouvelles charges aux nations qui sortirent de la lutte apparemment victorieuses. La question des vivres et de l’industrie dans les nations vaincues est une source d’inquiétude non moins grande pour les vainqueurs que pour ces nations elles-mêmes. Toute l’ha
U||bileté des gouvernements des nations alliées tend à démontrer, et cela sans rien enlever à la gloire des vainqueurs, qu’ils peuvent rendre le peuple vaincu solvable économiquement, heureux et désireux de travailler pour le reste du monde. Si on lit entre les lignes du court télégramme exposant le programme international du parti républicain en Amérique, on peut voir que le Far West commence à se rendre compte que la sanction définitive d’une Ligue des Nations devrait être, non le cercle vicieux de la force des armées, mais la force de ce qui est internationalement en dehors des lois, c’est-à-dire la Non-Coopération. De là, il serait aisé d’arriver à reconnaître absolument la loi d’Amour. Jusqu’au jour où une énergie nouvelle est captée et dirigée, les capitaines des énergies anciennes la traiteront d’idéaliste, de théorique et de non pratique. Nous pouvons avoir la certitude que le marchand de chevaux se moqua de l’ingénieur qui mit en mouvement la machine à vape
U||ur, jusqu’au jour où il s’aperçut que la machine à vapeur était capable de transporter même ses chevaux. L’ingénieur électricien fut probablement traité de maniaque et de fou dans les milieux de locomotion à vapeur, jusqu’au jour où un travail s’accomplit grâce aux fils électriques. Il faudra peut-être longtemps pour poser les fils d’amour international; mais la sanction de Non-Coopération internationale, telle qu’elle me semble avoir été conçue par le parti républicain en Amérique, est de préférence à la contrainte physique, un progrès sensible vers la solution véritable et définitive...»

U||[63] La note suivante parue dans la Jeune Inde donne quelques explications complémentaires sur la position de Gandhi:
U||«Un Messager de Dieu.—Je viens de recevoir une coupure de journal, où l’on m’attribue l’honneur d’être un messager de Dieu et où l’on me demande si je prétends avoir reçu de Dieu certaines révélations particulières. J’ai déjà parlé des miracles que l’on me prête. Et quant à cette nouvelle fonction, il faut que je la désavoue. Je prie, comme tout bon Hindou. Je crois que nous pouvons tous devenir des messagers de Dieu, si nous cessons de craindre les hommes et ne cherchons que la Vérité de Dieu. Je crois fermement que je ne cherche pas autre chose que la Vérité de Dieu et que je n’ai plus aucune crainte des hommes. Je sens donc d’une façon certaine que Dieu est avec le Mouvement de Non-Coopération. Je n’ai aucune révélation de la Volonté divine. J’ai la foi absolue que Dieu se révèle chaque jour à tout être humain, mais que nous sommes sourds à la «petite voix silencieuse». Nous fermons les yeux et nous ne voyons pas la colonne de feu qui se trouve devant
U|| nous. Je sens son omniprésence. L’auteur de l’article peut faire comme moi.»

U||«Un Blasphème.—Un correspondant m’écrit: «J’ai le regret de vous informer que l’on voit constamment des images de vous et d’autres chefs, représentés sous les traits de Shri-Krishna et de Pandavas. N’allez-vous pas profiter de votre influence pour y mettre fin, car cela doit froisser les sentiments religieux d’un grand nombre pour qui, comme pour moi, Shri-Krishna est non seulement un grand homme mais Dieu incarné?»
U||«Ce correspondant a toute ma sympathie. Je n’ai pas vu les gravures en question, mais je considère que c’est un blasphème de me représenter sous les traits de Shri-Krishna. Je n’ai pas la prétention d’être autre chose qu’un humble travailleur parmi beaucoup d’autres, pour une noble cause qui perdrait plutôt qu’elle ne gagnerait à la glorification de ses chefs. Une cause a de meilleures chances de réussir, lorsqu’on l’examine et qu’on la juge sur son propre mérite. Dans une société qui progresse, les moyens employés doivent toujours être considérés avant les hommes, qui ne sont après tout que des instruments imparfaits travaillant à leur propre réalisation. Je supplierai donc de toutes mes forces les enthousiastes ou les hommes d’affaires entreprenants d’observer le sens des proportions et de supprimer de la circulation toutes images de ce genre, dont l’intention est manifestement de blesser les susceptibilités profondément religieuses.»

U||«Mon Ambition.—Un correspondant persistant de Simla me demande si j’ai l’intention de former une secte et de prétendre à la divinité. Je lui ai répondu une lettre personnelle, mais il voudrait dans l’intérêt de la postérité que je le déclare publiquement. Je pensais avoir nié dans les termes les plus énergiques toute prétention à la divinité. Je prétends n’être qu’un humble serviteur de l’Inde et de l’humanité, et je voudrais mourir à son service. Je n’ai aucun désir de former une secte, j’ai réellement trop d’ambition pour me contenter seulement d’une secte qui me suive. Je ne représente aucune idée nouvelle. J’essaye de me laisser guider par la Vérité et de la représenter telle que je la connais. Je prétends certainement jeter une nouvelle lumière sur mainte vérité ancienne. J’espère que cette déclaration satisfera celui qui me questionne et d’autres comme lui.»

U||[65] Magistrat.
U||[66] Les rapports de Gandhi avec le mouvement sont expliqués en détail, dans la fameuse lettre qu’il adressa au Vice-Roi, pour l’inauguration de la Non-Coopération. Il écrit:
U||«Votre Excellence,
U||«Comme dans une certaine mesure vous m’avez honoré de votre confiance et que je souhaite sincèrement le bien de l’Empire Britannique, je considère que je dois à Votre Excellence de lui expliquer, et par son intermédiaire, d’expliquer aux ministres de Sa Majesté, mon attitude au sujet de la question du Califat.
U||«Tout à fait au début de la guerre, alors que j’organisais à Londres un Corps d’Ambulanciers, la question du Califat commençait déjà à m’intéresser. Je sentis combien le petit monde musulman de Londres était ému, lorsque la Turquie décida de mêler son sort à celui de l’Allemagne. Lorsque je rentrai aux Indes en janvier 1915, je retrouvai chez les Musulmans que je rencontrai la même inquiétude ardente. Elle devint intense, lorsque la nouvelle des traités secrets se répandit. Leur esprit s’emplit de méfiance, et le désespoir s’empara d’eux. Déjà à cette époque, je conseillai à mes amis musulmans de ne pas se laisser aller au désespoir, mais d’exprimer leur crainte et leurs espérances, d’une façon disciplinée. Il faut admettre que pendant ces cinq années dernières l’Inde musulmane a su remarquablement se contenir et que les chefs ont su conserver sur les sections turbulentes de la communauté une autorité absolue.
U||«Les conditions de la paix et la défense qu’en a prise Votre Excellence donnèrent aux Musulmans de l’Inde un coup dont ils se remettront difficilement. Les conditions violent toutes les promesses ministérielles et ne tiennent aucun compte des sentiments musulmans. Je considère qu’étant un Hindou sincère, désirant conserver avec mes compatriotes musulmans les rapports les plus amicaux, je serais un fils indigne de l’Inde si je ne les soutenais, à l’heure de l’épreuve. Leur cause, à mon humble opinion, est juste. Ils déclarent que si l’on respecte leurs sentiments, il ne faut pas «punir» la Turquie. Les soldats musulmans ne se sont pas battus pour infliger à leur propre Calife une punition, ni pour le priver de ses territoires. Pendant la durée entière de ces cinq années, l’attitude des Musulmans a été conséquente avec elle-même.
U||«Mon devoir envers l’Empire, auquel je dois fidélité, m’oblige à combattre la violence cruelle faite aux sentiments musulmans. Autant qu’il m’est possible d’en juger, la plupart des Hindous et des Musulmans ne croient plus à la justice et à l’honneur britanniques. Le rapport de la majorité du Comité Hunter, la dépêche de Votre Excellence à ce sujet et la réponse de M. Montague n’ont fait qu’augmenter la méfiance.
U||«Etant donné ces circonstances, il n’y a pas d’autre parti à prendre, pour un homme comme moi, que de rompre tout rapport avec l’administration britannique ou, si je crois encore à la supériorité de sa constitution sur les autres actuellement en vigueur, d’adopter les moyens qui me permettront de réparer le mal qui a été accompli et de faire renaître ainsi la confiance. Je n’ai pas cessé de croire à cette supériorité et je ne désespère pas que d’une façon quelconque justice soit faite si nous savons nous montrer suffisamment capables de souffrir. En vérité, mon opinion sur cette Constitution, c’est qu’elle ne vient en aide qu’à ceux qui s’aident eux-mêmes. Je ne crois pas qu’elle protège les faibles. Elle laisse une entière liberté aux forts, pour qu’ils conservent et développent leur force. Sous cette Constitution, les faibles sont écrasés.
U||«C’est donc parce que j’ai foi dans la Constitution Britannique que j’ai conseillé à mes amis Musulmans de retirer leur concours au Gouvernement de Votre Excellence, et aux Hindous de se joindre à eux, si les conditions de la paix ne sont pas révisées et réglées d’après les promesses solennelles faites par les Ministres et d’accord avec les sentiments musulmans.
U||«Trois moyens s’offraient aux Musulmans pour montrer énergiquement leur désapprobation de l’injustice extrême dont les Ministres de sa Majesté s’étaient rendus complices, s’ils n’en ont pas été réellement les auteurs; ce sont:
U||1o Avoir recours à la violence.
U||2o Conseiller l’émigration en masse.
U||3o Ne pas être complice de l’Injustice, en refusant de coopérer avec le Gouvernement.
U||«Votre Excellence doit savoir qu’il fut un temps où les plus hardis, quoique les moins réfléchis des Musulmans, étaient en faveur de la violence; et l’«Hijrat» (émigration) n’a pas encore cessé d’être un cri de guerre. J’ose prétendre qu’à force de raisonner avec patience, je suis parvenu à détourner le parti de la violence de ses façons de procéder. J’avoue que je n’ai pas réussi (je ne l’ai même pas essayé) à le détourner de la violence pour des raisons morales, mais pour des raisons utilitaires. Le résultat fut en tout cas pour l’instant d’empêcher la violence. Le parti de l’Hijrat a été réprimé, mais son activité n’a pas été complètement anéantie. Je suis persuadé qu’aucune répression n’eût pu empêcher une éruption violente, si le peuple ne lui avait opposé une forme d’action directe qui demandait un sacrifice considérable et qui assurait le succès, une fois adoptée largement par le public. La Non-Coopération était la seule maniè
U||re digne et constitutionnelle d’une action directe de ce genre. Car c’est un droit reconnu de temps immémorial que le sujet peut refuser son aide au maître qui gouverne mal.
U||«J’admets cependant qu’il y a de grands risques à ce que la Non-Coopération soit entreprise par des masses. Mais dans une crise comme celle que traversent les Musulmans, il n’existe pas de mesure sans risques qui puisse amener le résultat désiré. Ne pas courir de risques à présent, c’est en provoquer de bien plus grands, sinon la destruction virtuelle de la Loi et de l’Ordre.
U||«Il reste cependant un moyen d’échapper à la Non-Coopération. La délégation musulmane a demandé à Votre Excellence de diriger vous-même l’agitation, ainsi que l’a fait votre distingué prédécesseur, au moment des difficultés Sud-Africaines. Mais si vous trouvez que cela vous est impossible et si la Non-Coopération devient une nécessité absolue, j’espère que Votre Excellence me fera l’honneur de croire que ceux qui ont suivi mes conseils et moi-même sommes guidés uniquement par un sentiment rigoureux de notre devoir.
U||«J’ai l’honneur de demeurer le fidèle serviteur de Votre Excellence.
U||M. K. Gandhi.»
U||[67] Dans un article du 22 décembre de la même année M. Gandhi exprimera ce qu’il pense du «Péché du Secret».
U||«Un des fléaux de l’Inde est souvent le péché du secret. Par crainte des conséquences nous conversons à voix basse. Nulle part ce secret ne m’a obsédé comme au Bengale. Tout le monde veut vous adresser la parole «en particulier». J’ai été vivement peiné de voir des jeunes gens innocents regarder autour d’eux avant d’ouvrir la bouche pour s’assurer qu’un tiers ne les écoutait pas. L’on y soupçonne tout étranger de faire partie de la police secrète. On m’a conseillé de me défier des étrangers. Ma coupe de tristesse fut pleine à déborder lorsqu’on m’eût dit que l’étudiant inconnu qui présidait la séance était de la police secrète. Je pourrais citer le nom d’au moins deux chefs éminents et appartenant à la haute société indienne que l’on accuse d’être des espions du gouvernement.
U||Je remercie Dieu d’être parvenu depuis des années à considérer le secret comme un péché, surtout en matière politique. Si nous avions conscience que Dieu est présent et qu’il est témoin de tout ce que nous faisons, nous n’aurions rien à cacher à personne ici-bas. Nous n’oserions avoir de mauvaises pensées devant notre Créateur et encore moins les exprimer. L’impureté seule cherche l’obscurité et le secret. La tendance de la nature humaine est de cacher ce qui est sale, nous n’aimons ni toucher ni voir les choses malpropres; nous les dissimulons. Et ainsi en est-il de nos paroles... Le moyen le meilleur et le plus rapide de nous débarrasser de cette police secrète dégradante et corrosive est de faire un effort pour penser tout haut, de n’avoir de conversation privée avec personne et de cesser de craindre les espions. Il faut ignorer leur présence et traiter chacun comme un ami qui possède le droit de connaître toutes nos pensées et tous nos projets.
U||Je sais que j’ai atteint les résultats les plus satisfaisants en développant au grand jour mes plans les plus hardis. Je n’ai jamais perdu une seconde de ma tranquillité parce qu’il y avait des détectives près de moi. Le public ignore peut-être que, pendant toute la durée de mon séjour dans l’Inde, j’ai été filé. Non seulement je n’en ai éprouvé aucun ennui mais j’ai même accepté quelques services amicaux de la part de ces messieurs et certains se sont excusés d’être forcés de me suivre. En général ce que je disais devant eux, tout le monde en avait déjà connaissance. Il en résulte qu’à présent je ne fais pas même attention à leur présence et je doute que le gouvernement soit beaucoup plus avancé parce que mes actions ont été surveillées par ses agents secrets...».

U||[71] M. Gandhi écrit dans la Jeune Inde du 27 octobre 1920 sous le titre «Notre dernier voyage».—Mon expérience s’enrichit tellement à chacun de mes voyages qu’il m’est difficile d’en donner au lecteur un compte rendu régulier. Il faut donc que je me contente d’ajouter à notre fonds en parlant de la nécessité de la discipline et de l’organisation. J’ai déjà raconté nos expériences jusqu’au voyage à Cawnpore. J’appréhendais notre arrivée... Les dispositions prises à la gare ne laissaient rien à désirer. Une foule énorme était venue à notre rencontre, mais la discipline était si parfaite que nous pûmes passer entre deux rangées serrées d’hommes sans qu’un seul bougeât avant que nous ayons pris place dans les automobiles. Ce qui aurait pu nous faire perdre une demi-heure prit cinq minutes. Le cortège avait été heureusement supprimé. Le programme de la journée était organisé avec autant de méthode que la réception à la gare. Nous étions arrivés à hu
U||it heures et n’avions qu’une journée à notre disposition, mais dans cet intervalle, il nous fut possible d’assister à une réunion des travailleurs, d’avoir une entrevue personnelle avec M. Frazier Hunt du Chicago Tribune, de nous rendre au Home pour les Veuves, d’inaugurer l’Ecole nationale de Gujerati, d’assister à une réunion des dames du Gujerat, d’inaugurer un tribunal national d’arbitrage, d’assister à une réunion en plein air et enfin de causer avec les visiteurs. Tout cela eut lieu sans précipitation et sans fatigue inutile. Il y eut un peu de confusion tout d’abord à la réunion en plein air. Nous apprîmes qu’aucun ordre n’avait été donné aux volontaires, mais après quelque difficulté un silence parfait régna, et l’auditoire écouta dans le silence le plus absolu trois solides discours. Je suis convaincu que dès que nous serons organisés le «Swaraj» sera établi. Dans un pays comme le nôtre il suffit du refus organisé de nous laisser gouverner par un
U||e puissance étrangère... Le voyage de nuit jusqu’à Bhiwani ne nous laissa pas une seconde de repos. La foule insista pour que nous nous montrions. Quelqu’un fit entendre que les «Mahatmas» n’avaient pas besoin de repos et que c’était leur devoir de se montrer. Certains devinrent positivement furieux parce que nous refusâmes énergiquement de nous lever. Un autre fit la remarque qu’il était très imprudent de notre part de ne pas respecter le désir du peuple en nous levant pour nous laisser voir. Enfin, n’ayant pas dormi nous atteignîmes Bhiwani. Environ 40.000 personnes étaient venues des villages d’alentour. Je craignais que nous ne fussions complètement écrasés mais à mon agréable surprise l’ordre fut parfait. Ni bousculade ni allées et venues inutiles et bruyantes à la gare, chacun resta à sa place. La procession s’organisa sans difficulté malgré une foule compacte. L’ordre au Pandal fut encore plus remarquable. C’était une immense construction sans aucune prét
U||ention artistique. Il n’y avait pas de chaises même pour le Président. Les visiteurs de marque étaient assis sur une estrade massive et pratique construite au centre du Pandal. Bien qu’il y eût plus de douze mille personnes, le Pandal semblait spacieux. On y accédait par de larges voies. Le sol était creusé de façon à s’incliner vers le centre. Il était possible à tous de voir sans difficulté. Ma seule remarque c’est que le demi-cercle est préférable, aucune place ne devant se trouver derrière l’estrade...
U||M’étant renseigné j’appris que cette fois la foule était venue des alentours uniquement pour nous voir. L’obligation de se montrer est devenue des plus embarrassantes et prend beaucoup de temps. Elle m’oblige à une tension nerveuse excessive et me prive de la tranquillité dont j’aurais besoin pour écrire pendant les rares instants dont je dispose pendant mes voyages. Un manque de réflexion en est largement responsable. Il faut que les travailleurs pour la cause organisent ces manifestations avec méthode ou qu’elles soient tout à fait supprimées. Heureusement qu’elles sont amicales et n’occasionnent jamais de troubles. Mais imaginez la confusion si nous entreprenions des manifestations hostiles. Qu’arriverait-il s’il nous fallait diriger de telles foules sous le feu ou si elles étaient excitées par la colère? Je me rendis compte à Tundla que la Désobéissance Civile en masse était impossible avec une foule comme celle qui s’y trouvait. Nous ne pouvons rien accomplir d’e
U||fficace si nous n’avons la certitude lorsque nous communiquons nos instructions d’être obéis implicitement. Il faut donc que les «volontaires» apprennent à diriger la foule. Une foule indienne devient aisément des plus dociles et des plus maniables, seulement il faut l’y préparer. Et quand elle ne l’est pas il est plus sage de ne pas organiser de rassemblements.

U||[74] Le 27 octobre 1920 sous le titre «Classes déprimées» M. Gandhi avait écrit un article sur la question des intouchables.
U||Vivekananda appelait les Panchamas «classes supprimées.» Sans nul doute son épithète est plus exacte que la mienne. Nous les avons supprimés et nous nous sommes déprimés nous-mêmes. C’est à la justice vengeresse mesurée par un Dieu juste que nous devons, selon Gokhale, d’être devenus les parias de l’Empire. Un correspondant me demande avec indignation ce que je fais pour eux. Nous autres Hindous ne devrions-nous pas laver nos mains sanglantes avant de demander aux Anglais de laver les leurs? La question est juste et opportune. Et s’il était possible à un membre d’une nation esclave de délivrer de leur esclavage les classes supprimées sans s’affranchir du sien je le ferais immédiatement. Mais c’est une tâche impossible. Un esclave n’a même pas la liberté nécessaire pour faire ce qu’il doit... Si j’avais une législature vraiment nationale je répondrais à l’insolence hindoue en faisant construire des puits spéciaux pour les classes supprimées, je créerais des éc
U||oles plus nombreuses et meilleures pour qu’il ne reste pas un seul intouchable ne sachant où envoyer ses enfants, mais je dois attendre encore ce jour meilleur.
U||Faut-il entre temps laisser les classes déprimées s’arranger comme elles peuvent? Certes non.—Personnellement j’ai fait et fais encore à mon humble façon ce que je peux pour mes frères Panchamas.
U||Ces membres de la nation foulés aux pieds ont trois ressources. S’ils sont impatients ils peuvent demander l’appui du Gouvernement qui est le maître des esclaves. Ils l’obtiendront mais le remède sera pire que le mal. Aujourd’hui ils sont les esclaves d’esclaves. S’ils cherchent l’appui du Gouvernement celui-ci se servira d’eux pour anéantir leurs propres frères. Au lieu que l’on continue à pécher envers eux ce sont eux qui pécheront envers les autres. Les Musulmans ont essayé sans succès, ils se sont aperçus qu’ils perdaient au lieu d’y gagner. Les Sikhs le firent imprudemment et échouèrent; nulle communauté de l’Inde n’est plus mécontente que la leur. L’aide du Gouvernement n’est donc pas une solution.
U||La seconde serait pour eux de renoncer à l’Hindouisme ou de se convertir en bloc à l’Islamisme ou au Christianisme. Si une amélioration matérielle pouvait excuser que l’on renie sa religion je n’hésiterais pas à le conseiller. Mais la religion est une question de cœur. Il n’est pas d’incommodité physique qui puisse vous autoriser à renier votre religion. Si la façon inhumaine de traiter les Panchamas faisait partie de l’Hindouisme, le renier deviendrait un devoir pour eux et pour ceux qui comme moi ne faisons pas un fétiche de la religion et n’excusons pas tous les maux en son nom. Mais je suis persuadé que l’Intouchabilité ne fait pas partie de l’Hindouisme. C’en est plutôt une excroissance qu’il faut détruire à tout prix. Et il existe une véritable armée de réformateurs hindous qui ont à cœur de débarrasser l’Hindouisme de cette souillure. Je considère par conséquent que la conversion ne serait point un remède.
U||Il leur reste enfin la ressource d’agir par eux-mêmes et de se défendre avec l’aide que les Hindous non-Panchamas leur donneront, non par protection mais par devoir. Voilà où la Non-Coopération pourrait servir. Je serais, en effet partisan d’une Non-Coopération méthodique pour remédier à ce mal reconnu. Mais la Non-Coopération signifie indépendance absolue de toute aide extérieure, c’est un effort intérieur. Vouloir absolument pénétrer dans les enceintes défendues ne serait pas de la Non-Coopération. Ce pourrait être considéré comme de la Désobéissance Civile si c’était accompli pacifiquement. Mais j’ai découvert à mes dépens que la Désobéissance Civile demande une préparation préliminaire bien plus grande et beaucoup plus d’empire sur soi-même. Tout le monde peut non-coopérer, mais il en est peu qui soient capables de Désobéissance Civile. Pour protester contre l’Hindouisme les Panchamas peuvent donc cesser tout contact et tous rapports avec les autres hindo
U||us tant que les causes de leur grief persisteront. Mais si je ne me trompe les Panchamas n’ont pas de chef capable de les conduire à la victoire par la Non-Coopération.
U||Le meilleur moyen serait donc que les Panchamas se joignissent au grand mouvement national pour libérer l’Inde de l’esclavage auquel la soumet le Gouvernement actuel. Il est facile à nos amis Panchamas de voir que la Non-Coopération contre ce gouvernement malfaisant suppose une coopération entre les différentes sections qui composent la nation indienne. Les Hindous doivent comprendre que s’ils veulent non-coopérer avec succès il leur faut faire cause commune avec les Panchamas comme ils ont fait cause commune avec les Musulmans. La Non-Coopération sans violence est essentiellement un mouvement de purification personnelle intensive. Cette opération a déjà commencé, et que les Panchamas y prennent part volontairement ou non, les autres Hindous n’oseront pas les laisser de côté sans nuire à leur propre progrès. Par conséquent, bien que la question des Panchamas me soit aussi chère que l’existence même, je me borne à consacrer toute mon attention à la Non-Coopération nationale. Je
U|| suis convaincu que le plus renferme le moins...
U||[75] Congrès de Nagpur tenu en décembre 1920.
U||[76] L’interview suivante parue d’abord dans l’Indian Witness de Lucknow et reproduite ensuite dans la Jeune Inde du 25 février 1920 sous le titre «Nettoyez» nous rend encore plus claires les idées de M. Gandhi à ce sujet et donne en même temps son portrait physique et moral.
U||«Tout en causant avec M. Gandhi je remarquai non sans étonnement la simplicité de son costume. Il était vêtu d’étoffe blanche grossière, un kambal jeté sur ses épaules le protégeait du froid, un bonnet blanc lui couvrait la tête. Il était assis sur le sol en face de moi et je me demandais comment ce petit individu au visage maigre, aux grandes oreilles écartées, aux tranquilles yeux bruns pouvait bien être le célèbre Gandhi dont j’avais tant entendu parler. Mais tous mes doutes disparurent lorsque nous commençâmes à causer. Je n’approuve pas toutes les méthodes de M. Gandhi pour atteindre le but souhaité, mais je tiens à rendre à l’homme ce témoignage: M. Gandhi est un spiritualiste, c’est un penseur. Pendant ma courte entrevue avec lui j’éprouvais ce même sentiment de communion que j’ai éprouvée maintes fois avec les Saints. Je compris que cet homme était allé à la source même de la foi chrétienne et qu’il avait puisé ses connaissances auprès du Christ.
U||—«M. Gandhi, que peuvent faire les Nations occidentales pour aider au développement de l’Orient et de l’Inde en particulier? M. Gandhi répondit à ma question d’une façon détournée:
U||—«Pour l’instant, dit-il, l’Inde désapprend. L’Inde a appris une foule de choses inutiles qui ne lui servent à rien. En observant l’Occident et votre pays en particulier j’ai appris deux choses de la première importance, d’abord la propreté, ensuite l’énergie. Je suis absolument convaincu que mes compatriotes ne peuvent progresser spirituellement avant d’avoir fait un nettoyage complet. Votre peuple possède une énergie surprenante; cette énergie est en grande partie dirigée vers un but matériel. Si cette même somme d’énergie pouvait être dirigée convenablement chez le peuple indien, ce serait pour lui un précieux bienfait.
U||—«Auriez-vous la bonté de me dire ce que le Christianisme peut faire pour aider l’Inde, étant donné l’esprit de nationalisme qui règne à l’étranger?» Il me répondit: «Ce dont nous avons besoin avant tout c’est de sympathie. Lorsque j’étais dans l’Afrique du Sud j’ai découvert cette comparaison. Il me fallait creuser des puits artésiens. Pour atteindre aux sources courantes et pures je devais creuser à une très grande profondeur. Un grand nombre de ceux qui viennent ici afin d’étudier mes compatriotes se contentent de gratter à la surface. Si par leur sympathie ils creusaient profondément ils découvriraient une source de vie pure et claire».
U||—«Auriez-vous également la bonté de me dire quels livres ou quelles personnes ont exercé sur vous le plus d’influence?» Je m’attendais à ce qu’il me parlât des Vedas et autres livres indiens que devraient connaître les Chrétiens mais je ne m’attendais pas à l’entendre citer trois livres anglais[77] qui avaient dirigé sa vie et formé sa pensée. Il admit franchement qu’il n’était pas lecteur omnivore, qu’il choisissait avec soin ce qu’il y avait de meilleur. Et voici l’ordre dans lequel il me nomma ces livres: La Bible, Ruskin et Tolstoï. Puis parlant de la Bible il me dit: «Il m’est arrivé maintes fois de ne savoir de quel côté me diriger. Je suis allé à la Bible et particulièrement au Nouveau Testament et dans son message j’ai puisé des forces.»
U||Je tenais beaucoup à savoir ce que notre association de diplômés de l’Université de Meerut qui était composée de l’élite des hommes instruits de cette ville pouvait faire pour en augmenter la prospérité. Il répondit: «Qu’ils soient boueurs». Il ajouta: «j’emploie cette expression dans toute sa force. Si les membres de votre association pouvaient prêter une main charitable pour nettoyer la cité moralement et matériellement ils accompliraient une tâche importante.»
U||[77] C’est-à-dire lus en anglais. (N. d. T.)
U||[78] Qu’est-ce que le Swaraj? le Times demande si j’ai des notions précises sur le Swaraj. Si l’auteur veut se reporter aux anciens numéros de la Jeune Inde il trouvera une réponse complète à sa question mais je puis mentionner ici que le Swaraj signifie au moins un accord avec le Gouvernement tel que le désirent les représentants que le peuple s’est choisi. Par conséquent si les représentants du Congrès peuvent appuyer leur demande par un fonds inépuisable de prisonniers ils auront une future importante part à tout accord. Swaraj signifie que l’Inde est capable d’obtenir par son insistance ce qu’elle désire. Je ne partage pas l’opinion du Vice-Roi que le Swaraj à moins qu’il ne vienne par l’épée viendra du Parlement anglais. Le Parlement ne répondra à la demande du peuple que lorsque l’épée l’y aura forcé. Les Non-Coopérateurs cherchent à employer l’épée du sacrifice de soi de préférence à l’épée d’acier. L’âme de l’Inde lutte contre l’acier
U|| britannique. Nous n’aurons pas longtemps à attendre avant de voir ce qu’est le Swaraj populaire.
U||15 décembre 1921.
U||En quoi consiste le Swaraj? Personne ne peut établir à lui seul un plan de Swaraj parce que ce n’est pas le Swaraj d’un seul qu’il nous faut. Nous ne saurions pas davantage en établir le plan d’avance. Ce qui satisfera la nation aujourd’hui peut et doit le demeurer. La volonté nationale peut changer du jour au lendemain, mais il est possible certainement d’indiquer d’avance les grandes lignes du Swaraj: il faut que les représentants de la nation aient un contrôle absolu sur l’éducation, sur la police, sur l’armée. Il faut que notre contrôle sur les finances soit absolu. Et si nous voulons gouverner nous-mêmes il ne faut pas qu’un seul soldat quitte l’Inde sans notre assentiment.
U||Qu’adviendra-t-il des Intérêts Européens? les intérêts européens seront en aussi grande sécurité dans une Inde autonome qu’actuellement, mais il n’y aura pas de privilège de supériorité de race, ni de concessions, ni d’exploitation. Les Anglais vivront dans l’Inde comme des amis dans le sens absolu de ce mot mais non pas comme des maîtres. Quant à notre association avec la Grande-Bretagne personne à ma connaissance ne désire y mettre fin pour le plaisir de le faire. Mais si la politique anglaise reste en conflit avec les sentiments musulmans à propos du Califat ou avec ceux de l’Inde pour le Pendjab il faudra que nous obtenions notre indépendance absolue. De toute façon cette association doit avoir lieu de notre plein gré et s’appuyer sur l’affection et sur l’estime.
U||L’Inde est-elle prête? C’est ce que l’avenir démontrera; pour ma part j’en suis convaincu. Le Swaraj, que réclame le Congrès n’est pas un Swaraj offert par l’Angleterre, c’est le Swaraj tel que le réclame la nation et qu’elle est capable de faire respecter, pareil à celui qu’a obtenu l’Afrique du Sud.
U||[79] Lorsque M. Gandhi parle de l’Union Hindoue-Musulmane il faut considérer cette expression dans son sens le plus large qui signifie l’Union de toutes les croyances. Voici ce qu’il écrivit dans la Jeune Inde du 15 août 1921 sous le titre Les Chrétiens et la Non-Coopération.
U||Un Chrétien Indien m’écrit:
U||«Je suis fâché que vous ne nous considériez pas, nous autres Indiens chrétiens comme faisant partie du peuple de l’Inde. J’ai remarqué bien souvent dans la Jeune Inde que vous parlez des Musulmans, des Hindous, des Sikhs mais jamais des Chrétiens.
U||«Je voudrais que vous fussiez persuadé que nous, Chrétiens indiens, faisons également partie du peuple de l’Inde et que nous nous intéressons beaucoup aux affaires personnelles de l’Inde. Je suis certain que peu d’Indiens ont pris part à la Non-Coopération aussi complètement que les chrétiens. J’ai pour mon pays une grande affection et suis moi-même un Non-Coopérateur. Je vous promets de vous adresser de temps à autre des nouvelles sur la condition des Indiens en Mésopotamie.»
U||Je puis assurer à notre correspondant et à tous les autres chrétiens que la Non-Coopération ne tient compte ni de croyances ni de race. Elle les appelle et les admet toutes dans son troupeau. Un grand nombre de chrétiens ont contribué au fonds Tilak pour le Swaraj. Il y a des Chrétiens Indiens au premier rang des Non-Coopérateurs. On parle constamment des Musulmans et des Hindous parce que jusqu’à présent ces derniers se considéraient comme des ennemis. Lorsque dans ces colonnes, une race est mentionnée spécialement c’est qu’il y a pour cela une raison particulière.
U||(Ce qui précède fut suivi de la note suivante parue le 23 septembre 1921.)
U||Non-Coopérateurs Chrétiens.—Un étudiant Chrétien m’écrit: «Bien que nous soyons des étudiants Chrétiens vous êtes notre chef national et nous avons le sentiment que c’est de vous que nous devons apprendre ce que l’Inde représente et quel est son héritage spirituel. Voulez-vous me dire quelle est votre opinion sur le Christianisme occidental et me donner quelques suggestions constructives au point de vue de son organisation, de son culte, de son ministère?» Celui qui m’interrogeait ainsi, ignorait qu’il m’entraînait au-delà de mes connaissances. J’éprouve la plus grande joie à voir l’intérêt croissant que prennent les Chrétiens indiens au grand mouvement national. Je sais que des centaines de Chrétiens pauvres de Bombay ont contribué au fonds Tilak pour le Swaraj aussi généreusement que leurs moyens le leur permettaient. Je sais qu’un certain nombre de chrétiens instruits consacrent leurs talents à l’œuvre nationale. Je me propose donc de satisfaire mon lecteur
U||, non comme il l’entend, mais de la seule façon qui me soit possible.
U||L’Inde de l’avenir immédiat représente la tolérance de toutes les religions. Son héritage spirituel c’est la simplicité de vie et la grandeur de la pensée. Je considère le Christianisme occidental tel qu’on le pratique comme une négation du Christianisme du Christ. Je ne puis m’imaginer Jésus s’il eût vécu parmi nous approuvant les institutions chrétiennes, le culte ou ses ministres modernes. Si les Chrétiens Indiens s’en tenaient au Sermon sur la Montagne que le Christ adressa, non seulement aux disciples pacifiques, mais au monde gémissant, ils ne pourraient se tromper. Ils verraient qu’aucune religion n’est fausse et que si tous vivaient selon leurs lumières et dans la crainte de Dieu, ils n’auraient pas besoin de s’inquiéter d’institutions, de formes du culte, ni de ministres. Les pharisiens avaient tout cela, mais Jésus n’en voulut point parce que leurs fonctions leur servaient à cacher leur hypocrisie ou pire encore. Coopérer avec les formes du Bien, non-coo
U||pérer avec les formes du Mal sont les deux choses indispensables pour mener une existence vertueuse et pure, qu’on l’appelle Hindoue, Musulmane ou Chrétienne.
U||[80] Le 21 juillet 1920 avait paru dans la Jeune Inde un article consacré à La musique du Rouet que nous reproduisons ci-dessous.
U||Lentement et sûrement la musique du plus ancien instrument de l’Inde pénètre dans la société. Pandit Malavijayi a déclaré qu’il ne serait pas satisfait avant que toutes les Ranis et Mahranis filent pour la nation avant que les Ranas et Mahranas soient assis derrière leurs métiers, tissant les étoffes employées par la nation. Ils ont l’exemple d’Aurangzeb qui fabriquait lui-même ses bonnets. Un plus grand Empereur Kabir, tissait lui aussi et a immortalisé son art. Les reines d’Europe filaient avant que l’Europe se laissât prendre aux pièges de Satan... «Lorsqu’Adam bêchait et qu’Eve filait qui donc était Gentilhomme?» est une phrase qui rappelle l’antique dignité de cet art... Panditji peut à juste titre espérer qu’il entraînera la noblesse de l’Inde à reprendre l’antique profession de notre terre sacrée. La renaissance de sa prospérité et de sa véritable indépendance ne dépend pas du bruit des armes, elle dépend en grande partie de la réintroduction dan
U||s chaque intérieur de la musique du rouet. Le chant en est plus doux et plus profitable que la musique exécrable des harmoniums et des accordéons...
U||Nos lecteurs n’ignorent pas qu’à Bombay les dames de familles nobles se sont déjà mises à filer. La Doctoresse Manekbai Bahudarji essaye actuellement d’introduire cet art qu’elle connaît déjà dans le Sevasadan. Son Altesse la Begum Saheba de Janjira et sa sœur Atia Begum Rahiman se sont également mises à apprendre.
U||Je sais que certains de mes amis se moquent de la tentative pour faire renaître ce grand art. Ils me rappellent qu’à notre époque de filatures, de machines à coudre et de machines à écrire il n’y a qu’un fou pour espérer faire revivre le rouet tombé en désuétude. Ces amis oublient que la machine à coudre n’a pas encore détrôné l’aiguille et que malgré la machine à écrire, la main a conservé toute sa souplesse. Il n’y a aucune raison pour que les filatures ne demeurent pas à côté du rouet comme la cuisine domestique subsiste à côté des hôtels. En vérité les machines à écrire et les machines à coudre peuvent disparaître, l’aiguille et la plume de roseau continueront à exister, les filatures peuvent être détruites, le rouet est une nécessité nationale. Je voudrais que les sceptiques se rendissent dans les humbles demeures où le rouet de nouveau augmente les faibles ressources et qu’ils demandent à ceux qui y vivent si le rouet n’a pas apporté la joie à l
U||eur foyer.
U||D’ici peu l’Inde possédera un rouet modernisé, invention merveilleuse d’un patient artisan du Deccan. Il est fait de matériaux fort simples, sa fabrication n’a rien de compliqué, il sera peu coûteux et facile à réparer. Il produira une quantité de fil supérieure à celle que produit le rouet ordinaire et peut être mis entre les mains d’un enfant de cinq ans. Mais que ce nouvel instrument donne ou non ce qu’il promet, je suis persuadé que la renaissance de ces deux arts: filage et tissage contribuera beaucoup à la régénération morale et économique de l’Inde. Il faut aux milliers d’individus une industrie simple qui s’ajoute à l’agriculture. Filer était autrefois l’industrie des campagnes et si l’on veut sauver des milliers d’êtres de la faim il faut qu’on leur donne le moyen d’introduire à nouveau le rouet dans leur demeure et que chaque village possède comme autrefois son tisserand.
U||[81] Dharma: Loi Spirituelle.
U||[82] Lokamanya veut dire vénéré du peuple.
U||[83] La Jeune Inde 4 août 1920.
U||Lokamania Bal Gangadhar Tilak n’est plus. Il est difficile de croire à sa mort. Il était si étroitement uni au peuple. Pas un homme de notre époque ne sut comme lui tenir les masses. Le dévouement qu’il obtenait de milliers de ses compatriotes était extraordinaire. Il était sans aucun doute l’idole de son peuple. Sa parole était loi pour des milliers de gens. Un géant parmi les hommes est tombé. La voix du lion s’est tue.
U||A quoi fallait-il attribuer l’influence qu’il avait sur ses compatriotes? Je crois que la question est simple. Son patriotisme était une passion. Il ne connaissait d’autre religion que son amour pour son pays. Il était démocrate-né. Il croyait à la loi de la majorité avec une intensité qui m’effrayait presque. Mais c’est à cela qu’il devait sa puissance. Il possédait une volonté de fer qu’il mettait au service de son pays. Son existence était un livre ouvert; ses goûts étaient simples et sa vie privée absolument pure. Il avait consacré à son pays ses merveilleuses facultés. Pas un homme ne prêcha l’évangile du Swaraj avec la logique et l’insistance de Lokamanya. Aussi ses compatriotes avaient en lui une foi absolue. Son courage ne l’abandonna jamais; rien ne faisait fléchir son optimisme. Il espérait voir établir le Swaraj de son vivant et, s’il n’y est point parvenu, ce n’est pas faute d’avoir tout fait pour cela. Il l’a certainement rapproché de nous de 
U||bien des années et c’est à nous, ses survivants, de redoubler d’efforts afin de l’obtenir le plus rapidement possible.
U||Lokamanya était un ennemi implacable de la bureaucratie, ce qui ne veut pas dire qu’il eût de la haine ni pour les Anglais ni pour le Gouvernement anglais. Je mets les Anglais en garde contre l’erreur de croire qu’il fut leur ennemi.
U||J’ai eu le privilège d’entendre un discours érudit et improvisé qu’il fit à l’époque du dernier Congrès de Calcutta sur le Hindi comme langue nationale. Il arrivait du Pandal, (lieu de réunion) du Congrès. Il rendit hommage avec chaleur au soin que les Anglais ont pris des langues indigènes. Son séjour en Angleterre malgré sa fâcheuse expérience des jurys anglais lui avait donné une foi profonde dans la démocratie anglaise et ce fut sérieusement qu’il fit cette extraordinaire suggestion de la faire connaître au Pendjab au moyen du cinématographe. Je raconte cet incident non parce que je partage sa foi, ce qui n’est point le cas, mais pour démontrer que Lokamanya n’avait pour les Anglais aucune haine. Mais il ne pouvait ni ne voulait admettre que l’Inde pût occuper un rang inférieur. Il voulait pour son pays une égalité absolue à laquelle celui-ci avait droit. Dans sa lutte pour la liberté, Lokamanya ne faisait pas quartier et n’en demandait point. J’espère que le
U||s Anglais reconnaîtront la valeur de l’homme que l’Inde adorait.
U||Les générations à venir le considéreront comme le Créateur de l’Inde Moderne. Elles vénèreront la mémoire de l’homme qui vécut et qui mourut pour elles. L’essence permanente de son être demeure à jamais parmi nous. Erigeons à l’unique Lokamanya de l’Inde un monument impérissable en tissant dans notre existence sa bravoure, sa simplicité, sa merveilleuse activité et son amour pour son pays.
U||Que Dieu accorde la paix à son âme!
U||[84] La situation était différente à Madras. M. Gandhi écrit dans la Jeune Inde du 29 septembre 1921 sous le titre: les Panchamas.
U||Nulle part les Intouchables ne sont aussi cruellement traités que dans la Présidence de Bombay. Leur seule ombre souille les Brahmanes. Ils n’ont même pas le droit de passer par les rues que ceux-ci fréquentent. Les Non-Brahmanes ne les traitent pas mieux. Entre les deux, les Panchamas, ainsi qu’on les appelle, sont écrasés complètement. Et cependant Madras est la ville des temples majestueux et de la dévotion. Avec leurs marques au front (Tilack), leurs longs cheveux bouclés et leur corps nu et propre les habitants ont l’air de Richis; mais dans ces signes extérieurs, leur religion semble s’être épuisée. Il est difficile de comprendre ce Dyerisme envers les citoyens les plus travailleurs et les plus utiles d’un pays qui a produit Shankara et Ramanaya. Et malgré le traitement satanique de nos frères dans cette partie de l’Inde, je conserve ma foi en ces peuples du sud. Je leur ai répété à toutes leurs immenses réunions, en termes qui ne laissaient aucun doute, que le Swaraj ne
U|| pourrait exister tant que cette malédiction subsisterait parmi nous.
U||Je leur ai dit que si nous étions considérés dans le monde entier presque comme des lépreux, c’était un juste retour pour avoir traité comme tels le cinquième de nos compatriotes. La Non-Coopération a pour but de transformer non seulement le cœur des Anglais mais aussi le nôtre. En vérité, j’attends ce changement de nous-mêmes d’abord, puis des Anglais ensuite inévitablement. Une nation qui est capable de rejeter un fléau existant depuis des siècles, une nation qui peut se débarrasser de l’habitude de boire comme on se débarrasse d’un vêtement, une nation qui peut se remettre à son industrie première et tout d’un coup utiliser ses heures de liberté et fabriquer pour 600 millions de roupies de tissus par an, cette nation est une nation régénérée et cette régénération doit réagir sur le monde entier. Elle doit être pour le railleur même une preuve convaincante de l’existence de Dieu et de sa Grâce. Aussi je dis que si l’Inde peut se transformer ainsi il n’est 
U||pas de pouvoir sur terre qui puisse nier le droit de l’Inde à établir le Swaraj.
U||Cette transformation ne peut s’obtenir par une action machinale et compliquée, mais elle peut avoir lieu si dans le cœur de chacun de nous s’opèrent des transformations merveilleuses. En tout cas, c’est le devoir de tout travailleur du Congrès de se montrer l’ami de son frère intouchable et d’intervenir auprès des Hindous, non-hindous afin de leur démontrer que l’Hindouisme des Vedas, des Upanishads, l’Hindouisme de la Bhagavadgita et de Shankara et de Ramanaja, ne renferme rien qui puisse nous autoriser à traiter d’intouchable un seul individu, si déchu soit-il. Que tout membre du Congrès intervienne le plus doucement possible auprès de l’orthodoxie et lui démontre que cette barrière sinistre est la négation même d’Ahimsa.
U||[85] Voir l’article sur l’Hindouisme.
U||[86] Tilak.
U||[87] Gandhi consacre plusieurs articles à ce sujet. Sous le titre «Pourquoi il faut brûler» il explique dans la Jeune Inde du 28 juillet 1921 les raisons pour lesquelles il est nécessaire que le tissu étranger soit détruit par le feu.—1o Il nous rappelle de pénibles souvenirs, il est un signe de notre déchéance, la Compagnie des Indes nous l’ayant imposé il est un symbole d’esclavage.—2o Il ne faut pas donner les vêtements confectionnés avec ce tissu aux pauvres, car ceux-ci ne doivent pas être insensibles au patriotisme, à la dignité et au respect. Et en somme, c’est faire d’un acte de renonciation un acte profitable qu’envoyer à Smyrne ou même à l’étranger tout tissu mis au rancart. Pourtant il y a moins d’objections au point de vue moral à l’envoyer à l’étranger qu’à l’utiliser dans notre pays.
U||Le 11 août paraissait dans la Jeune Inde ce qui suit.
U||Destruction par le feu à Bombay: Ceux qui auraient pu conserver quelques doutes sur la nécessité et sur la valeur pratique de la destruction par le feu des vêtements étrangers, et qui ont assisté à la cérémonie qui eut lieu à Parel dans la cour de Mr. Sobani, ont dû les perdre. Ce spectacle dont furent témoins des milliers de spectateurs fut des plus exaltants. Lorsque la flamme s’élança, enveloppant la pyramide tout entière, une clameur de joie retentit. Il semblait que les chaînes qui nous retenaient prisonniers venaient de se briser. Un souffle de liberté passa sur cette foule. Cet acte noble fut noblement accompli. Je suis persuadé que rien n’aurait pu produire une impression aussi forte sur l’imagination du peuple, au sujet du Swadeshi. Il valait beaucoup mieux que ce ne fussent pas des chiffons, mais les plus beaux saris, des chemises, des habits, qu’on eût livrés à la flamme. Je sais que les soies les plus précieuses que des mères conservaient pour le mariage de leurs fi
U||lles furent jetées au bûcher. La valeur de l’acte consistait à détruire des objets d’aussi grande valeur. Au moins un million et demi d’articles de prix furent brûlés dont certains valaient plusieurs centaines de roupies. Il eût été criminel de donner ces vêtements aux pauvres. Imaginez des indigents portant les plus riches soieries. C’eût été non seulement déplacé, mais anti-artistique. A vrai dire la plupart des objets détruits n’avaient aucun rapport avec l’existence des pauvres gens. Leur donner ces vêtements eût été aussi absurde que de leur offrir un somptueux service de toilette dont on ne se sert plus. J’espère que d’un bout à l’autre de l’Inde cette opération va continuer et qu’elle ne cessera que lorsque tout le tissu étranger aura été réduit en cendres ou expédié hors de l’Inde.
U||[88] Dans la Nava Jivan du 8 juin, Gandhi avait écrit un article sur les conditions du travail où il avait abordé la question ouvrière.
U||Deux voies, disait-il, sont aujourd’hui ouvertes à l’Inde: introduire le principe occidental que la force prime le droit, ou maintenir le principe oriental que, seule la Vérité l’emporte, ne connaît pas d’échec, et que le fort et le faible ont des droits égaux à la justice. Le mieux est de nous occuper d’abord de la classe ouvrière. En admettant que l’ouvrier puisse obtenir par la violence une augmentation de salaire, quelques justes que puissent être ses revendications, il faut qu’il s’en abstienne absolument. Employer la violence pour exiger son droit peut paraître facile, mais c’est en fin de compte un moyen hérissé de difficultés. Ceux qui vivent par les armes, périront par les armes. Il arrive souvent qu’un bon nageur se noie. Voyez l’Europe, personne ne paraît y être heureux, personne n’est satisfait. L’ouvrier se défie du capitaliste et le capitaliste n’a pas confiance dans l’ouvrier. Tous deux possèdent une certaine vigueur et une certaine force, mais c
U||e sont des qualités qui appartiennent même au taureau. Ils luttent tant qu’il y a moyen de lutter. Tout avancement n’est pas progrès. Rien ne nous prouve le progrès des peuples de l’Europe. Qu’ils soient prospères ne prouve nullement qu’ils sont riches en qualités morales et spirituelles.
U||Que faut-il donc faire? Les ouvriers de Bombay ont vaillamment résisté. Je n’ai pas été à même de connaître tous les faits, mais autant que j’ai pu voir ils auraient dû mieux s’y prendre. Il se peut que le propriétaire de la filature ait été dans son tort. Lorsqu’il s’agit d’un conflit entre le travail et le capitalisme, on peut dire neuf fois sur dix, que ce sont les capitalistes qui sont dans l’erreur. Mais je sais également que, lorsque l’ouvrier commence à se rendre compte de sa force, il peut devenir plus tyrannique que le capitaliste. Si les ouvriers pouvaient les dépasser en intelligence, les propriétaires des filatures se verraient contraints d’organiser le travail d’après les conditions qui leur seraient dictées. Mais il est certain que l’ouvrier n’arrivera jamais à cette intelligence, car alors il cesserait d’être ouvrier et deviendrait patron. Ce n’est pas uniquement l’argent qui fait la force des capitalistes. Ils possèdent véritablement de l’i
U||ntelligence et du tact.
U||La question qui se pose est donc celle-ci: Lorsque les ouvriers, tout en demeurant ce qu’ils sont, auront pris conscience d’eux-mêmes jusqu’à un certain point, quelle méthode devront-ils adopter? S’en rapporter à leur nombre ou à la force brutale c’est-à-dire à la violence serait un suicide de leur part. Ils nuiraient à l’industrie de leur pays. D’autre part s’ils se réclament de la justice et que pour l’obtenir ils souffrent dans leur personne, non seulement ils parviendront toujours au but, mais ils réformeront leurs maîtres et développeront l’industrie, les rapports des patrons et des ouvriers seront ceux des membres d’une même famille.
U||Pour résoudre d’une façon satisfaisante la question du travail il faut que les points suivants soient considérés:
U||1o Que les heures de travail laissent à l’ouvrier des heures de liberté.
U||2o Qu’il lui soit donné la possibilité de s’instruire.
U||3o Que des dispositions soient prises pour que ses enfants aient le lait et les vêtements nécessaires et pour qu’il puisse les instruire.
U||4o Que des logements salubres soient mis à sa disposition.
U||5o Que son gain soit suffisant pour lui permettre d’économiser pour ses vieux jours.
U||A l’heure actuelle, pas une de ces conditions n’est remplie. Et de cet état de choses patrons et ouvriers sont également responsables. Les patrons ne s’intéressent qu’au travail qui leur est fourni. Ils ne s’occupent point de ce que deviennent leurs ouvriers. Tous leurs efforts tendent à obtenir le maximum de travail pour le minimum de salaire. De son côté, l’ouvrier cherche à obtenir le maximum de salaire pour le minimum de travail. D’où il résulte que même lorsque les ouvriers obtiennent une augmentation, la production n’en est pas plus élevée. Les rapports entre les deux intéressés ne sont pas épurés et les ouvriers ne font pas le meilleur usage des augmentations qu’ils ont obtenues.
U||Entre les patrons et les ouvriers, un troisième parti est venu s’interposer. Il est devenu l’ami de l’ouvrier, mais il ne peut être utile à ce dernier que si son amitié est désintéressée.
U||Le moment est venu où l’on va se servir de diverses façons de la question du travail comme d’un gage. Elle demande de la réflexion de la part de ceux qui voudraient faire de la politique. Que vont-ils choisir? leur propre intérêt ou celui de l’ouvrier et de la nation? L’ouvrier a grand besoin d’amis. Il faut qu’il soit dirigé pour progresser. La condition du travail dépendra de ceux qui se mettront à sa tête.
U||Les grèves, l’interruption du travail, les «hartals» sont des choses fort bonnes sans doute, mais dont il est facile d’abuser. Il faut que les ouvriers s’organisent en solides unions ouvrières et qu’en aucune circonstance ils ne fassent grève sans l’autorisation de ces unions. Il ne faut pas courir le risque d’une grève, sans que des tentatives de négociation aient été faites tout d’abord auprès des propriétaires des filatures. Si ces derniers ont recours à l’arbitrage le principe du Panchayat doit être accepté et le Panch nommé. La décision de ce jury doit être approuvée des deux intéressés qu’elle leur plaise ou non.
U||Lecteurs, si vous souhaitez l’amélioration des conditions du travail, si vous voulez aider l’ouvrier et vous montrer son ami, vous verrez par ce qui précède qu’il n’y a qu’un seul moyen d’y arriver, c’est de l’élever en créant entre son patron et lui des relations familiales. Il n’est pas de meilleure route que celle de la Vérité. Une simple augmentation de salaire ne doit pas vous satisfaire, il faut veiller également à la façon dont les ouvriers obtiendront cette augmentation et à l’usage qu’ils en feront.
U||[89] Dans son article du 13 octobre 1920, M. Gandhi explique ce mot à propos de la question du Célibat. Nous reproduisons ci-dessous cet article qui a pour titre «En Confidence».
U||Je reçois un si grand nombre de lettres m’interrogeant sur la question du célibat qu’il m’est impossible, ayant à ce sujet des opinions très précises, et surtout à cette époque critique de notre existence nationale, de remettre à un autre moment de dire ce que j’en pense et les conclusions que m’a dictées l’expérience.
U||Le mot sanscrit qui correspond à célibat est Brahmacharya et il signifie beaucoup plus que célibat. Brahmacharya veut dire contrôle absolu de tous les sens et de tous les organes. Rien n’est impossible à un Brahmachari. Mais c’est un état idéal rarement réalisé. C’est presque la ligne d’Euclide, qui n’existe que dans l’imagination, qu’on ne peut jamais tracer en réalité et qui n’en est pas moins une importante définition de la géométrie donnant de grands résultats. Un Brahmachari parfait peut donc n’exister qu’en imagination, mais si nous ne l’avions constamment devant les yeux nous serions comme un navire sans gouvernail. Plus nous approchons de cet état imaginaire, plus notre perfection est grande.
U||Pour l’instant j’ai l’intention de me borner à Brahmacharya pris dans le sens de célibat. Je considère qu’une existence absolument chaste en pensée, en parole et en action est tout à fait indispensable pour atteindre à la perfection spirituelle. La nation qui ne possède pas d’hommes capables de mener cette existence en est d’autant plus pauvre. Mais mon but est de démontrer la nécessité temporaire de Brahmacharya à l’époque actuelle de notre existence nationale.
U||Nous avons plus que notre part de maladies, de famines, et de misère, et même plusieurs millions des nôtres meurent de faim. Nous sommes annihilés par l’esclavage et d’une façon si subtile que beaucoup d’entre nous se refusent à l’admettre et s’imaginent à tort, malgré le triple fléau de l’épuisement économique, mental et spirituel que notre liberté s’accroît progressivement. Les dépenses toujours plus élevées pour l’armée, la politique fiscale préjudiciable aux intérêts du pays et ne cherchant que le bien du Lancashire et autres intérêts britanniques, la prodigalité extravagante avec laquelle sont organisés les divers services de l’administration demandent à l’Inde une si lourde contribution que sa pauvreté s’en trouve accrue et ses forces de résistance à la maladie diminuées. La façon d’administrer, a, pour employer les paroles de Gokhale, «rabougri» la nation à tel point que les plus grands d’entre nous sommes forcés de nous courber...
U||Est-il juste que nous qui connaissons la situation, mettions des enfants au monde dans une atmosphère aussi dégradante? Si nous continuons à procréer alors que nous sommes impuissants, malades et mourants de faim, nous ne ferons que multiplier des esclaves et des êtres faibles. Tant que l’Inde ne sera pas devenue nation libre, capable de résister à la sous-alimentation et d’y porter remède, capable de se nourrir pendant les famines, capable de guérir la fièvre paludéenne, le choléra, l’influenza et autres épidémies, nous n’avons pas le droit de mettre au monde des enfants. Je ne puis cacher au lecteur quel chagrin j’éprouve lorsque j’entends parler de naissances sur notre terre indienne. Je dois dire que depuis des années je réfléchis avec satisfaction à la possibilité de suspendre la procréation par la continence.—L’Inde est actuellement mal équipée pour prendre soin même de sa population présente, non parce que celle-ci est trop nombreuse mais parce qu’il lui faut
U|| subir une domination étrangère qui a pour doctrine d’en exploiter progressivement toutes les ressources.
U||Comment arrêter la procréation? Non par les méthodes immorales et artificielles employées en Europe, mais par une vie de discipline et de maîtrise de soi. Il faut que les parents enseignent à leurs enfants les principes de «Brahmacharya». D’après les Shastras hindous l’âge le plus bas pour le mariage des jeunes gens est de vingt-cinq ans. Si l’on pouvait arriver à persuader aux mères qu’il est criminel d’élever les garçons et les filles en vue du mariage, la moitié des mariages cesseraient automatiquement. Nous ne devons pas croire que ce fétiche de la puberté précoce chez nos filles est dû à notre climat chaud. Je n’ai jamais connu de superstition plus grossière et je prétends que le climat n’a absolument rien à voir avec la puberté. Cette puberté prématurée est amenée par l’atmosphère morale et mentale de notre vie de famille. Les mères et autres membres de la famille se font un devoir religieux d’apprendre à des enfants innocentes qu’on les mariera dès q
U||u’elles auront atteint un certain moment, et on les fiance dès le bas âge, avant même qu’elles sachent marcher. La façon d’habiller les enfants et de les nourrir concourt également à exciter leurs passions. Nous habillons nos enfants comme des poupées, non pour leur plaisir mais pour satisfaire notre vanité. J’ai élevé des douzaines d’enfants. Ils portaient avec plaisir et sans aucune difficulté n’importe quel genre de vêtements.—Nous leur donnons toute sorte de nourritures échauffantes et excitantes. Notre amour aveugle ne tient aucun compte de ce qu’ils peuvent supporter. Il en résulte naturellement une adolescence précoce, des maternités prématurées et la mort bien avant l’heure. Les parents donnent à leurs enfants une leçon de choses qu’ils ne sont pas longs à comprendre. En satisfaisant leurs passions avec insouciance ils offrent à leurs enfants l’exemple d’une licence déréglée. Toute addition prématurée à la famille est accueillie par des fanfares joy
U||euses et des réjouissances. Ce qu’il y a de surprenant, c’est qu’étant donnée l’atmosphère qui nous entoure notre licence ne soit pas plus grande. Je ne doute pas que si les gens mariés veulent voir l’Inde devenir une nation d’hommes et de femmes solides, vigoureux et bien faits, ils doivent être absolument chastes et cesser pour l’instant de procréer. Je donne ce conseil même aux jeunes mariés. Il est plus facile de ne jamais faire une chose, que de cesser de la faire, de même qu’il est plus facile pour qui n’a jamais bu de continuer à être sobre qu’à un ivrogne de le devenir. Rester debout est infiniment plus facile que se relever après une chute. Il est faux de dire qu’on ne peut prêcher avec succès la continence qu’à ceux qui sont blasés. Il est également absurde de prêcher la continence à un être affaibli. Ce que je veux démontrer c’est que jeunes ou vieux, blasés ou non, il est de notre devoir, à l’époque actuelle, de cesser de donner naissance à d
U||es êtres qui hériteront de notre esclavage.
U||Puis-je mettre en garde les parents contre le piège de l’argument basé sur les droits des conjoints? Le consentement du conjoint est nécessaire pour satisfaire nos passions, mais jamais pour les réprimer.
U||Au moment où nous sommes engagés dans une lutte à mort contre un gouvernement puissant, nous avons besoin de toutes les forces physiques, matérielles, morales et spirituelles que nous pourrons acquérir et nous n’y parviendrons qu’en ménageant ce que nous devons mettre au-dessus de tout. Si nous n’atteignons pas cette pureté de vie individuelle, nous demeurerons toujours une nation esclave. Ne nous leurrons pas en nous imaginant que parce que nous considérons le gouvernement anglais comme corrompu, les Anglais seraient incapables de nous distancer dans la course à la vertu individuelle. Sans faire parade spirituelle des vertus fondamentales, ils les pratiquent abondamment au point de vue physique, en tout cas. Parmi ceux qui s’occupent de la politique du pays il y a plus de célibataires, hommes et femmes, que parmi nous. La femme célibataire n’existe pour ainsi dire pas aux Indes, sauf les nonnes qui n’exercent aucune influence sur la politique du pays, alors qu’en Europe pour des mil
U||liers de femmes le célibat est une vertu courante.

U||[92] Corruption du Loyalisme.
U||«Son Excellence le Gouverneur de Bombay a prévenu le public il y a quelque temps qu’il «allait agir», qu’il ne tolèrerait pas certains discours. Il ne laissait subsister aucun doute dans l’allusion qu’il fit aux frères Ali et autres sur ce qu’il entendait par là. Les frères Ali seront accusés d’avoir corrompu le loyalisme du cipaye et d’avoir tenu des propos séditieux. Je dois avouer que je ne m’attendais pas à une preuve d’ignorance aussi grande de la part du Gouverneur de Bombay. Il est évident que pendant les douze derniers mois il n’a pas suivi l’histoire de l’Inde. Il ignore évidemment que le Congrès National commença à corrompre le loyalisme du cipaye en Septembre l’année dernière, que le Comité Central pour le Califat commença encore plus tôt, car je tiens à réclamer l’honneur ou l’horreur d’avoir suggéré le droit de l’Inde à dire ouvertement au cipaye et à tous ceux qui sont au service du Gouvernement, qu’ils participent au mal accompli p
U||ar ce gouvernement. La Conférence de Karachi ne fit que répéter dans la langue de l’Islam la déclaration du Congrès; mais au nom de l’Hindouisme et au nom du Nationalisme, je n’ai aucune hésitation à déclarer qu’il est mal de la part de n’importe qui, soldat ou civil, de servir un gouvernement déloyal envers les Musulmans de l’Inde et coupable d’actes inhumains au Pendjab. Je l’ai répété du haut de mainte estrade devant les cipayes, et si je ne leur ai pas demandé d’abandonner leur métier, ce n’est certainement pas que le désir m’en ait manqué mais parce qu’il m’était impossible de les aider à vivre. Je n’ai pas hésité à dire au cipaye que s’il pouvait quitter le service et vivre sans le secours du Congrès ou du Califat, il devrait le faire immédiatement. Je puis assurer que dès que le rouet aura trouvé sa place dans chaque intérieur, dès que les Indiens auront commencé à se rendre compte que tisser peut procurer à n’importe qui et à n’importe 
U||quel moment un moyen d’existence honorable, je n’hésiterai pas à demander individuellement à chaque cipaye (même si l’on devait me fusiller) de quitter l’armée et de se mettre à filer. Car n’a-t-on pas habitué le cipaye à tenir ses semblables sous le joug, ne s’est-on pas servi de lui pour tuer les innocents du Jallianwala Bagh, ne s’est-on pas servi de lui pour chasser des hommes, des femmes et des enfants innocents pendant cette horrible nuit à Chandpur, ne s’est-on pas servi de lui pour forcer les fiers Arabes de la Mésopotamie à se soumettre, ne s’est-on pas servi de lui pour écraser les Egyptiens? Comment un seul Indien ayant en lui une étincelle d’humanité et un seul Musulman fier de sa religion pourraient-ils avoir d’autres sentiments que ceux des frères Ali? On s’est beaucoup plus servi du cipaye comme assassin rétribué que comme soldat pour défendre la liberté et l’honneur des faibles ou des êtres sans défense...
U||Nous ne demandons pas de quartier, nous n’en attendons pas de la part du gouvernement. Nous n’avons pas demandé qu’on nous promette d’être exemptés de la prison, tant que nous serions non-violents. Nous avons à continuer d’avancer. Nous devons du haut de mille estrades répéter les paroles des frères Ali au sujet des cipayes, et ouvertement et systématiquement continuer à répandre la désaffection, jusqu’à ce qu’il plaise au Gouvernement de nous arrêter. Et nous agirons ainsi, non par vengeance haineuse, mais parce que c’est notre Dharma.
U||Une Enigme et sa solution.
U||Lord Reading est intrigué et perplexe. Son Excellence, répondant à des discours de l’Association Anglo-Indienne et de la Chambre de Commerce du Bengale et de celle de Calcutta, a dit: «J’avoue que lorsque je considère l’activité d’un certain groupe de la communauté, je reste, (et cela malgré les efforts que je fais pour comprendre depuis que je suis dans l’Inde,) intrigué et perplexe. Je me demande à quoi peut servir de braver le gouvernement, afin de le forcer à vous arrêter.» Nous voulons qu’on nous arrête, parce que ce qu’il est habituel d’appeler liberté n’est que de l’esclavage. Nous jetons un défi au pouvoir du gouvernement, parce que nous considérons son activité comme absolument malfaisante. Nous voulons renverser le gouvernement, nous voulons l’obliger à se soumettre à la volonté du peuple. Nous voulons démontrer que le gouvernement est là pour servir le peuple, et non le peuple pour servir le gouvernement. La liberté sous le gouvernement est devenue int
U||olérable, car le prix réclamé pour la conserver est absolument déraisonnable. Que nous soyons seul ou plusieurs, nous devons refuser une liberté qui nous condamne aux dépens de notre respect de nous-mêmes, et des convictions qui nous sont si chères.
U||Il faut que Lord Reading comprenne clairement que les Non-Coopérateurs sont en guerre contre le gouvernement. Ils se sont révoltés contre lui, parce que celui-ci a manqué à la parole donnée aux Musulmans, qu’il a humilié le Pendjab et qu’il cherche à imposer sa volonté au peuple et refuse de réparer les injustices dont le Pendjab a souffert.
U||Il y avait deux moyens d’agir: une rébellion armée ou une révolte pacifique. Les Non-Coopérateurs ont préféré, certains par faiblesse, d’autres parce qu’ils se sentent forts, la méthode pacifique, c’est-à-dire la souffrance volontaire. Lord Reading qui a été élevé dans l’atmosphère des tribunaux peut difficilement apprécier la résistance pacifique à l’autorité. Son Excellence aura appris avant la fin du conflit qu’il existe un tribunal bien supérieur aux tribunaux judiciaires: c’est le tribunal de notre conscience. Il surpasse tous les autres.
U||Lord Reading peut, s’il le désire, considérer tous ceux qui souffrent, comme des fous qui ignorent leur intérêt. Il a donc le droit de les mettre à l’abri du mal. C’est un arrangement qui convient admirablement aux fous, et si celui-ci plaît au gouvernement, une position idéale. Il aura sujet de se plaindre, si après avoir cherché à se faire mettre en prison, les Non-Coopérateurs ne sont pas contents et se plaignent, s’ils grognent et glapissent, afin d’obtenir des faveurs, comme dit Lalaji. La force du Non-Coopérateur consiste à aller en prison sans se plaindre. Il perd sa cause si, après avoir cherché à se faire emprisonner, il se plaint dès que la prison lui ouvre les bras. Les menaces de Son Excellence manquent de dignité. Il y a conflit entre le règne de la violence et l’opinion publique. Ceux qui la représentent sont résolus à subir n’importe quelle violence plutôt que de renoncer à leur opinion.
U||Secouant la crinière.
U||«Comment pourra-t-il y avoir entente tant que le lion britannique continue à brandir à notre face ses griffes souillées de sang? Lord Birkenhead nous rappelle que l’Angleterre n’a rien perdu de ses muscles solides, Mr. Montague nous déclare de la façon la plus catégorique que les Anglais appartiennent à la nation la plus résolue de la terre et qu’ils ne supporteront pas d’obstacles à leurs desseins. Permettez-moi de citer textuellement le texte du télégramme de Reuter:
U||«Si l’existence de Notre Empire se trouvait menacée, si le Gouvernement Britannique se trouvait empêché d’accomplir ses fonctions, si certaines demandes lui étaient adressées avec la fausse conviction que nous avons l’intention de quitter l’Inde, l’Inde ne réussirait point, par sa provocation au peuple le plus résolu du monde car celui-ci répondrait à cette provocation avec toute la vigueur et la détermination dont il dispose».
U||Lord Birkenhead et Mr. Montague semblent ignorer l’un et l’autre que l’Inde est prête à tenir tête à tous les muscles solides que l’on pourrait envoyer au-delà des mers, et que son défi fut lancé à Calcutta en 1920, lorsque l’Inde déclara ne pouvoir se contenter de moins que du Swaraj et de la réparation complète des torts faits au Pendjab et au Califat. Il s’agit en effet de l’existence de l’Empire, et si ceux qui en ont la responsabilité n’acceptent point sa transformation pacifique en véritable fédération de nations, possédant chacune des droits égaux et la possibilité de se détacher si elles le désirent d’une association amicale et honorable, toute la détermination et toute la vigueur «du peuple le plus résolu du monde» et tous les «muscles solides» seront en vain employés pour briser l’esprit qui a pris naissance et qui ne saurait ni plier ni se briser. Il est exact que nous ne possédons pas de «muscles solides». Les misérables millions d’Indiens qu
U||i se nourrissent de riz semblent résolus à accomplir leur destinée sans autre tutelle et sans armes. Selon le mot de Lockamanya, «c’est leur droit de naissance», et ils y parviendront, malgré tous les muscles solides, malgré toute la vigueur et la détermination avec laquelle on peut les gouverner. L’Inde ne peut pas et ne veut pas répondre à cette insolence par l’insolence. Mais si elle demeure fidèle à son serment, la prière qu’elle adresse à Dieu pour qu’il la délivre ne sera pas vaine. Aucun Empire grisé du vin rouge du pouvoir ou du pillage des races plus faibles n’a jamais duré longtemps, et l’Empire britannique qui est fondé sur l’exploitation systématique des races physiquement plus faibles et sur une démonstration continuelle de force brutale, ne peut durer si un Dieu juste est le maître de l’univers. Ces soi-disant représentants de la nation Britannique semblent bien peu se rendre compte que l’Inde a déjà exposé aux «muscles solides» un grand nombre de 
U||ses hommes les plus nobles. Si Chauri-Chaura n’avait pas interrompu le cours régulier du sacrifice national, il y aurait eu des offrandes plus délectables encore faites au lion. Mais Dieu en avait décidé autrement. Rien n’empêche cependant tous les représentants de Downing Street et de Whitehall de faire ce qui leur plaît. J’ai conscience d’avoir écrit avec un peu d’emportement, au sujet de la menace qui nous vient d’outre-mer; mais il est temps que le peuple Britannique se rende compte que la lutte commencée en 1920 continuera jusqu’au bout, qu’elle dure un mois, un an, plusieurs mois ou plusieurs années, et même si les représentants de la Grande-Bretagne recouraient aux orgies innommables de l’époque de la «Rébellion». J’espère simplement et je prie Dieu qu’il rendra l’Inde assez forte et assez humble pour pouvoir demeurer non-violente jusqu’au bout. Il est impossible à présent d’accepter les défis insolents qui nous sont adressés par dépêche.

U||1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
U||1.E.1.

U||    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

U||1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
U||1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying, performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

U||    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.”
U||    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™ License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™ works.
U||    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of receipt of the work.
U||    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
U||1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
U||1.F.
U||1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
U||1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
U||1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.
U||1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
U||1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
U||1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
U||Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
U||Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
U||Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
U||Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
U||The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
U||The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
U||Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
U||Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
U||The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

U||I. INTRODUCTION
U||After the great war it is difficult, to point out a single nation that is happy; but this has come out of the war, that there is not a single nation outside India, that is not either free or striving to be free.
U||It is said that we, too, are on the road to freedom, that it is better to be on the certain though slow course of gradual unfoldment of freedom than to take the troubled and dangerous path of revolution whether peaceful or violent, and that the new Reforms are a half-way house to freedom.
U||The new constitution granted to India keeps all the military forces, both in the direction and in the financial control, entirely outside the scope of responsibility to the people of India. What does this mean? It means that the revenues of India are spent away on what the nation does not want. But after the mid-Eastern complications and the fresh Asiatic additions to British Imperial spheres of action. This Indian military servitude is a clear danger to national interests.
U||The new constitution gives no scope for retrenchment and therefore no scope for measures of social reform except by fresh taxation, the heavy burden of which on the poor will outweigh all the advantages of any reforms. It maintains all the existing foreign services, and the cost of the administrative machinery high as it already is, is further increased.
U||The reformed constitution keeps all the fundamental liberties of person, property, press, and association completely under bureaucratic control. All those laws which give to the irresponsible officers of the Executive Government of India absolute powers to override the popular will, are still unrepealed. In spite of the tragic price paid in the Punjab for demonstrating the danger of unrestrained power in the hands of a foreign bureaucracy and the inhumanity of spirit by which tyranny in a panic will seek to save itself, we stand just where we were before, at the mercy of the Executive in respect of all our fundamental liberties.
U||Not only is Despotism intact in the Law, but unparalleled crimes and cruelties against the people have been encouraged and even after boastful admissions and clearest proofs, left unpunished. The spirit of unrepentant cruelty has thus been allowed to permeate the whole administration.
U||THE MUSSALMAN AGONY
U||To understand our present condition it is not enough to realise the general political servitude. We should add to it the reality and the extent of the injury inflicted by Britain on Islam, and thereby on the Mussalmans of India. The articles of Islamic faith which it is necessary to understand in order to realise why Mussalman India, which was once so loyal is now so strongly moved to the contrary are easily set out and understood. Every religion should be interpreted by the professors of that religion. The sentiments and religious ideas of Muslims founded on the traditions of long generations cannot be altered now by logic or cosmopolitanism, as others understand it. Such an attempt is the more unreasonable when it is made not even as a bonafide and independent effort of proselytising logic or reason, but only to justify a treaty entered into for political and worldly purposes.
U||The Khalifa is the authority that is entrusted with the duty of defending Islam. He is the successor to Muhammad and the agent of God on earth. According to Islamic tradition he must possess sufficient temporal power effectively to protect Islam against non-Islamic powers and he should be one elected or accepted by the Mussalman world.
U||The Jazirat-ul-Arab is the area bounded by the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the waters of the Tigris and the Euphrates. It is the sacred Home of Islam and the centre towards which Islam throughout the world turns in prayer. According to the religious injunctions of the Mussalmans, this entire area should always be under Muslim control, its scientific border being believed to be a protection for the integrity of Islamic life and faith. Every Mussalman throughout the world is enjoined to sacrifice his all, if necessary, for preserving the Jazirat-ul-Arab under complete Muslim control.
U||The sacred places of Islam should be in the possession of the Khalifa. They should not merely be free for the entry of the Mussalmans of the world by the grace or the license of non-Muslim powers, but should be the possession and property of Islam in the fullest degree.
U||It is a religions obligation, on every Mussalman to go forth and help the Khalifa in every possible way where his unaided efforts in the defence of the Khilifat have failed.
U||The grievance of the Indian Mussalmans is that a government that pretends to protect and spread peace and happiness among them has no right to ignore or set aside these articles of their cherished faith.
U||According to the Peace Treaty imposed on the nominal Government at Constantinople, the Khalifa far from having the temporal authority or power needed to protect Islam, is a prisoner in his own city. He is to have no real fighting force, army or navy, and the financial control over his own territories is vested in other Governments. His capital is cut off from the rest of his possessions by an intervening permanent military occupation. It is needless to say that under these conditions he is absolutely incapable of protecting Islam as the Mussulmans of the world understand it.
U||The Jazirat-ul-Arab is split up; a great part of it given to powerful non-Muslim Powers, the remnant left with petty chiefs dominated all round by non-Muslim Governments.
U||The Holy places of Islam are all taken out of the Khalifa’s kingdom, some left in the possession of minor Muslim chiefs of Arabia entirely dependent on European control, and some relegated to newly-formed non-Muslim states.
U||In a word, the Mussalman’s free choice of a Khalifa such as Islamic tradition defines is made an unreality.
U||THE HINDU DHARMA
U||The age of misunderstanding and mutual warfare among religions is gone. If India has a mission of its own to the world, it is to establish the unity and the truth of all religions. This unity is established by mutual help and understanding between the various religions. It has come as a rare privilege to the Hindus in the fulfilment of this mission of India to stand up in defence of Islam against the onslaught of the earth-greed of the military powers of the west.
U||The Dharma of Hinduism in this respect is placed beyond all doubt by the Bhagavat Gita.
U||Those who are the votaries of other Gods and worship them with faith—even they, O Kaunteya, worship me alone, though not as the Shastra requires—IX, 23.
U||Whoever being devoted wishes in perfect faith to worship a particular form, of such a one I maintain the same faith unshaken,—VII 21.
U||Hinduism will realise its fullest beauty when in the fulfilment of this cardinal tenet, its followers offer themselves as sacrifice for the protection of the faith of their brothers, the Mussalmans.
U||If Hindus and Mussalmans attain the height of courage and sacrifice that is needed for this battle on behalf of Islam against the greed of the West, a victory will be won not alone for Islam, but for Christianity itself. Militarism has robbed the crucified God of his name and his very cross and the World has been mistaking it to be Christianity. After the battle of Islam is won, Islam and Hinduism together can emancipate Christianity itself from the lust for power and wealth which have strangled it now and the true Christianity of the Gospels will be established. This battle of non-cooperation with its suffering and peaceful withdrawal of service will once for all establish its superiority over the power of brute force and unlimited slaughter.
U||What a glorious privilege it is to play our part in this history of the world, when Hinduism and Christianity will unite on behalf of Islam, and in that strife of mutual love and support each religion will attain its own truest shape and beauty.
U||AN ENDURING TREATY
U||Swaraj for India has two great problems, one internal and the other external. How can Hindus and Mussalmans so different from each other form a strong and united nation governing themselves peacefully? This was the question for years, and no one could believe that the two communities could suffer for each other till the miracle was actually worked. The Khilafat has solved the problem. By the magic of suffering, each has truly touched and captured the other’s heart, and the Nation now is strong and united.
U||Not internal strength and unity alone has the Khilafat brought to India. The great block in the way of Indian aspiration for full freedom was the problem of external defence. How is India, left to herself defend her frontiers against her Mussalman neighbours? None but emasculated nations would accept such difficulties and responsibilities as an answer to the demand for freedom. It is only a people whose mentality has been perverted that can soothe itself with the domination by one race from a distant country, as a preventative against the aggression of another, a permanent and natural neighbour. Instead of developing strength to protect ourselves against those near whom we are permanently placed, a feeling of incurable impotence has been generated. Two strong and brave nations can live side by side, strengthening each other through enforcing constant vigilance, and maintain in full vigour each its own national strength, unity, patriotism and resources. If a nation wishes to be respected by its neighbours it 
U||has to develop and enter into honourable treaties. These are the only natural conditions of national liberty; but not a surrender to distant military powers to save oneself from one’s neighbours.
U||The Khilafat has solved the problem of distrust of Asiatic neighbours out of our future. The Indian struggle for the freedom of Islam has brought about a more lasting entente and a more binding treaty between the people of India and the people of the Mussalman states around it than all the ententes and treaties among the Governments of Europe. No wars of aggression are possible where the common people on the two sides have become grateful friends. The faith of the Mussulman is a better sanction than the seal of the European Diplomats and plenipotentiaries. Not only has this great friendship between India and the Mussulman States around it removed for all time the fear of Mussulman aggression from outside, but it has erected round India, a solid wall of defence against all aggression from beyond against all greed from Europe, Russia or elsewhere. No secret diplomacy could establish a better entente or a stronger federation than what this open and non-governmental treaty between Islam and India has established
U||. The Indian support of the Khilafat has, as if by a magic wand, converted what Was once the Pan-Islamic terror for Europe into a solid wall of friendship and defence for India.
U||THE BRITISH CONNECTION
U||Every nation like every individual is born free. Absolute freedom is the birthright of every people. The only limitations are those which a people may place over themselves. The British connection is invaluable as long as it is a defence against any worse connection sought to be imposed by violence. But it is only a means to an end, not a mandate of Providence of Nature. The alliance of neighbours, born of suffering for each other’s sake, for ends that purify those that suffer, is necessarily a more natural and more enduring bond than one that has resulted from pure greed on the one side and weakness on the other. Where such a natural and enduring alliance has been accomplished among Asiatic peoples and not only between the respective governments, it may truly be felt to be more valuable than the British connection itself, after that connection has denied freedom or equality, and even justice.
U||THE ALTERNATIVE
U||Is violence or total surrender the only choice open to any people to whom Freedom or Justice is denied? Violence at a time when the whole world has learnt from bitter experience the futility of violence is unworthy of a country whose ancient people’s privilege, it was, to see this truth long ago.
U||Violence may rid a nation of its foreign masters but will only enslave it from inside. No nation can really be free which is at the mercy of its army and its military heroes. If a people rely for freedom on its soldiers, the soldiers will rule the country, not the people. Till the recent awakening of the workers of Europe, this was the only freedom which the powers of Europe really enjoyed. True freedom can exist only when those who produce, not those who destroy or know only to live on other’s labour, are the masters.
U||Even were violence the true road to freedom, is violence possible to a nation which has been emasculated and deprived of all weapons, and the whole world is hopelessly in advance of all our possibilities in the manufacture and the wielding of weapons of destruction.
U||Submission or withdrawal of co-operation is the real and only alternative before India. Submission to injustice puts on the tempting garb of peace and, gradual progress, but there is no surer way to death than submission to wrong.
U||THE FIFTH UPAYA
U||Our ancients classified the arts of conquest into four well-known Upayas. Sama, Dana, Uheda, and Danda. A fifth Upuya was recognised sometimes by our ancients, which they called Upeshka. It is this Punchamopaya that is placed by Mahatma Gandhi before the people of India in the form of Non-cooperation as an alternative, besides violence, to surrender.
U||Where in any case negotiations have failed and the enemy is neither corruptible nor incapable of being divided, and a resort to violence has failed or would certainly be futile the method of Upeshka remains to be applied to the case. Indeed, when the very existence of the power we seek to defeat really depends on our continuous co-operation with it, and where our Upeskha its very life, our Upeskha or non-co-operation is the most natural and most effective expedient that we can employ to bend it to our will.
U||No Englishman believes that his nation can rule or keep India for a day unless the people of India actively co-operate to maintain that rule. Whether the co-operation be given willingly or through ignorance, cupidity, habit or fear, the withdrawal of that co-operation means impossibility of foreign rule in India. Some of us may not realise this, but those who govern us have long ago known and are now keenly alive to this truth. The active assistance of the people of this country in the supply of the money, men, and knowledge of the languages, customs and laws of the land, is the main-spring of the continuous life of the foreign administration. Indeed the circumstances of British rule in this country are such that but for a double supply of co-operation on the part of the governed, it must have broken down long ago. Any system of race domination is unnatural, and can be kept up only by active coercion through a foreign-recruited public, service invested with large powers, however much it may be helped by the 
U||perversion of mentality shaping the education of the youth of the country. The foreign recruited service must necessarily be very highly paid. This creates a wrong standard for the Indian recruited officials also. Military expenditure has to cover not only the needs of defence against foreign aggression, but also the possibilities of internal unrest and rebellion. Police charges have to go beyond the prevention and deletion of ordinary crime, for though this would be the only expenditure over the police of a self-governing people where any nation governs anther, a large chapter of artificial crime has to be added to the penal code, and the work of the police extended accordingly. The military and public organisations must also be such as not only to result in outside efficiency, but also at the same time guarantee internal impotency. This is to be achieved by the adjustment and careful admixture of officers and units from different races. All this can be and is maintained only by extra cost and extra-active 
U||co-operation on the part of the people. The slightest withdrawal of assistance must put such machinery out of gear. This is the basis of the programme of progressive non violent non-co-operation that has been adopted by the National Congress.
U||SOME OBJECTIONS
U||The powerful character of the measure, however, leads some to object to non-co-operation because of that very reason. Striking as it does at the very root of Government in India, they fear that non-co-operation must lead to anarchy, and that the remedy is worse than the disease. This is an objection arising out of insufficient allowance for human nature. It is assumed that the British people will allow their connection with India to cease rather than remedy the wrongs for which we seek justice. If this assumption be correct, no doubt it must lead to separation and possibly also anarchy for a time. If the operatives in a factory have grievances, negotiations having failed, a strike would on a similar argument be never admissible. Unyielding obstinacy being presumed, it must end in the closing down of the factory and break up of the men. But if in ninety-nine out of a hundred cases it is not the case that strikes end in this manner, it is more unlikely that, instead of righting the manifest wrongs that India c
U||omplains about, the British people will value their Indian Dominion so low as to prefer to allow us to non-co-operate up to the point of separation. It would be a totally false reading of British character and British history. But if such wicked obstinacy be ultimately shown by a government, far be it from us to prefer peace at the price of abject surrender to wrong. There is no anarchy greater than the moral anarchy of surrender to unrepentant wrong. We may, however, be certain that if we show the strength and unity necessary for non-co-operation, long before we progress with it far, we shall have developed true order and true self-government wherein there is no place for anarchy.
U||Another fear sometimes expressed that, if non-co-operation were to succeed, the British would have to go, leaving us unable to defend ourselves against foreign aggression. If we have the self-respect, the patriotism, the tenacious purpose, and the power of organisation that are necessary to drive the British out from their entrenched position, no lesser foreign power will dare after that, undertake the futile task of conquering or enslaving us.
U||It is sometimes said that non-co-operation is negative and destructive of the advantages which a stable government has conferred on us. That non-co-operation is negative is merely a half-truth. Non-co-operation with the government means greater co-operation among ourselves, greater mutual dependence among the many different castes and classes of our country. Non-co-operation is not mere negation. It will lead to the recovery of the lost art of co-operation among ourselves. Long dependence on an outside government which by its interference suppressed or prevented the consequences of our differences has made us forget the duty of mutual trust and the art of friendly adjustment. Having allowed Government to do everything for us, we have gradually become incapable of doing anything for ourselves. Even if we had no grievance against this Government, non-co-operation with it for a time would be desirable so far as it would perforce lead us to trusting and working with one another and thereby strengthen the bonds o
U||f national unity.
U||The most tragic consequence of dependence on the complex machinery of a foreign government is the atrophy of the communal sense. The direct touch with administrative cause and effect is lost. An outside protector performs all the necessary functions of the community in a mysterious manner, and communal duties are not realised by the people. The one reason addressed by those who deny to us the capacity for self-rule is the insufficient appreciation by the people of communal duties and discipline. It is only by actually refraining for a time from dependence on Government that we can regain self-reliance, learn first-hand the value of communal duties and build up true national co-operation. Non-co-operation is a practical and positive training in Swadharma, and Swadharma alone can lead up to Swaraj.
U||The negative is the best and most impressive method of enforcing the value of the positive. Few outside government circles realise in the present police anything but tyranny and corruption. But if the units of the present police were withdrawn we would soon perforce set about organising a substitute, and most people would realise the true social value of a police force. Few realise in the present taxes anything but coercion and waste, but most people would soon see that a share of every man’s income is due for common purposes and that there are many limitations to the economical management of public institutions; we would begin once again to contribute directly, build up and maintain national institutions in the place of those that now mysteriously spring up and live under Government orders.
U||EMANCIPATION
U||Freedom is a priceless thing. But it is a stable possession only when it is acquired by a nation’s strenuous effort. What is not by chance or outward circumstance, or given by the generous impulse of a tyrant prince or people is not a reality. A nation will truly enjoy freedom only when in the process of winning or defending its freedom, it has been purified and consolidated through and through, until liberty has become a part of its very soul. Otherwise it would be but a change of the form of government, which might please the fancy of politicians, or satisfy the classes in power, but could never emancipate a people. An Act of Parliament can never create citizens in Hindustan. The strength, spirit, and happiness of a people who have fought and won their liberty cannot be got by Reform Acts. Effort and sacrifice are the necessary conditions of real stable emancipation. Liberty unacquired, merely found, will on the test fail like the Dead-Sea-apple or the magician’s plenty.
U||The war that the people of India have declared and which will purify and consolidate India, and forge for her a true and stable liberty is a war with the latest and most effective weapon. In this war, what has hitherto been in the world an undesirable but necessary incident in freedom’s battles, the killing of innocent men, has been eliminated; and that which is the true essential for forging liberty, the self-purification and self-strengthening of men and women has been kept pure and unalloyed. It is for men, women and youth, every one of them that lives in and loves India, to do his bit in this battle, not waiting for others, not calculating the chances of his surviving the battle to enjoy the fruits of his sacrifice. Soldiers in the old-world wars did not insure their lives before going to the front. The privilege of youth in special is for country’s sake to exercise their comparative freedom and give up the yearning for lives and careers built on the slavery of the people.
U||That on which a foreign government truly rests whatever may be the illusions on their or our part is not the strength of its armed forces, but our own co-operation. Actual service on the part of one generation, and educational preparation for future service on the part of the next generation are the two main branches of this co-operation of slaves in the perpetuation of slavery. The boycott of government service and the law-courts is aimed at the first, the boycott of government controlled schools is to stop the second. If either the one or the other of these two branches of co-operation is withdrawn in sufficient measure, there will be an automatic and perfectly peaceful change from slavery to liberty.
U||The beat preparation for any one who desires to take part in the great battle now going on is a silent study of the writings and speeches collected herein, and proposed to be completed in a supplementary volume to be soon issued.
U||C. RAJAGOPALACHAR
U||II. THE KHILAFAT
U||WHY I HAVE JOINED THE KHILAFAT MOVEMENT
U||An esteemed South African friend who is at present living in England has written to me a letter from which I make the following excerpts:—
U||“You will doubtless remember having met me in South Africa at the time when the Rev. J.J. Doke was assisting you in your campaign there and I subsequently returned to England deeply impressed with the rightness of your attitude in that country. During the months before war I wrote and lectured and spoke on your behalf in several places which I do not regret. Since returning from military service, however, I have noticed from the papers that you appear to be adopting a more militant attitude... I notice a report in “The Times” that you are assisting and countenancing a union between the Hindus and Moslems with a view of embarrassing England and the Allied Powers in the matter of the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire or the ejection of the Turkish Government from Constantinople. Knowing as I do your sense of justice and your humane instincts I feel that I am entitled, in view of the humble part that I have taken to promote your interests on this side, to ask you whether this latter report is correct. I
U|| cannot believe that you have wrongly countenanced a movement to place the cruel and unjust despotism of the Stamboul Government above the interests of humanity, for if any country has crippled these interests in the East it has surely been Turkey. I am personally familiar with the conditions in Syria and Armenia and I can only suppose that if the report, which “The Times” has published is correct, you have thrown to one side, your moral responsibilities and allied yourself with one of the prevailing anarchies. However, until I hear that this is not your attitude I cannot prejudice my mind. Perhaps you will do me the favour of sending me a reply.”
U||I have sent a reply to the writer. But as the views expressed in the quotation are likely to be shared by many of my English friends and as I do not wish, if I can possibly help it, to forfeit their friendship or their esteem I shall endeavour to state my position as clearly as I can on the Khilafat question. The letter shows what risk public men run through irresponsible journalism. I have not seen The Times report, referred to by my friend. But it is evident that the report has made the writer to suspect my alliance with “the prevailing anarchies” and to think that I have “thrown to one side” my “moral responsibilities.”
U||It is just my sense of moral responsibilities which has made me take up the Khilafat question and to identify myself entirely with the Mahomedans. It is perfectly true that I am assisting and countenancing the union between Hindus and Muslims, but certainly not with “a view of embarrassing England and the Allied Powers in the matter of the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire,” it is contrary to my creed to embarrass governments or anybody else. This does not how ever mean that certain acts of mine may not result in embarrassment. But I should not hold myself responsible for having caused embarrassment when I resist the wrong of a wrong-doer by refusing assistance in his wrong-doing. On the Khilafat question I refuse to be party to a broken pledge. Mr. Lloyd George’s solemn declaration is practically the whole of the case for Indian Mahomedans and when that case is fortified by scriptural authority it becomes unanswerable. Moreover, it is incorrect to say that I have “allied myself to one of the preva
U||iling anarchies” or that I have wrongly countenanced the movement to place the cruel and unjust despotism of the Stamboul Government above the interests of humanity. In the whole of the Mahomedan demand there is no insistance on the retention of the so-called unjust despotism of the Stamboul Government; on the contrary the Mahomedans have accepted the principle of taking full guarantees from that Government for the protection of non-Muslim minorities. I do not know how far the condition of Armenia and Syria may be considered an ‘anarchy’ and how far the Turkish Government may be held responsible for it. I much suspect that the reports from these quarters are much exaggerated and that the European powers are themselves in a measure responsible for what misrule there may be in Armenia and Syria. But I am in no way interested in supporting Turkish or any other anarchy. The Allied Powers can easily prevent it by means other than that of ending Turkish rule or dismembering and weakening the Ottoman Empire. 
U||The Allied Powers are not dealing with a new situation. If Turkey was to be partitioned, the position should have been made clear at the commencement of the war. There would then have been no question of a broken pledge. As it is, no Indian Mahomedan has any regard for the promises of British Ministers. In his opinion, the cry against Turkey is that of Christianity vs. Islam with England as the louder in the cry. The latest cablegram from Mr. Mahomed Ali strengthens the impression, for he says that unlike as in England his deputation is receiving much support from the French Government and the people.
U||Thus, if it is true, as I hold it is true that the Indian Mussalmans have a cause that is just and is supported by scriptural authority, then for the Hindus not to support them to the utmost would be a cowardly breach of brotherhood and they would forfeit all claim to consideration from their Mahomedan countrymen. As a public-server therefore, I would be unworthy of the position I claim, if I did not support Indian Mussalmans in their struggle to maintain the Khilafat in accordance with their religious belief. I believe that in supporting them I am rendering a service to the Empire, because by assisting my Mahomedan countrymen to give a disciplined expression to their sentiment it becomes possible to make the agitation thoroughly, orderly and even successful.
U||THE TURKISH TREATY
U||The Turkish treaty will be out on the 10th of May. It is stated to provide for the internationalisation of the Straits, the occupation of Gallipoli by the Allies, the maintenance of Allied contingents in Constantinople and the appointment of a Commission of Control over Turkish finances. The San Remo Conference has entrusted Britain with Mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine and France with the Mandate for Syria. As regards Smyrna the accounts so far received inform that Turkish suzerainty over Smyrna will be indicated by the fact that the population will not be entitled to send delegates to the Greek Parliament but at the end of five years local Smyrna Parliament will have the right of voting in favour of union with Greece and in such an event Turkish suzerainty will cease. Turkish suzerainty will be confined to the area within the Chatalja lines. With regard to Emir Foisul’s position there is no news except that the Mandates of Britain and France transform his military title into a civil title.
U||We have given above the terms of the Turkish treaty as indicated in Router’s messages. These reports are incomplete and all of them are not equally authenticated. But if these terms are true, they are a challenge to the Muslim demands. Turkish Sovereignty is confined to the Chatalja lines. This means that the Big Three of the Supreme Council have cut off Thrace from Turkish dominions. This is a distinct breach of the pledge given by one of these Three, viz., the Premier of the British Empire. To remain within the Chatalja lines and, we are afraid, as a dependent of the Allies, is for the Sultan a humiliating position inconsistent with the Koranic injunctions. Such a restricted position of the Turks is virtually a success of the bag and baggage school.
U||It is not yet known how the Supreme Council disposed of the rich and renowned lands of Asia Minor. If Mr. Lloyd George’s views recently expressed in this respect have received the Allies’ sanction—it is probable—nothing less than a common control is expected. The decision in the case of Smyrna will be satisfying to none, though the Allies seem to have made by their arrangement a skillful attempt to please all the parties concerned. Mr. Lloyd George, in his reply to the Khilafat Deputation, had talked about the careful investigations by an impartial committee and had added; “The great majority of the population undoubtedly prefer Greek rule to Turkish rule, so I understand” But the decision postpones to carry out his understanding till a period of five years.
U||When we come to the question of mandates, the Allied Powers’ motives come out more distinctly. The Arabs’ claim of independence was used as a difficulty against keeping Turkish Sovereignty. This was defended in the of self-determination and by pointing out parallels of Transylvania and other provinces. When the final moment came, the Allies have ventured to divide the spoils amongst themselves. Britain is given the mandate over Mesopotamia and Palestine and France has the mandate over Syria. The Arab delegation complains in their note lately issued expressing their disappointment at the Supreme Council’s decision with regard to the Arab liberated countries, which, it declares, is contrary to the principle of self-determination.
U||So what little news has arrived about the Turkish treaty, is uniformly disquieting. The Moslems have found sufficient ground to honour Russia, more than the Allies. Russia has recognised the freedom of Khiva and Bokhara. The Moslem world, as H. M. the Amir of Afghanistan said in his speech, will feel grateful towards Russia in spite of all the rumours abroad about its anarchy and disorder, whereas the whole Moslem world will resent the action of the other European nations who have allied with each other to carry out a joint coercion and extinction of Turkey in the name of self-determination and partly in the guise of the interest of civilization.
U||The terms of the Turkish treaty are not only a breach of the Premier’s pledge, not only a sin against the principle of self-determination, but they also show a reckless indifference of the Allied Powers towards the Koranic injunctions. The terms point out that Mr. Lloyd George’s misinformed ideas of Khilafat have prevailed in the Council. Like Mr. Lloyd George other statesmen also at San Remo have compared Caliphate with Popedom and ignored the Koronic idea of associating spiritual power with temporal power. These misguided statesmen were too much possessed by haughtiness and so they refused to receive any enlightenment on the question of Khilafat from the Deputation. They could have corrected themselves had they heard Mr. Mahomed Ali on this point. Speaking at the Essex Hall meeting Mr. Mahomed Ali distinguished between Popedom and Caliphate and clearly explained what Caliphate means. He said:
U||“Islam is supernational and not national, the basis of Islamic sympathy is a common outlook on life and common culture.... And it has two centres. The personal centre is the island of Arabia. The Khalifa is the Commander of the Faithful and his orders must be obeyed by all Muslims so long and so long only, as they are not at variance with the Commandments of God and the Traditions of the Prophet. But since there is no lacerating distinction between things temporal and things spiritual, the Khalifa is something more than a Pope and cannot be “Vaticanised.” But he is also less than a Pope for he is not infallible. If he persists in un-Islamic conduct we can depose him. And we have deposed him more than once. But so long as he orders only that which Islam demands we must support him. He and no other ruler is the Defender of our faith.”
U||These few words could have removed the mis-undertakings rooted in the minds of those that at San Remo, if they were in earnest for a just solution. But Mr. Mahomed Ali’s deputation was not given any hearing by the Peace Conference. They were told that the Peace Conference had already heard the official delegation of India on this question. But the wrong notions the Allies still entertain about Caliphate are a sufficient indication of the effects of the work of this official delegation. The result of these wrong notions is the present settlement and this unjust settlement will unsettle the world. They know not what they do.
U||TURKISH PEACE TERMS
U||The question of question to-day is the Khilafat question, otherwise known as that of the Turkish peace terms. His Excellency the Viceroy deserves our thanks for receiving the joint deputation even at this late hour, especially when he was busy preparing to receive the head of the different provinces. His Excellency must be thanked for the unfailing courtesy with which he received the deputation and the courteous language in which his reply was couched. But mere courtesy, valuable as it is at all times, never so valuable as at this, is not enough at this critical moment. ‘Sweet words butter no parsnips’ is a proverb more applicable to-day than ever before. Behind the courtesy there was the determination to punish Turkey. Punishment of Turkey is a thing which Muslim sentiment cannot tolerate for a moment. Muslim soldiers are as responsible for the result of the war as any others. It was to appease them that Mr. Asquith said when Turkey decided to join the Central Powers that the British Government had no d
U||esigns on Turkey and that His Majesty’s Government would never think of punishing the Sultan for the misdeeds of the Turkish Committee. Examined by that standard the Viceregal reply is not only disappointing but it is a fall from truth and justice.
U||What is this British Empire? It is as much Mahomedan and Hindu as it is Christian. Its religious neutrality is not a virtue, or if it is, it is a virtue of necessity. Such a mighty Empire could not be held together on any other terms. British ministers are therefore bound to protect Mahomedan interests as any other. Indeed as the Muslim rejoinder says, they are bound to make the cause their own. What is the use of His Excellency having presented the Muslim claim before the Conference? If the cause is lost the Mahomedans will be entitled to think that Britain did not do her duty by them. And the Viceregal reply confirms the view. When His Excellency says that Turkey must suffer for her having joined the Central Powers he but expresses the opinion of British ministers. We hope, therefore, with the framers of the Muslim rejoinder that His Majesty’s ministers will mend the mistakes if any have been committed and secure a settlement that would satisfy Mahomedan sentiment.
U||What does the sentiment demand? The preservation of the Khilafat with such guarantee as may be necessary for the protection of the interests of the non-Muslim races living under Turkish rule and the Khalif’s control over Arabia and the Holy Places with such arrangement as may be required for guaranteeing Arab self-rule, should the Arabs desire it. It is hardly possible to state the claim more fairly than has been done. It is a claim backed by justice, by the declarations of British ministers and by the unanimous Hindu and Muslim opinion. It would be midsummer madness to reject or whittle down a claim so backed.
U||THE SUZERAINTY OVER ARABIA
U||“As I told you in my last letter I think Mr. Gandhi has made a serious mistake in the Kailafat business. The Indian Mahomedans base their demand on the assertion that their religion requires the Turkish rule over Arabia: but when they have against them in this matter, the Arabs themselves, it is impossible to regard the theory of the Indian Mahomedans as essential to Islam. After all if the Arabs do not represent Islam, who does? It is as if the German Roman Catholics made a demand in the name of Roman Catholicism with Rome and the Italians making a contrary demand. But even if the religion of the Indian Mahomedans did require that Turkish rule should be imposed upon the Arabs against their will, one could not, now-a-days, recognise as a really religious demand, one which required the continued oppression of one people by another. When an assurance was given at the beginning of the war to the Indian Mahomedans that the Mahomedan religion would be respected, that could never have meant that a temporal sover
U||eignty which violated the principles of self-determination would be upheld. We could not now stand by and see the Turks re-conquer the Arabs (for the Arabs would certainly fight against them) without grossly betraying the Arabs to whom we have given pledges. It is not true that the Arab hostility to the Turks was due simply to European suggestion. No doubt, during the war we availed ourselves of the Arab hostility to the Turks to get another ally, but the hostility had existed long before the war. The Non-Turkish Mahomedan subjects of the Sultan in general wanted to get rid of his rule. It is the Indian Mahomedans who have no experience of that rule who want to impose it on others. As a matter of fact the idea of any restoration of Turkish rule in Syria or Arabia, seems so remote from all possibilities that to discuss it seems like discussing a restoration of the Holy Roman Empire. I cannot conceive what series of events could bring it about. The Indian Mahomedans certainly could not march into Arabia themse
U||lves and conquer the Arabs for the Sultan. And no amount of agitation and trouble in India would ever induce England to put back Turkish rule in Arabia. In this matter it is not English Imperialism which the Indian Mahomedans are up against, but the mass of English Liberal and Humanitarian opinion, the mass of the better opinion of England, which wants self-determination to go forward in India. Supposing the Indian Mahomedans could stir up an agitation so violent in India as to sever the connection between India and the British Crown, still they would not be any nearer to their purpose. For to-day they do have considerable influence on British world-policy. Even if in this matter of the Turkish question their influence has not been sufficient to turn the scale against the very heavy weights on the other side, it has weighed in the scale. But apart from the British connection, Indian Mahomedans would have no influence at all outside India. They would not count for more in world politics than the Mahomedans of
U|| China. I think it is likely (apart from the pressure of America on the other side. I should say certain) that the influence of the Indian Mahomedans may at any rate avail to keep the Sultan in Constantinople. But I doubt whether they will gain any advantage by doing so. For a Turkey cut down to the Turkish parts of Asia-Minor, Constantinople would be a very inconvenient capital. I think its inconvenience would more than outweigh the sentimental gratification of keeping up a phantom of the old Ottoman Empire. But if the Indian Mahomedans want the Sultan to retain his place in Constantinople I think the assurances given officially by the Viceroy in India now binds us to insist on his remaining there and I think he will remain there in spite of America.”
U||This is an extract, from the letter of an Englishman enjoying a position in Great Britain, to a friend in India. It is a typical letter, sober, honest, to the point and put in such graceful language that whilst it challenges you, it commands your respect by its very gracefulness. But it is just this attitude based upon insufficient or false information which has ruined many a cause in the British Isles. The superficiality, the one-sidedness the inaccuracy and often even dishonesty that have crept into modern journalism, continuously mislead honest men who want to see nothing but justice done. Then there are always interested groups whose business it is to serve their ends by means of faul or food. And the honest Englishman wishing to vote for justice but swayed by conflicting opinions and dominated by distorted versions, often ends by becoming an instrument of injustice.
U||The writer of the letter quoted above has built up convincing argument on imaginary data. He has successfully shown that the Mahomedan case, as it has been presented to him, is a rotten case. In India, where it is not quite easy to distort facts about the Khilafat, English friends admit the utter justice of the Indian-Mahomedan claim. But they plead helplessness and tell us that the Government of India and Mr. Montagu have done all it was humanly possible for them to do. And if now the judgment goes against Islam, Indian Mahomedans should resign themselves to it. This extraordinary state of things would not be possible except under this modern rush and preoccupations of all responsible people.
U||Let us for a moment examine the case as it has been imagined by the writer. He suggests that Indian Mahomedans want Turkish rule in Arabia in spite of the opposition of the Arabs themselves, and that, if the Arabs do not want Turkish rule, the writer argues, no false religions sentiment can be permitted to interfere with self-determination of the Arabs when India herself has been pleading for that very status. Now the fact is that the Mahomedans, as is known to everybody who has at all studied the case, have never asked for Turkish rule in Arabia in opposition to the Arabs. On the contrary, they have said that they have no intention of resisting Arabian self-government. All they ask for is Turkish suzerainty over Arabia which would guarantee complete self-rule for the Arabs. They want Khalif’s control of the Holy Places of Islam. In other words they ask for nothing more than what was guaranteed by Mr. Lloyd George and on the strength of which guarantee Mahomedan soldiers split their blood on behalf of the 
U||Allied Powers. All the elaborate argument therefore and the cogent reasoning of the above extract fall to pieces based as they are upon a case that has never existed. I have thrown myself heart and soul into this question because British pledges abstract justice, and religious sentiment coincide. I can conceive the possibility of a blind and fanatical religious sentiment existing in opposition to pure justice. I should then resist the former and fight for the latter. Nor would I insist upon pledges given dishonestly to support an unjust cause as has happened with England in the case of the secret treaties. Resistance there becomes not only lawful but obligatory on the part of a nation that prides itself on its righteousness.
U||It is unnecessary for me to examine the position imagined by the English friend, viz., how India would have fared had she been an independent power. It is unnecessary because Indian Mahomedans, and for that matter India, are fighting for a cause that is admittedly just; a cause in aid of which they are invoking the whole-hearted support of the British people. I would however venture to suggest that this is a cause in which mere sympathy will not suffice. It is a cause which demands support that is strong enough to bring about substantial justice.
U||FURTHER QUESTIONS ANSWERED
U||I have been overwhelmed with public criticism and private advice and even anonymous letters telling me exactly what I should do. Some are impatient that I do not advise immediate and extensive non-co-operation; others tell me what harm I am doing the country by throwing it knowingly in a tempest of violence on either side. It is difficult for me to deal with the whole of the criticism, but I would summarize some of the objections and endeavour to answer them to the best of my ability. These are in addition to those I have already answered:—
U||(1) Turkish claim is immoral or unjust and how can I, a lover of truth and justice, support it? (2) Even if the claim be just in theory, the Turk is hopelessly incapable, weak and cruel. He does not deserve any assistance.
U||(3) Even if Turkey deserves all that is claimed for her, why should I land India in an international struggle?
U||(4) It is no part of the Indian Mahomedans’ business to meddle in this affair. If they cherish any political ambition, they have tried, they have failed and they should now sit still. If it is a religious matter with them, it cannot appeal to the Hindu reason in the manner it is put and in any case Hindus ought not to identify themselves with Mahomedans in their religious quarrel with Christendom.
U||(5) In no case should I advocate non-co-operation which in its extreme sense is nothing but a rebellion, no matter how peaceful it may be.
U||(6) Moreover, my experience of last year must show me that it is beyond the capacity of any single human being to control the forces of violence that are lying dormant in the land.
U||(7) Non-co-operation is futile because people will never respond in right earnest, and reaction that might afterwards set in will be worse than the state of hopefulness we are now in.
U||(8) Non-co-operation will bring about cessation of all other activities, even working of the Reforms, thus set back the clock of progress. (9) However pure my motives may be, those of the Mussalmans are obviously revengeful.
U||I shall now answer the objections in the order in which they are stated—
U||(1) In my opinion the Turkish claim is not only not immoral and unjust, but it is highly equitable, if only because Turkey wants to retain what is her own. And the Mahomedan manifesto has definitely declared that whatever guarantees may be necessary to be taken for the protection of non-Muslim and non-Turkish races, should be taken so as to give the Christians theirs and the Arabs their self-government under the Turkish suzerainty.
U||(2) I do not believe the Turk to be weak, incapable or cruel. He is certainly disorganised and probably without good generalship. He has been obliged to fight against heavy odds. The argument of weakness, incapacity and cruelty one often hears quoted in connection with those from whom power is sought to be taken away. About the alleged massacres a proper commission has been asked for, but never granted. And in any case security can be taken against oppression.
U||(3) I have already stated that if I were not interested in the Indian Mahomedans, I would not interest myself in the welfare of the Turks any more than I am in that of the Austrians or the Poles. But I am bound as an Indian to share the sufferings and trial of fellow-Indians. If I deem the Mahomedan to be my brother. It is my duty to help him in his hour of peril to the best of my ability, if his cause commends itself to me as just.
U||(4) The fourth refers to the extent Hindus should join hands with the Mahomedans. It is therefore a matter of feeling and opinion. It is expedient to suffer for my Mahomedan brother to the utmost in a just cause and I should therefore travel with him along the whole road so long as the means employed by him are as honourable as his end. I cannot regulate the Mahomedan feeling. I must accept his statement that the Khilafat is with him a religious question in the sense that it binds him to reach the goal even at the cost of his own life.
U||(5) I do not consider non-co-operation to be a rebellion, because it is free from violence. In a larger sense all opposition to a Government measure is a rebellion. In that sense, rebellion in a just cause is a duty, the extent of opposition being determined by the measure of the injustice done and felt.
U||(6) My experience of last year shows me that in spite of aberrations in some parts of India, the country was entirely under control that the influence of Satyagraha was profoundly for its good and that where violence did break out there were local causes that directly contributed to it. At the same time I admit that even the violence that did take place on the part of the people and the spirit of lawlessness that was undoubtedly shown in some parts should have remained under check. I have made ample acknowledgment of the miscalculation I then made. But all the painful experience that I then gained did not any way shake my belief in Satyagraha or in the possibility of that matchless force being utilised in India. Ample provision is being made this time to avoid the mistakes of the past. But I must refuse to be deterred from a clear course; because it may be attended by violence totally unintended and in spite of extraordinary efforts that are being made to prevent it. At the same time I must make my position 
U||clear. Nothing can possibly prevent a Satyagrahi from doing his duty because of the frown of the authorities. I would risk, if necessary, a million lives so long as they are voluntary sufferers and are innocent, spotless victims. It is the mistakes of the people that matter in a Satyagraha campaign. Mistakes, even insanity must be expected from the strong and the powerful, and the moment of victory has come when there is no retort to the mad fury of the powerful, but a voluntary, dignified and quiet submission but not submission to the will of the authority that has put itself in the wrong. The secret of success lies therefore in holding every English life and the life of every officer serving the Government as sacred as those of our own dear ones. All the wonderful experience I have gained now during nearly 40 years of conscious existence, has convinced me that there is no gift so precious as that of life. I make bold to say that the moment the Englishmen feel that although they are in India in a hopeless m
U||inority, their lives are protected against harm not because of the matchless weapons of destruction which are at their disposal, but because Indians refuse to take the lives even of those whom they may consider to be utterly in the wrong that moment will see a transformation in the English nature in its relation to India and that moment will also be the moment when all the destructive cutlery that is to be had in India will begin to rust. I know that this is a far-off vision. That cannot matter to me. It is enough for me to see the light and to act up to it, and it is more than enough when I gain companions in the onward march. I have claimed in private conversations with English friends that it is because of my incessant preaching of the gospel of non-violence and my having successfully demonstrated its practical utility that so far the forces of violence, which are undoubtedly in existence in connection with the Khilafat movement, have remained under complete control.
U||(7) From a religious standpoint the seventh objection is hardly worth considering. If people do not respond to the movement of non-co-operation, it would be a pity, but that can be no reason for a reformer not to try. It would be to me a demonstration that the present position of hopefulness is not dependent on any inward strength or knowledge, but it is hope born of ignorance and superstition.
U||(8) If non-co-operation is taken up in earnest, it must bring about a cessation of all other activities including the Reforms, but I decline to draw therefore the corollary that it will set back the clock of progress. On the contrary, I consider non-co-operation to be such a powerful and pure instrument, that if it is enforced in an earnest spirit, it will be like seeking first the Kingdom of God and everything else following as a matter of course. People will have then realised their true power. They would have learnt the value of discipline, self-control, joint action, non-violence, organisation and everything else that goes to make a nation great and good, and not merely great.
U||(9) I do not know that I have a right to arrogate greater purity for myself than for our Mussalman brethren. But I do admit that they do not believe in my doctrine of non-violence to the full extent. For them it is a weapon of the weak, an expedient. They consider non-co-operation without violence to be the only thing open to them in the war of direct action. I know that if some of them could offer successful violence, they would do to-day. But they are convinced that humanly speaking it is an impossibility. For them, therefore, non-co-operation is a matter not merely of duty but also of revenge. Whereas I take up non-co-operation against the Government as I have actually taken it up in practice against members of my own family. I entertain very high regard for the British constitution, I have not only no enmity against Englishmen but I regard much in English character as worthy of my emulation. I count many as my friends. It is against my religion to regard any one as an enemy. I entertain similar sentiment
U||s with respect to Mahomedans. I find their cause to be just and pure. Although therefore their viewpoint is different from mine I do not hesitate to associate with them and invite them to give my method a trial, for, I believe that the use of a pure weapon even from a mistaken motive does not fail to produce some good, even as the telling of truth if only because for the time being it is the best policy, is at least so much to the good.
U||MR. CANDLER’S OPEN LETTER
U||Mr. Candler has favoured me with an open letter on this question of questions. The letter has already appeared in the Press. I can appreciate Mr. Candler’s position as I would like him and other Englishmen to appreciate mine and that of hundreds of Hindus who feel as I do. Mr. Candler’s letter is an attempt to show that Mr. Lloyd George’s pledge is not in any way broken by the peace terms. I quite agree with him that Mr. Lloyd George’s words ought not to be torn from their context to support the Mahomedan claim. These are Mr. Lloyd George’s words as quoted in the recent Viceregal message: “Nor are we fighting to destroy Austria-Hungary or to deprive Turkey of its capital or of the rich and renowned lands of Asia Minor and Thrace which are predominantly Turkish in race.” Mr. Candler seems to read ‘which’, as if it meant ‘if they,’ whereas I give the pronoun its natural meaning, namely, that the Prime Minister knew in 1918, that the lands referred to by him were “predominantly Turkish i
U||n race.” And if this is the meaning I venture to suggest that the pledge has been broken in a most barefaced manner, for there is practically nothing left to the Turk of ‘the rich and renowned lands of Asia Minor and Thrace.’
U||I have already my view of the retention of the Sultan in Constantinople. It is an insult to the intelligence of man to suggest that ‘the maintenance of the Turkish Empire in the homeland of the Turkish race with its capital at Constantinople has been left unimpaired by the terms of peace. This is the other passage from the speech which I presume Mr. Candler wants me to read together with the one already quoted:—
U||“While we do not challenge the maintenance of the Turkish Empire in the home-land of the Turkish race with its capital at Constantinople, the passage between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea being inter-nationalised, Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine are in our judgment entitled to a recognition of their separate national condition.”
U||Did that mean entire removal of Turkish influence, extinction of Turkish suzerainty and the introduction of European-Christian influence under the guise of Mandates? Have the Moslems of Arabia, Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine been committed, or is the new arrangement being superimposed upon them by Powers conscious of their own brute-strength rather than of justice of their action? I for one would nurse by every legitimate means the spirit of independence in the brave Arabs, but I shudder to think what will happen to them under the schemes of exploitation of their country by the greedy capitalists protected as they will be by the mandatory Powers. If the pledge is to be fulfilled, let these places have full self-government with suzerainty to be retained with Turkey as has been suggested by the Times of India. Let there be all the necessary guarantees taken from Turkey about the internal independence of the Arabs. But to remove that suzerainty, to deprive the Khalif of the wardenship of the Holy Pla
U||ces is to render Khilafat a mockery which no Mahomedan can possibly look upon with equanimity, I am not alone in my interpretation of the pledge. The Right Hon’ble Ameer Ali calls the peace terms a breach of faith. Mr. Charles Roberts reminds the British public that the Indian Mussalman sentiment regarding the Turkish Treaty is based upon the Prime Minister’s pledge “regarding Thrace, Constantinople and Turkish lands in Asia Minor, repeated on February 26 last with deliberation by Mr. Lloyd George. Mr. Roberts holds that the pledge must be treated as a whole, not as binding only regarding Constantinople but also binding as regards Thrace and Asia Minor. He describes the pledge as binding upon the nation as a whole and its breach in any part as a gross breach of faith on the part of the British Empire. He demands that if there is an unanswerable reply to the charge of breach of faith it ought to be given and adds the Prime Minister may regard his own word lightly if he chooses, but he has no right to br
U||eak a pledge given on behalf of the nation. He concludes that it is incredible that such pledge should not have been kept in the letter and in the spirit.” He adds: “I have reason to believe that these views are fully shared by prominent members of the Cabinet.”
U||I wonder if Mr. Candler knows what is going on to-day in England. Mr. Pickthall writing in New Age says: “No impartial international enquiry into the whole question of the Armenian massacres has been instituted in the ample time which has elapsed since the conclusion of armistice with Turkey. The Turkish Government has asked for such enquiry. But the Armenian organisations and the Armenian partisans refuse to hear of such a thing, declaring that the Bryce and Lepssens reports are quite sufficient to condemn the Turks. In other words the judgment should be given on the case for prosecution alone. The inter-allied commission which investigated the unfortunate events in Smyrna last year, made a report unfavourable to Greek claims. Therefore, that report has not been published here in England, though in other countries it has long been public property.” He then goes on to show how money is being scattered by Armenian and Greek emissaries in order to popularise their cause and adds: “This conjunction of den
U||se ignorance and cunning falsehood is fraught with instant danger to the British realm,” and concludes: “A Government and people which prefer propaganda to fact as the ground of policy—and foreign policy at that—is self-condemned.”
U||I have reproduced the above extract in order to show that the present British policy has been affected by propaganda of an unscrupulous nature. Turkey which was dominant over two million square miles of Asia, Africa and Europe in the 17th century, under the terms of the treaty, says the London Chronicle, has dwindled down to little more than 1,000 square miles. It says, “All European Turkey could now be accommodated comfortably between the Landsend and the Tamar, Cornawal alone exceeding its total area and but for its alliance with Germany, Turkey could have been assured of retaining at least sixty thousand square miles of the Eastern Balkans.” I do not know whether the Chronicle view is generally shared. Is it by way of punishment that Turkey is to undergo such shrinkage, or is it because justice demands it? If Turkey had not made the mistake of joining Germany, would the principle of nationality have been still applied to Armenia, Arabia, Mesopotamia and Palestine?
U||Let me now remind those who think with Mr. Candler that the promise was not made by Mr. Lloyd George to the people of India in anticipation of the supply of recruits continuing. In defending his own statement Mr. Lloyd George is reported to have said:
U||“The effect of the statement in India was that recruiting went up appreciably from that very moment. They were not all Mahomedans but there were many Mahomedans amongst them. Now we are told that was an offer to Turkey. But they rejected it, and therefore we were absolutely free. It was not. It is too often forgotten that we are the greatest Mahomedan power in the world and one-fourth of the population of the British Empire is Mahomedan. There have been no more loyal adherents to the throne and no more effective and loyal supporters of the Empire in its hour of trial. We gave a solemn pledge and they accepted it. They are disturbed by the prospect of our not abiding by it.”
U||Who shall interpret that pledge and how? How did the Government of India itself interpret it? Did it or did it not energetically support the claim for the control of the Holy Places of Islam vesting in the Khalif? Did the Government of India suggest that the whole of Jazirat-ul-Arab could be taken away consistently with that pledge from the sphere of influence of the Khalif, and given over to the Allies as mandatory Powers? Why does the Government of India sympathise with the Indian Mussalmans if the terms are all they should be? So much for the pledge. I would like to guard myself against being understood that I stand or fall absolutely by Mr. Lloyd George’s declaration. I have advisedly used the adverb ‘practically’ in connection with it. It is an important qualification.’
U||Mr. Candler seems to suggest that my goal is something more than merely attaining justice on the Khilafat. If so, he is right. Attainment of justice is undoubtedly the corner-stone, and if I found that I was wrong in my conception of justice on this question, I hope I shall have the courage immediately to retrace my steps. But by helping the Mahomedans of India at a critical moment in their history, I want to buy their friendship. Moreover, if I can carry the Mahomedans with me I hope to wean Great Britain from the downward path along which the Prime Minister seems to me to be taking her. I hope also to show to India and the Empire at large that given a certain amount of capacity for self-sacrifice, justice can be secured by peacefullest and cleanest means without sowing or increasing bitterness between English and Indians. For, whatever may be the temporary effect of my methods, I know enough of them to feel certain that they alone are immune from lasting bitterness. They are untainted with hatred, expedien
U||ce or untruth.
U||IN PROCESS OF KEEPING
U||The writer of ‘Current Topics’ in the “Times of India” has attempted to challenge the statement made in my Khilafat article regarding ministerial pledges, and in doing so cites Mr. Asquith’s Guild-Hall speech of November 10, 1914. When I wrote the articles, I had in mind Mr. Asquith’s speech. I am sorry that he ever made that speech. For, in my humble opinion, it betrayed to say the least, a confusion of thought. Could he think of the Turkish people as apart from the Ottoman Government? And what is the meaning of the death-knell of Ottoman Dominion in Europe and Asia if it be not the death knell of Turkish people as a free and governing race? Is it, again, true historically that the Turkish rule has always been a blight that ‘has withered some of the fairest regions of the earth?’ And what is the meaning of his statement that followed, viz., “Nothing is further from our thoughts than to imitate or encourage a crusade against their belief?” If words have any meaning, the qualifications tha
U||t Mr. Asquith introduced in his speech should have meant a scrupulous regard for Indian Muslim feeling. And if that be the meaning of his speech, without anything further to support me I would claim that even Mr. Asquith’s assurance is in danger of being set at nought if the resolutions of the San Remo Conference are to be crystallised into action. But I base remarks on a considered speech made by Mr. Asquith’s successor two years later when things had assumed a more threatening shape than in 1914 and when the need for Indian help was much greater than in 1914. His pledge would bear repetition till it is fulfilled. He said: “Nor are we fighting to deprive Turkey of its capital or of the rich and renowned lands of Asia Minor and Thrace which are predominantly Turkish in race. We do not challenge the maintenance of the Turkish Empire in the homelands of the Turkish race with its capital at Constantinople.” If only every word of this pledge is fulfilled both in letter and in spirit, there would be littl
U||e left for quarrelling about. In so far as Mr. Asquith’s declaration can be considered hostile to the Indian Muslim claim, it its superseded by the later and more considered declaration of Mr. Lloyd George—a declaration made irrevocable by fulfilment of the consideration it expected, viz. the enlistment of the brave Mahomedan soldiery which fought in the very place which is now being partitioned in spite of the pledge. But the writer of ‘Current Topics’ says Mr. Lloyd George “is now in process of keeping his pledge” I hope he is right. But what has already happened gives little ground for any such hope. For, imprisonment or internment of the Khalif in his own capital will be not only a mockery of fulfilment but it would he adding injury to insult. Either the Turkish Empire is to be maintained in the homelands of the Turkish race with its capital at Constantinople or it is not. If it is, let the Indian Mahomedans feel the full glow of it or if the Empire is to be broken up, let the mask of hypocri
U||sy be lifted and India see the truth in its nakedness. To join the Khilafat movement then means to join a movement to keep inviolate the pledge of a British minister. Surely, such a movement is worth much greater sacrifice than may be involved in non-co-operation.
U||APPEAL TO THE VICEROY
U||Your Excellency.
U||As one who has enjoyed a certain measure of your Excellency’s confidence, and as one who claims to be a devoted well-wisher of the British Empire, I owe it to your Excellency, and through your Excellency to His Majesty’s Ministers, to explain my connection with and my conduct in the Khilafat question.
U||At the very earliest stages of the war, even whilst I was in London organising the Indian Volunteer Ambulance Corps, I began to interest myself in the Khilafat question. I perceived how deeply moved the little Mussalman World in London was when Turkey decided to throw in her lot with Germany. On my arrival in India in the January of 1915, I found the same anxiousness and earnestness among the Mussalmans with whom I came in contact. Their anxiety became intense when the information about the Secret Treaties leaked out. Distrust of British intentions filled their minds, and despair took possession of them. Even at that moment I advised my Mussalman friends not to give way to despair, but to express their fear and their hopes in a disciplined manner. It will be admitted that the whole of Mussalman India has behaved in a singularly restrained manner during the past five years and that the leaders have been able to keep the turbulent sections of their community under complete control.
U||The peace terms and your Excellency’s defence of them have given the Mussalmans of India a shock from which it will be difficult for them to recover. The terms violate ministerial pledges and utterly disregard Mussalman sentiment. I consider that as a staunch Hindu wishing to live on terms of the closest friendship with my Mussalman countrymen. I should be an unworthy son of India if I did not stand by them in their hour of trial. In my humble opinion their cause is just. They claim that Turkey must be punished if their sentiment is to be respected. Muslim soldiers did fight to inflict punishment on their own Khalifa or to deprive him of his territories. The Mussalman attitude has been consistent, throughout these five years.
U||My duty to the Empire to which I owe my loyalty requires me to resist the cruel violence that has been done to the Mussalman sentiment. So far as I am aware, Mussulmans and Hindus have as a whole lost faith in British justice and honour. The report of the majority of the Hunter Committee, Your Excellency’s despatch thereon and Mr. Montagu’s reply have only aggravated the distrust.
U||In these circumstances the only course open to one like me is either in despair to sever all connection with British rule, or, if I still retained faith in the inherent superiority of the British constitution to all others at present in vogue to adopt such means as will rectify the wrong done, and thus restore confidence. I have not lost faith in such superiority and I am not without hope that somehow or other justice will yet be rendered if we show the requisite capacity for suffering. Indeed, my conception of that constitution is that it helps only those who are ready to help themselves. I do not believe that it protects the weak. It gives free scope to the strong to maintain their strength and develop it. The weak under it go to the wall.
U||It is, then, because I believe in the British constitution that I have advised my Mussalman friends to withdraw their support from your Excellency’s Government and the Hindus to join them, should the peace terms not be revised in accordance with the solemn pledges of Ministers and the Muslim sentiment.
U||Three courses were open to the Mahomedans in order to mark their emphatic disapproval of the utter injustice to which His Majesty’s Ministers have become party, if they have not actually been the prime perpetrators of it. They are:—
U||(1) To resort to violence,
U||(2) To advise emigration on a wholesale scale,
U||(3) Not to be party to the injustice by ceasing to co-operate with the Government.
U||Your Excellency must be aware that there was a time when the boldest, though the most thoughtless among the Mussulmans favoured violence, and the “Hijrat” (emigration) has not yet ceased to be the battle-cry. I venture to claim that I have succeeded by patient reasoning in weaning the party of violence from its ways. I confess that I did not—I did not attempt to succeed in weaning them from violence on moral grounds, but purely on utilitarian grounds. The result, for the time being at any has, however, been to stop violence. The School of “Hijrat” has received a check, if it has not stopped its activity entirely. I hold that no repression could have prevented a violent eruption, if the people had not had presented to them a form of direct action involving considerable sacrifice and ensuring success if such direct action was largely taken up by the public. Non-co-operation was the only dignified and constitutional form of such direct action. For it is the right recognised from times immemorial of th
U||e subject to refuse to assist a ruler who misrules.
U||At the same time I admit that non-co-operation practised by the mass of people is attended with grave risks. But, in a crisis such as has overtaken the Mussalmans of India, no step that is unattended with large risks, can possibly bring about the desired change. Not to run some risks now will be to court much greater risks if not virtual destruction of Law and Order.
U||But there is yet an escape from non-co-operation. The Mussalman representation has requested your Excellency to lead the agitation yourself, as did your distinguished predecessor at the time of the South African trouble. But if you cannot see your way to do so, and non-co-operation becomes a dire necessity, I hope that your Excellency will give those who have accepted my advice and myself the credit for being actuated by nothing less than a stern sense of duty.
U||I have the honour to remain,
U||Your Excellency’s faithful servant, (Sd.) M.K. GANDHI. Laburnam Road, Gamdevi, Bombay 22nd June 1920
U||THE PREMIER’S REPLY
U||The English mail has brought us a full and official report of the Premier’s speech which he recently made when he received the Khilafat deputation. Mr. Lloyd George’s speech is more definite and therefore more disappointing than H.E. the Viceroy’s reply to the deputation here. He draws quite unwarranted deductions from the same high principles on which he had based his own pledge only two years ago. He declares that Turkey must pay the penalty of defeat. This determination to punish Turkey does not become one whose immediate predecessor had, in order to appease Muslim soldiers, promised that the British Government had no designs on Turkey and that His Majesty’s Government would never think of punishing the Sultan for the misdeeds of the Turkish Committee. Mr. Lloyd George has expressed his belief that the majority of the population of Turkey did not really want to quarrel with Great Britain and that their rulers misled the country. In spite of this conviction and in spite of Mr. Asquith’s promise, 
U||he is out to punish Turkey and punish it in the name of justice.
U||He expounds the principle of self-determination and justifies the scheme of depriving Turkey of its territories one after another. While justifying this scheme he does not exclude even Thrace and this strikes the reader most, because this very Thrace he had mentioned in his pledge as predominantly Turkish. Now we are told by him that both the Turkish census and the Greek census agree in pointing out the Mussulman population in Thrace is in a considerable minority! Mr. Yakub Hussain speaking at the Madras Khilafat conference has challenged the truth of this statement. The Prime Minister cites among others also the example of Smyrna where, he says, we had a most careful investigation by a very impartial committee in the whole of the question of Smyrna and it was found that considerable majority was non-Turkish.’ Who will believe the one-sided “impartial committee’s” investigations until it is disproved that thousands of Musselmans have been murdered and hundreds of thousands have been driven away from 
U||their hearths and homes? Strangely enough Mr. Lloyd George, believes in the necessity of fresh investigations by a purposely appointed committee in Smyrna as the most authenticated and up-to-date report, whereas he would not accept Mr. Mahomed Ali’s proposal for an impartial commission in regard to Armenian massacre! Doubtful and one-sided facts and figures suffice for him even to conclude that the Turkish Government is incapable of protecting its subjects. And he proceeds to suggest foreign interference in ruling over Asia Minor in the interests of civilization. Here he cuts at the root of the Sultan’s independence. This proposal of appropriating supervision is distinctly unlike the treatment meted out to other enemy powers.
U||This detraction of the Sultan’s suzerainty is only a corollary of the Premier’s indifference towards the Muslim idea of the Caliphate. The premier’s injustice in treating the Turkish question becomes graver when he thus lightly handles the Khilafat question. There had been occasions when the British have used to their advantage the Muslim idea of associating the Caliph’s spiritual power with temporal power. Now this very association is treated as a controversial question by the great statesman.
U||Will this raise the reputation of Great Britain or stain it? Can this be tolerated by those who fought against Turkey with full faith in British honesty? Mere receipts of gratitude cannot console the wounded Mussalmans. There lies the alternative for England to choose between two mandates—a mandate over some Turkish territories which is sure to lead to chaos all over the world and a mandate over the hearts of the Muhomedans which will redeem the pledged honour of Britain. The prime minister has an unwise choice. This narrow view registers the latest temperature of British diplomacy.
U||THE MUSSULMAN REPRESENTATION
U||Slowly but surely the Mussulmans are preparing for the battle before them. They have to fight against odds that are undoubtedly heavy but not half as heavy as the prophet had against him. How often did he not put his life in danger? But his faith in God was unquenchable. He went forward with a light heart, for God was on his side, for he represented truth. If his followers have half the prophet’s faith and half his spirit of sacrifice, the odds will be presently even and will in little while turn against the despoilers of Turkey. Already the rapacity of the Allies is telling against themselves. France finds her task difficult. Greece cannot stomach her ill-gotten gains. And England finds Mesopotamia a tough job. The oil of Mosul may feed the fire she has so wantonly lighted and burn her fingers badly. The newspapers say the Arabs do not like the presence of the Indian soldiery in their midst. I do not wonder. They are a fierce and a brave people and do not understand why Indian soldiers should find themsel
U||ves in Mesopotamia. Whatever the fate of non-co-operation, I wish that not a single Indian will offer his services for Mesopotamia whether for the civil or the military department. We must learn to think for ourselves and before entering upon any employment find out whether thereby we may not make ourselves instruments of injustice. Apart from the question of Khilafat and from the point of abstract justice the English have no right to hold Mesopotamia. It is no part of our loyalty to help the Imperial Government in what is in plain language daylight robbery. If therefore we seek civil or military employment in Mesopotamia we do so for the sake of earning a livelihood. It is our duty to see that the source is not tainted.
U||It surprises me to find so many people shirking over the mention of non-co-operation. There is no instrument so clean, so harmless and yet so effective as non-co-operation. Judiciously hauled it need not produce any evil consequences. And its intensity will depend purely on the capacity of the people for sacrifice.
U||The chief thing is to prepare the atmosphere of non-co-operation. “We are not going to co-operate with you in your injustice,” is surely the right and the duty of every intelligent subject to say. Were it not for our utter servility, helplessness and want of confidence in ourselves, we would certainly grasp this clean weapon and make the most effective use of it. Even the most despotic government cannot stand except for the consent of the governed which consent is often forcibly procured by the despot. Immediately the subject ceases to fear the despotic force his power is gone. But the British government is never and nowhere entirely or laid upon force. It does make an honest attempt to secure the goodwill of the governed. But it does not hesitate to adopt unscrupulous means to compel the consent of the governed. It has not gone beyond the ‘Honesty is the best policy’ idea. It therefore bribes you into consenting its will by awarding titles, medals and ribbons, by giving you employment, by its superi
U||or financial ability to open for its employees avenues for enriching themselves and finally when these fail, it resorts to force. That is what Sir Michael O’Dwyer did and that is almost every British administrator will certainly do if he thought it necessary. If then we would not be greedy, if we would not run after titles and medals and honorary posts which do the country no good, half the battle is won.
U||My advisers are never tired of telling me that even if the Turkish peace terms are revised it will not be due to non-co-operation. I venture to suggest to them that non-co-operation has a higher purpose than mere revision of the terms. If I cannot compel revision I must at least cease to support a government that becomes party to the usurpation. And if I succeed in pushing non-co-operation to the extreme limit, I do compel the Government to choose between India and the usurpation. I have faith enough in England to know that at that moment England will expel her present jaded ministers and put in others who will make a clean sweep of the terms in consultation with an awakened India, draft terms that will be honourable to her, to Turkey and acceptable to India. But I hear my critics say “India has not the strength of purpose and the capacity for the sacrifice to achieve such a noble end. They are partly right. India has not these qualities now, because we have not—shall we not evolve them and infect the na
U||tion with them? Is not the attempt worth making? Is my sacrifice too great to gain such a great purpose?”
U||CRITICISM OF THE MUSLIM MANIFESTO
U||The Khilafat representation addressed to the Viceroy and my letter on the same subject have been severely criticised by the Anglo-Indian press. The Times of India which generally adopts an impartial attitude has taken strong exception to certain statements made in the Muslim manifesto and has devoted a paragraph of its article to an advance criticism of my suggestion that His Excellency should resign if the peace terms are not revised.
U||The Times of India excepts to the submission that the British Empire may not treat Turkey like a departed enemy. The signatories have, I think, supplied the best of reasons. They say “We respectfully submit that in the treatment of Turkey the British Government are bound to respect Indian Muslim sentiment in so far as it is neither unjust nor unreasonable.” If the seven crore Mussulmans are partners in the Empire, I submit that their wish must be held to be all sufficient for refraining from punishing Turkey. It is beside the point to quote what Turkey did during the war. It has suffered for it. The Times inquires wherein Turkey has been treated worse than the other Powers. I thought that the fact was self-evident. Neither Germany nor Austria and Hungary has been treated in the same way that Turkey has been. The whole of the Empire has been reduced to the retention of a portion of its capital, as it were, to mock the Sultan and that too has been done under terms so humiliating that no self-respecting per
U||son much less a reigning sovereign can possibly accept.
U||The Times has endeavoured to make capital out of the fact that the representation does not examine the reason for Turkey not joining the Allies. Well there was no mystery about it. The fact of Russia being one of the Allies was enough to warn Turkey against joining them. With Russia knocking at the gate at the time of the war it was not an easy matter for Turkey to join the Allies. But Turkey had cause to suspect Great Britain herself. She knew that England had done no friendly turn to her during the Bulgarian War. She was hardly well served at the time of the war with Italy. It was still no doubt a bad choice. With the Musssalmans of India awakened and ready to support her, her statesmen might have relied upon Britain not being allowed to damage Turkey if she had remained with the Allies. But this is all wisdom after event. Turkey made a bad choice and she was punished for it. To humiliate her now is to ignore the Indian Mussulman sentiment. Britain may not do it and retain the loyalty of the awakened Mussu
U||lmans of India.
U||For “The Times” to say that the peace terms strictly follow the principle of self-determination is to throw dust in the eyes of its readers. Is it the principle of self-determination that has caused the cessation of Adrianople and Thrace to Greece? By what principle of self-determination has Smyrna been handed to Greece? Have the inhabitants of Thrace and Smyrna asked for Grecian tutelege?
U||I decline to believe that the Arabs like the disposition that has been made of them. Who is the King of Hedjaj and who is Emir Feisul? Have the Arabs elected these kings and chiefs? Do the Arabs like the Mandate being taken by England? By the time the whole thing is finished, the very name self-determination will stink in one’s nostrils. Already signs are not wanting to show that the Arabs, the Thracians and the Smyrnans are resenting their disposal. They may not like Turkish rule but they like the present arrangement less. They could have made their own honourable terms with Turkey but these self-determining people will now be held down by the ‘matchless might’ of the allied i.e., British forces. Britain had the straight course open to her of keeping the Turkish Empire intact and taking sufficient guarantees for good government. But her Prime Minister chose the crooked course of secret treaties, duplicity and hypocritical subterfuges.
U||There is still a way out. Let her treat India as a real partner. Let her call the true representatives of the Mussalmans. Let them go to Arabia and the other parts of the Turkish Empire and let her devise a scheme that would not humiliate Turkey, that would satisfy the just Muslim sentiment and that will secure honest self-determination for the races composing that Empire. If it was Canada, Australia or South Africa that had to be placated, Mr. Lloyd George would not have dared to ignore them. They have the power to secede. India has not. Let him no more insult India by calling her a partner, if her feelings count for naught. I invite The Times of India to reconsider its position and join an honourable agitation in which a high-souled people are seeking nothing but justice.
U||I do with all deference still suggest that the least that Lord Chelmsford can do is to resign if the sacred feelings of India’s sons are not to be consulted and respected by the Ministers. The Times is over-taxing the constitution when it suggests that as a constitutional Viceroy it is not open to Lord Chelmsford to go against the decision of his Majesty’s Ministers. It is certainly not open to a Viceroy to retain office and oppose ministerial decisions. But the constitution does allow a Viceroy to resign his high office when he is called upon to carry out decisions that are immoral as the peace terms are or like these terms are calculated to stir to their very depth the feelings of those whose affair he is administering for the time being.
U||THE MAHOMEDAN DECISION
U||The Khilafat meeting at Allahabad has unanimously reaffirmed the principle of non-co-operation and appointed an executive committee to lay down and enforce a detailed programme. This meeting was preceded by a joint Hindu-Mahomedan meeting at which Hindu leaders were invited to give their views. Mrs. Beasant, the Hon’ble Pandit Malaviyuji, the Hon’ble Dr. Sapru Motilal Nehru Chintamani and others were present at the meeting. It was a wise step on the part of the Khilafat Committee to invite Hindus representing all shades of thought to give them the benefit of their advice. Mrs. Besant and Dr. Sapru strongly dissuaded the Mahomedans present from the policy of non-co-operation. The other Hindu speakers made non-committal speeches. Whilst the other Hindu speakers approved of the principle of non-co-operation in theory, they saw many practical difficulties and they feared also complications arising from Mahomedans welcoming an Afghan invasion of India. The Mahomedan speakers gave the fullest and frankest assu
U||rances that they would fight to a man any invader who wanted to conquer India, but were equally frank in asserting that any invasion from without undertaken with a view to uphold the prestige of Islam and to vindicate justice would have their full sympathy if not their actual support. It is easy enough to understand and justify the Hindu caution. It is difficult to resist Mahomedan position. In my opinion, the best way to prevent India from becoming the battle ground between the forces of Islam and those of the English is for Hindus to make non-co-operation a complete and immediate success, and I have little doubt that if the Mahomedans remain true to their declared intention and are able to exercise self-restraint, and make sacrifices the Hindus will “play the game” and join them in the campaign of non-co-operation. I feel equally certain that the Hindus will not assist Mahomedans in promoting or bringing about an armed conflict between the British Government and their allies, and Afghanistan. British f
U||orces are too well organised to admit of any successful invasion of the Indian frontier. The only way, therefore, the Mahomedans can carry on an effective struggle on behalf of the honour of Islam is to take up non-co-operation in real earnest. It will not only be completely effective if it is adopted by the people on an extensive scale, but it will also provide full scope for individual conscience. If I cannot bear an injustice done by an individual or a corporation, and if I am directly or indirectly instrumental in upholding that individual or corporation, I must answer for it before my Maker, but I have done all it is humanly possible for me to do consistently with the moral code that refuses to injure even the wrong-doer, if I cease to support the injustice in the manner described above. In applying therefore such a great force there should be no haste, there should be no temper shown. Non-co-operation must be and remain absolutely a voluntary effort. The whole thing then depends upon Mahomedans themsel
U||ves. If they will but help themselves Hindu help will come and the Government, great and mighty though it is, will have to bend before this irresistible force. No Government can possibly withstand the bloodless opposition of a whole nation.
U||MR. ANDREWS’ DIFFICULTY
U||Mr. Andrews whose love for India is equalled only by his love for England and whose mission in life is to serve God, i.e., humanity through India, has contributed remarkable articles to the ‘Bombay Chronicle’ on the Khilafat movement. He has not spared England, France or Italy. He has shown how Turkey has been most unjustly dealt with and how the Prime Minister’s pledge has been broken. He has devoted the last article to an examination of Mr. Mahomed Ali’s letter to the Sultan and has come to the conclusion that Mr. Mahomed Ali’s statement of claim is at variance with the claim set forth in the latest Khilafat representation to the Viceroy which he wholly approves.
U||Mr. Andrews and I have discussed the question as fully as it was possible. He asked me publicly to define my own position more fully than I have done. His sole object in inviting discussion is to give strength to a cause which he holds as intrinsically just, and to gather round it the best opinion of Europe so that the allied powers and especially England may for very shame be obliged to revise the terms.
U||I gladly respond to Mr. Andrew’s invitation. I should clear the ground by stating that I reject any religious doctrine that does not appeal to reason and is in conflict with morality. I tolerate unreasonable religious sentiment when it is not immoral. I hold the Khilafat claim to be both just and reasonable and therefore it derives greater force because it has behind it the religious sentiment of the Mussalman world.
U||In my opinion Mr. Mahomed Ali’s statement is unexceptionable. It is no doubt clothed in diplomatic language. But I am not prepared to quarrel with the language so long as it is sound in substance.
U||Mr. Andrews considers that Mr. Mahomed Ali’s language goes to show that he would resist Armenian independence against the Armenians and the Arabian against the Arabs. I attach no such meaning to it. What he, the whole of Mussalmans and therefore I think also the Hindus resist is the shameless attempt of England and the other Powers under cover of self-determination to emasculate and dismember Turkey. If I understand the spirit of Islam properly, it is essentially republican in the truest sense of the term. Therefore if Armenia or Arabia desired independence of Turkey they should have it. In the case of Arabia, complete Arabian independence would mean transference of the Khilafat to an Arab chieftain. Arabia in that sense is a Mussulman trust, not purely Arabian. And the Arabs without ceasing to be Mussulman, could not hold Arabia against Muslim opinion. The Khalifa must be the custodian of the Holy places and therefore also the routes to them. He must be able to defend them against the whole world. And if 
U||an Arab chief arose who could better satisfy that test than the Sultan of Turkey, I have no doubt that he would be recognised as the Khalifa.
U||I have thus discussed the question academically. The fact is that neither the Mussulmans nor the Hindus believe in the English Ministerial word. They do not believe that the Arabs or the Armenians want complete independence of Turkey. That they want self-government is beyond doubt. Nobody disputes that claim. But nobody has ever ascertained that either the Arabs or the Armenians desire to do away with all connection, even nominal, with Turkey.
U||The solution of the question lies not in our academic discussion of the ideal position, it lies in an honest appointment of a mixed commission of absolutely independent Indian Mussulmans and Hindus and independent Europeans to investigate the real wish of the Armenians and the Arabs and then to come to a modus vivendi where by the claims of the nationality and those of Islam may be adjusted and satisfied.
U||It is common knowledge that Smyrna and Thrace including Adrianople have been dishonestly taken away from Turkey and that mandates have been unscrupulously established in Syria and Mesopotamia and a British nominee has been set up in Hedjaj under the protection of British guns. This is a position that is intolerable and unjust. Apart therefore from the questions of Armenia and Arabia, the dishonesty and hypocrisy that pollute the peace terms require to be instantaneously removed. It paves the way to an equitable solution of the question of Armenian and Arabian independence which in theory no one denies and which in practice may be easily guaranteed if only the wishes of the people concerned could with any degree of certainty be ascertained.
U||THE KHILAFAT AGITATION
U||A friend who has been listening to my speeches once asked me whether I did not come under the sedition section of the Indian Penal Code. Though I had not fully considered it, I told him that very probably I did and that I could not plead ‘not guilty’ if I was charged under it. For I must admit that I can pretend to no ‘affection’ for the present Government.
U||And my speeches are intended to create ‘dis-affection’ such that the people might consider it a shame to assist or co-operate with a Government that had forfeited all title to confidence, respect or support.
U||I draw no distinction between the Imperial and the Indian Government. The latter has accepted, on the Khilafat, the policy imposed upon it by the former. And in the Punjab case the former has endorsed the policy of terrorism and emasculation of a brave people initiated by the latter. British ministers have broken their pledged word and wantonly wounded the feelings of the seventy million Mussulmans of India. Innocent men and women were insulted by the insolent officers of the Punjab Government. Their wrongs not only remain unrighted but the very officers who so cruelly subjected them to barbarous humiliation retain office under the Government.
U||When at Amritsar last year I pleaded with all the earnestness I could command for co-operation with the Government and for response to the wishes expressed in the Royal Proclamation. I did so because I honestly believed that, a new era was about to begin, and that the old spirit of fear, distrust and consequent terrorism was about to give place to the new spirit of respect, trust and goodwill. I sincerely believed that the Mussulman sentiment would be placated and that the officers that had misbehaved during the Martial Law regime in the Punjab would be at least dismissed and the people would be otherwise made to feel that a Government that had always been found quick (and mighty) to punish popular excesses would not fail to punish its agents’ misdeeds. But to my amazement and dismay I have discovered that the present representatives of the Empire have become dishonest and unscrupulous. They have no real regard for the wishes of the people of India and they count Indian honour as of little consequence.
U||I can no longer retain affection for a Government so evilly manned as it is now-a-days. And for me, it is humiliating to retain my freedom and be witness to the continuing wrong. Mr. Montagu however is certainly right in threatening me with deprivation of my liberty if I persist in endangering the existence of the Government. For that must be the result if my activity bears fruit. My only regret is that inasmuch as Mr. Montagu admits my past services, he might have perceived that there must be something exceptionally bad in the Government if a well-wisher like me could no longer give his affection to it. It was simpler to insist on justice being done to the Mussalmans and to the Punjab than to threaten me with punishment so that the injustice might be perpetuated. Indeed I fully expect it will be found that even in promoting disaffection towards an unjust Government I had rendered greater services to the Empire than I am already credited with.
U||At the present moment, however, the duty of those who approve my activity is clear. They ought on no account to resent the deprivation of my liberty, should the Government of India deem it to be their duty to take it away. A citizen has no right to resist such restriction imposed in accordance with the laws of the State to which he belongs. Much less have those who sympathise with him. In my case there can be no question of sympathy. For I deliberately oppose the Government to the extent of trying to put its very existence in jeopardy. For my supporters, therefore, it must be a moment of joy when I am imprisoned. It means the beginning of success if only the supporters continue the policy for which I stand. If the Government arrest me, they would do so in order to stop the progress of Non-co-operation which I preach. It follows that if Non-co-operation continues with unabated vigour, even after my arrest, the Government must imprison others or grant the people’s wish in order to gain their co-operation. An
U||y eruption of violence on the part of the people even under provocation would end in disaster. Whether therefore it is I or any one else who is arrested during the campaign, the first condition of success is that there must be no resentment shown against it. We cannot imperil the very existence of a Government and quarrel with its attempt to save itself by punishing those who place it in danger.
U||HIJARAT AND ITS MEANING
U||India is a continent. Its articulate thousands know what its inarticulate millions are doing or thinking. The Government and the educated Indians may think that the Khilafat movement is merely a passing phase. The millions of Mussalmans think otherwise. The flight of the Mussalmans is growing apace. The newspapers contain paragraphs in out of the way corners informing the readers that a special train containing a barrister with sixty women, forty children including twenty sucklings, all told 765, have left for Afghanistan. They were cheered en route. They were presented with cash, edibles and other things, and were joined by more Muhajarins on the way. No fanatical preaching by Shaukatali can make people break up and leave their homes for an unknown land. There must be an abiding faith in them. That it is better for them to leave a State which has no regard for their religious sentiment and face a beggar’s life than to remain in it even though it may be in a princely manner. Nothing but pride of power can 
U||blind the Government of India to the scene that is being enacted before it.
U||But there is yet another side to the movement. Here are the facts as stated in the following Government Communique dated 10th July 1920:—
U||An unfortunate affair in connection with the Mahajarin occurred on the 8th instant at Kacha Garhi between Peshawar and Jamrud. The following are the facts as at present reported. Two members of a party of the Mahajarins proceeding by train to Jamrud were detected by the British military police travelling without tickets. Altercation ensued at Islamia College Station, but the train proceeded to Kacha Garhi. An attempt was made to evict these Mahajarins, whereupon the military police were attacked by a crowd of some forty Mahajarins and the British officer who intervened was seriously wounded with a spade. A detachment of Indian troops at Kacha Garhi thereupon fired two or three shots at the Mahajarin for making murderous assault on the British officer. One Mahajarin was killed and one wounded and three arrested. Both the military and the police were injured. The body of the Mahajarin was despatched to Peshawar and buried on the morning of the 9th. This incident has caused considerable excitement in Peshawar C
U||ity, and the Khilafat Hijrat Committee are exercising restraining influence. Shops were closed on the morning of the 9th. A full enquiry has been instituted.
U||Now Peshawar to Jamrud is a matter of a few miles. It was clearly the duty of the military not to attempt to pull out the ticketless Mahajarins for the sake of a few annas. But they actually attempted force. Intervention by the rest of the party was a foregone conclusion. An altercation ensued. A British officer was attacked with a spade. Firing and a death of a Mahajarin was the result. Has British prestige been enhanced by the episode? Why have not the Government put tactful officers in charge at the frontier, whilst a great religious emigration is in progress? The action of the military will pass from tongue to tongue throughout India and the Mussalman world around, will not doubt be unconsciously and even consciously exaggerated in the passage and the feeling bitter as it already is will grow in bitterness. The Communique says that the Government are making further inquiry. Let us hope that it will be full and that better arrangements will be made to prevent a repetition of what appears to have been a th
U||oughtless act on the part of the military.
U||And may I draw the attention of those who are opposing non-co-operation that unless they find out a substitute they should either join the non-co-operation movement or prepare to face a disorganised subterranean upheaval whose effect no one can foresee and whose spread it would be impossible to check or regulate?
U||III. THE PUNJAB WRONGS
U||POLITICAL FREEMASONRY
U||Freemasonry is a secret brotherhood which has more by its secret and iron rules than by its service to humanity obtained a hold upon some of the best minds. Similarly there seems to be some secret code of conduct governing the official class in India before which the flower of the great British nation fall prostrate and unconsciously become instruments of injustice which as private individuals they would be ashamed of perpetrating. In no other way is it possible for one to understand the majority report of the Hunter Committee, the despatch of the Government of India, and the reply thereto of the Secretary of State for India. In spite of the energetic protests of a section of the Press to the personnel of the committee, it might be said that on the whole the public were prepared to trust it especially as it contained three Indian members who could fairly be claimed to be independent. The first rude shock to this confidence was delivered by the refusal of Lord Hunter’s Committee to accept the very moderate 
U||and reasonable demand of the Congress Committee that the imprisoned Punjab leaders might be allowed to appear before it to instruct Counsel. Any doubt that might have been left in the mind of any person has been dispelled by the report of the majority of that committee. The result has justified the attitude of the Congress Committee. The evidence collected by it shows what lord Hunter’s Committee purposely denied itself.
U||The minority report stands out like an oasis in a desert. The Indian members deserve the congratulation of their countrymen for having dared to do their duty in the face of heavy odds. I wish that they had refused to associate themselves even in a modified manner with the condemnation of the civil disobedience form of Satyagraha. The defiant spirit of the Delhi mob on the 30th March 1919 can hardly be used for condemning a great spiritual movement which is admittedly and manifestly intended to restrain the violent tendencies of mobs and to replace criminal lawlessness by civil disobedience of authority, when it has forfeited all title to respect. On the 30th March civil disobedience had not even been started. Almost every great popular demonstration has been hitherto attended all the world over by a certain amount of lawlessness. The demonstration of 30th March and 6th April could have been held under any other aegis us under that of Satyagrah. I hold that without the advent of the spirit of civility and ord
U||erliness the disobedience would have taken a much more violent form than it did even at Delhi. It was only the wonderfully quick acceptance by the people of the principle of Satyagrah that effectively checked the spread of violence throughout the length and breadth of India. And even to-day it is not the memory of the black barbarity of General Dyer that is keeping the undoubted restlessness among the people from breaking forth into violence. The hold that Satyagrah has gained on the people—it may be even against their will—is curbing the forces of disorder and violence. But I must not detain the reader on a defence of Satyagrah against unjust attacks. If it has gained a foothold in India, it will survive much fiercer attacks than the one made by the majority of the Hunter Committee and somewhat supported by the minority. Had the majority report been defective only in this direction and correct in every other there would have been nothing but praise for it. After all Satyagrah is a new experiment in poli
U||tical field. And a hasty attributing to it of any popular disorder would have been pardonable.
U||The universally pronounced adverse judgment upon the report and the despatches rests upon far more painful revelations. Look at the manifestly laboured defence of every official act of inhumanity except where condemnation could not be avoided through the impudent admissions made by the actors themselves; look at the special pleading introduced to defend General Dyer even against himself; look at the vain glorification of Sir Michael O’Dwyer although it was his spirit that actuated every act of criminality on the part of the subordinates; look at the deliberate refusal to examine his wild career before the events of April. His acts were an open book of which the committee ought to have taken judicial notices. Instead of accepting everything that the officials had to say, the Committee’s obvious duty was to tax itself to find out the real cause of the disorders. It ought to have gone out of its way to search out the inwardness of the events. Instead of patiently going behind the hard crust of official docu
U||ments, the Committee allowed itself to be guided with criminal laziness by mere official evidence. The report and the despatches, in my humble opinion, constitute an attempt to condone official lawlessness. The cautious and half-hearted condemnation pronounced upon General Dyer’s massacre and the notorious crawling order only deepens the disappointment of the reader as he goes through page after page of thinly disguised official whitewash. I need, however, scarcely attempt any elaborate examination of the report or the despatches which have been so justly censured by the whole national press whether of the moderate or the extremist hue. The point to consider is how to break down this secret—be the secrecy over so unconscious—conspiracy to uphold official iniquity. A scandal of this magnitude cannot be tolerated by the nation, if it is to preserve its self-respect and become a free partner in the Empire. The All-India Congress Committee has resolved upon convening a special session of the Congress for t
U||he purpose of considering, among other things, the situation arising from the report. In my opinion the time has arrived when we must cease to rely upon mere petition to Parliament for effective action. Petitions will have value, when the nation has behind it the power to enforce its will. What power then have we? When we are firmly of opinion that grave wrong has been done us and when after an appeal to the highest authority we fail to secure redress, there must be some power available to us for undoing the wrong. It is true that in the vast majority of cases it is the duty of a subject to submit to wrongs on failure of the usual procedure, so long as they do not affect his vital being. But every nation and every individual has the right and it is their duty, to rise against an intolerable wrong. I do not believe in armed risings. They are a remedy worse than the disease sought to be cured. They are a token of the spirit of revenge and impatience and anger. The method of violence cannot do good in the long 
U||run. Witness the effect of the armed rising of the allied powers against Germany. Have they not become even like the Germans, as the latter have been depicted to us by them?
U||We have a better method. Unlike that of violence it certainly involves the exercise of restraint and patience: but it requires also resoluteness of will. This method is to refuse to be party to the wrong. No tyrant has ever yet succeeded in his purpose without carrying the victim with him, it may be, as it often is, by force. Most people choose rather to yield to the will of the tyrant than to suffer for the consequences of resistance. Hence does terrorism form part of the stock-in-trade of the tyrant. But we have instances in history where terrorism has failed to impose the terrorist’s will upon his victim. India has the choice before her now. If then the acts of the Punjab Government be an insufferable wrong, if the report of Lord Hunter’s Committee and the two despatches be a greater wrong by reason of their grievous condonation of those acts, it is clear that we must refuse to submit to this official violence. Appeal the Parliament by all means, if necessary, but if the Parliament fails us and if we 
U||are worthy to call ourselves a nation, we must refuse to uphold the Government by withdrawing co-operation from it.
U||THE DUTY OF THE PUNJABEE
U||The Allahabad Leader deserves to be congratulated for publishing the correspondence on Mr. Bosworth Smith who was one of the Martial Law officers against whom the complaints about persistent and continuous ill-treatment were among the bitterest. It appears from the correspondence that Mr. Bosworth Smith has received promotion instead of dismissal. Sometime before Martial Law Mr. Smith appears to have been degraded. “He has since been restored,” says the Leader correspondent, “to his position of a Deputy Commissioner of the second grade from which he was degraded and also been invested with power under section 30 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Since his arrival, the poor Indian population of the town of Amhala Cantonment has been living under a regime of horror and tyranny.” The correspondent adds: “I use both these words deliberately for conveying precisely what they mean.” I cull a few passage from this illuminating letter to illustrate the meaning of horror and tyranny. “In private complaint
U||s he never takes the statement of the complainant. It is taken down by the reader when the court rises and got signed by the magistrate the following day. Whether the report received (upon such complaints) is favourable to the complainant or unfavourable to him, it is never ready by the magistrate, and complaints are dismissed without proper trial. This is the fate of private complaints. Now as regards police chellans. Pleaders for the accused are not allowed to interview under trial prisoners in police custody. They are not allowed to cross-examine prosecution witnesses.... Prosecution witnesses are examined with leading questions.... Thus a whole prosecution story is put into the mouth of police, witnesses for the defence though called in are not allowed to be examined by the defence counsel.... The accused is silenced if he picks up courage to say anything in defence.... Any Cantonment servant can write down the name of any citizen of the Cantonment on a chit of paper and ask him to appear the next day in
U|| court. This is a summons.... If any one does not appear in court who is thus ordered, criminal warrants of arrest are issued against him.” There is much more of this style in the letter which is worth producing, but I have given enough to illustrate the writer’s meaning. Let me turn for a while to this official’s record during Martial Law. He is the official who tried people in batches and convicted them after a farcical trial. Witnesses have deposed to his having assembled people, having asked them to give false evidence, having removed women’s veils, called them ‘flies, bitches, she-asses’ and having spat upon them. He it was who subjected the innocent pleaders of Shokhupura indescribable persecution. Mr. Andrews personally investigated complaints against this official and came to the conclusion that no official had behaved worse than Mr. Smith. He gathered the people of Shokhupura, humiliated them in a variety of ways, called them ‘suvarlog,’ ‘gandi mukkhi.’ His evidence before the Hu
U||nter Commission betrays his total disregard for truth and this is the officer who, if the correspondent in question has given correct facts, has been promoted. The question however is why, he is at all in Government service and why he has not been tried for assaulting and abusing innocent men and women.
U||I notice a desire for the impeachment of General Dyer and Sir Michael O’Dwyer. I will not stop to examine whether the course is feasible. I was sorry to find Mr. Shastriar joining this cry for the prosecution of General Dyer. If the English people will willingly do so, I would welcome such prosecution as a sign of their strong disapproval of the Jallianwalla Bagh atrocity, but I would certainly not spend a single farthing in a vain pursuit after the conviction of this man. Surely the public has received sufficient experience of the English mind. Practically the whole English Press has joined the conspiracy to screen these offenders against humanity. I would not be party to make heroes of them by joining the cry for prosecution private or public. If I can only persuade India to insist upon their complete dismissal, I should be satisfied. But more than the dismissal, of Sir Michael O’Dwyer and General Dyer, is necessary the peremptory dismissal, if not a trial, of Colonel O’Brien, Mr. Bosworth Smith, Rai
U|| Shri Ram and others mentioned in the Congress Sub-Committee’s Report. Bad as General Dyer is I consider Mr. Smith to be infinitely worse and his crimes to be far more serious than the massacre of Jallianwalla Bugh. General Dyer sincerely believed that it was a soldierly act to terrorise people by shooting them. But Mr. Smith was wantonly cruel, vulgar and debased. If all the facts that have been deposed to against him are true, there is not a spark of humanity about him. Unlike General Dyer he lacks the courage to confirm what he has done and he wriggles when challenged. This officer remains free to inflict himself upon people who have done no wrong to him, and who is permitted to disgrace the rule he represents for the time being.
U||What is the Punjab doing? Is it not the duty of the Punjabis not to rest until they have secured the dismissal of Mr. Smith and the like? The Punjab leaders have been discharged in vain if they will not utilise the liberty they have received, in order to purge the administration of Messrs. Bosworth Smith and Company. I am sure that if they will only begin a determined agitation they will have the whole India by their side. I venture to suggest to them that the best way to qualify for sending General Dyer to the gallows is to perform the easier and the more urgent duty of arresting the mischief still continued by the officials against whom they have assisted in collecting overwhelming evidence.
U||GENERAL DYER
U||The Army Council has found General Dyer guilty of error of judgment and advised that he should not receive any office under the Crown. Mr. Montagu has been unsparing in his criticism of General Dyer’s conduct. And yet somehow or other I cannot help feeling that General Dyer is by no means the worst offender. His brutality is unmistakable. His abject and unsoldier-like cowardice is apparent in every line of his amazing defence before the Army Council. He has called an unarmed crowd of men and children—mostly holiday-makers—‘a rebel army.’ He believes himself to be the saviour of the Punjab in that he was able to shoot down like rabbits men who were penned in an inclosure. Such a man is unworthy of being considered a soldier. There was no bravery in his action. He ran no risk. He shot without the slightest opposition and without warning. This is not an ‘error of judgement.’ It is paralysis of it in the face of fancied danger. It is proof of criminal incapacity and heartlessness. But the fury that
U|| has been spent upon General Dyer is, I am sure, largely misdirected. No doubt the shooting was ‘frightful,’ the loss of innocent life deplorable. But the slow torture, degradation and emasculation that followed was much worse, more calculated, malicious and soul-killing, and the actors who performed the deeds deserve greater condemnation that General Dyer for the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre. The latter merely destroyed a few bodies but the others tried to kill the soul of a nation. Who ever talks of Col. Frank Johnson who was by far the worst offender? He terrorised guiltless Lahore, and by his merciless orders set the tone to the whole of the Martial Law officers. But what I am concerned with is not even Col. Johnson. The first business of the people of the Punjab and of India is to rid the service of Col O’Brien, Mr. Bosworth Smith, Rai Shri Ram and Mr. Malik Khan. They are still retained in the service. Their guilt is as much proved as that of General Dyer. We shall have failed in our duty if the co
U||ndemnation pronounced upon General Dyer produces a sense of satisfaction and the obvious duty of purging the administration in the Punjab is neglected. That task will not be performed by platform rhetoric or resolutions merely. Stern action is required on out part if we are to make any headway with ourselves and make any impression upon the officials that they are not to consider themselves as masters of the people but as their trusties and servants who cannot hold office if they misbehave themselves and prove unworthy of the trust reposed in them.
U||THE PUNJAB SENTENCES
U||The commissioners appointed by the Congress Punjab Sub Committee have in their report accused His Excellency the Viceroy of criminal want of imagination. His Excellency’s refusal to commute two death sentences out of five is a fine illustration of the accusation. The rejection of the appeal by the Privy Council no more proves the guilt of the condemned than their innocence would have been proved by quashing the proceedings before the Martial Law Tribunal. Moreover, these cases clearly come under the Royal Proclamation in accordance with its interpretation by the Punjab Government. The murders in Amritsar were not due to any private quarrel between the murderers and their victims. The offence grave, though it was, was purely political and committed under excitement. More than full reparation has been taken for the murders and arson. In the circumstances commonsense dictates reduction of the death sentences. The popular belief favours the view that the condemned men are innocent and have not had a fair trial
U||. The execution has been so long delayed that hanging at this stage would give a rude shock to Indian society. Any Viceroy with imagination would have at once announced commutation of the death sentences—not so Lord Chelmsford. In his estimation, evidently, the demands of justice will not be satisfied if at least some of the condemned men are not hanged. Public feeling with him counts for nothing. We shall still hope that, either the Viceroy or Mr. Montagu will commute the death sentences.
U||But if the Government will grievously err, if they carry out the sentences, the people will equally err if they give way to anger or grief over the hanging if it has unfortunately to take plane. Before we become a nation possessing an effective voice in the councils of nations, we must be prepared to contemplate with equanimity, not a thousand murders of innocent men and women but many thousands before we attain a status in the world that, shall not be surpassed by any nation. We hope therefore that all concerned will take rather than lose heart and treat hanging as an ordinary affair of life.
U||[Since the above was in type, we have received cruel news. At last H.E. the Viceroy has mercilessly given the rude shock to Indian society. It is now for the latter to take heart in spite of the unkindest cut.—Ed. Y.I.]
U||IV. SWARAJ
U||SWARAJ IN ONE YEAR
U||Much laughter has been indulged in at my expense for having told the Congress audience at Calcutta that if there was sufficient response to my programme of non-co-operation Swaraj would be attained in one year. Some have ignored my condition and laughed because of the impossibility of getting Swaraj anyhow within one year. Others have spelt the ‘if’ in capitals and suggested that if ‘ifs’ were permissible in argument, any absurdity could be proved to be a possibility. My proposition however is based on a mathematical calculation. And I venture to say that true Swaraj is a practical impossibility without due fulfilment of my conditions. Swaraj means a state such that we can maintain our separate existence without the presence of the English. If it is to be a partnership, it must be partnership at will. There can be no Swaraj without our feeling and being the equals of Englishmen. To-day we feel that we are dependent upon them for our internal and external security, for an armed peace between the Hindu
U||s and the Mussulmans, for our education and for the supply of daily wants, nay, even for the settlement of our religious squabbles. The Rajahs are dependent upon the British for their powers and the millionaires for their millions. The British know our helplessness and Sir Thomas Holland cracks jokes quite legitimately at the expense of non-co-operationists. To get Swaraj then is to get rid of our helplessness. The problem is no doubt stupendous even as it is for the fabled lion who having been brought up in the company of goats found it impossible to feel that he was a lion. As Tolstoy used to put it, mankind often laboured under hypnotism. Under its spell continuously we feel the feeling of helplessness. The British themselves cannot be expected to help us out of it. On the contrary, they din into our ears that we shall be fit to govern ourselves only by slow educative processes. The “Times” suggested that if we boycott the councils we shall lose the opportunity of a training in Swaraj. I have no doubt
U|| that there are many who believe what the “Times” says. It even resorts to a falsehood. It audaciously says that Lord Milner’s Mission listened to the Egyptians only when they were ready to lift the boycott of the Egyptian Council. For me the only training in Swaraj we need is the ability to defend ourselves against the whole world and to live our natural life in perfect freedom even though it may be full of defects. Good Government is no substitute for self-Government. The Afghans have a bad Government but it is self-Government. I envy them. The Japanese learnt the art through a sea of blood. And if we to-day had the power to drive out the English by superior brute force, we would be counted their superiors, and in spite of our inexperience in debating at the Council table or in holding executive offices, we would be held fit to govern ourselves. For brute force is the only test the west has hitherto recognised. The Germans were defeated not because they were necessarily in the wrong, but because the 
U||allied Powers were found to possess greater brute strength. In the end therefore India must either learn the art of war which the British will not teach her or, she must follow her own way of discipline and self-sacrifice through non-co-operation. It is as amazing as it is humiliating that less than one hundred-thousand white men should be able to rule three hundred and fifteen million Indians. They do so somewhat undoubtedly by force, but more by securing our co-operation in a thousand ways and making us more and more helpless and dependent on them as time goes forward. Let us not mistake reformed councils, more lawcourts and even governorships for real freedom or power. They are but subtler methods of emasculation. The British cannot rule us by mere force. And so they resort to all means, honourable and dishonourable, in order to retain their hold on India. They want India’s billions and they want India’s man power for their imperialistic greed. If we refuse to supply them with men and money, we achiev
U||e our goal, namely, Swaraj, equality, manliness.
U||The cup of our humiliation was filled during the closing scenes in the Viceregal Council. Mr. Shustri could not move his resolution on the Punjab. The Indian victims of Jullianwala received Rs. 1,250, the English victims of mob-frenzy received lakhs. The officials who were guilty of crimes against those whose servants they were, were reprimanded. And the councillors were satisfied. If India were powerful, India would not have stood this addition of insult, to her injury.
U||I do not blame the British. If we were weak in numbers as they are, we too would perhaps have resorted to the same methods as they are now employing. Terrorism and deception are weapons not of the strong but of the weak. The British are weak in numbers we are weak in spite of our numbers. The result is that each is dragging the other down. It is common experience that Englishmen lose in character after residence in India and that Indians lose in courage and manliness by contact with Englishmen. This process of weakening is good neither for us, two nations, nor for the world.
U||But if we Indians take care of ourselves the English and the rest of the world would take care of themselves. Our contributions to the world’s progress must therefore consist in setting our own house in order.
U||Training in arms for the present is out of the question. I go a step further and believe that India has a better mission for the world. It is within her to show that she can achieve her destiny by pure self-sacrifice, i.e., self-purification. This can be done only by non-co-operation. And non-co-operation is possible only when those who commenced to co-operate being the process of withdrawal. If we can but free ourselves from the threefold maya of Government-controlled schools, Government law-courts and legislative councils, and truly control our own education regulate our disputes and be indifferent to their legislation, we are ready to govern ourselves and we are only then ready to ask the government servants, whether civil or military, to resign, and the tax-payers to suspend payment of taxes.
U||And is it such an impracticable proposition to expect parents to withdraw their children from schools and colleges and establish their own institutions or to ask lawyers to suspend their practice and devote their whole time attention to national service against payment where necessary, of their maintenance, or to ask candidates for councils not to enter councils and lend their passive or active assistance to the legislative machinery through which all control is exercised. The movement of non-co-operation is nothing but an attempt to isolate the brute force of the British from all the trappings under which it is hidden and to show that brute force by itself cannot for one single moment hold India.
U||But I frankly confess that, until the three conditions mentioned by me are fulfilled, there is no Swaraj. We may not go on taking our college degrees, taking thousands of rupees monthly from clients for cases which can be finished in five minutes and taking the keenest delight in wasting national time on the council floor and still expect to gain national self-respect.
U||The last though not the least important part of the Maya still remains to be considered. That is Swadeshi. Had we not abandoned Swadeshi, we need not have been in the present fallen state. If we would get rid of the economic slavery, we must manufacture our own cloth and at the present moment only by hand-spinning and hand weaving.
U||All this means discipline, self-denial, self-sacrifice, organising ability, confidence and courage. If we show this in one year among the classes that to-day count, and make public opinion, we certainly gain Swaraj within one year. If I am told that even we who lead have not these qualities in us, there certainly will never be Swaraj for India, but then we shall have no right to blame the English for what they are doing. Our salvation and its time are solely dependent upon us.
U||BRITISH RULE—AN EVIL
U||The Interpreter is however more to the point in asking, “Does Mr. Gandhi hold without hesitation or reserve that British rule in India is altogether an evil and that the people of India are to be taught so to regard it? He must hold it to be so evil that the wrongs it does outweigh the benefit it confers, for only so is non-co-operation to be justified at the bar of conscience or of Christ.” My answer is emphatically in the affirmative. So long as I believed that the sum total of the energy of the British Empire was good, I clung to it despite what I used to regard as temporary aberrations. I am not sorry for having done so. But having my eyes opened, it would be sin for me to associate myself with the Empire unless it purges itself of its evil character. I write this with sorrow and I should be pleased if I discovered that I was in error and that my present attitude was a reaction. The continuous financial drain, the emasculation of the Punjab and the betrayal of the Muslim sentiment constitute, in my h
U||umble opinion, a threefold robbery of India. ‘The blessings of pax Britanica’ I reckon, therefore, to be a curse. We would have at least remained like the other nations brave men and women, instead of feeling as we do so utterly helpless, if we had no British Rule imposing on us an armed peace. ‘The blessing’ of roads and railways is a return no self-respecting nation would accept for its degradation. ‘The blessing’ of education is proving one of the greatest obstacles in our progress towards freedom.
U||A MOVEMENT OF PURIFICATION
U||The fact is that non-co-operation by reason of its non-violence has become a religious and purifying movement. It is daily bringing strength to the nation, showing it its weak spots and the remedy for removing them. It is a movement of self-reliance. It is the mightiest force for revolutionising opinion and stimulating thought. It is a movement of self-imposed suffering and therefore possesses automatic checks against extravagance or impatience. The capacity of the nation for suffering regulates its advance towards freedom. It isolates the force of evil by refraining from participation in it, in any shape or form.
U||WHY WAS INDIA LOST?
U||[A dialog between the Reader and Editor,—Indian Home Rule].
U||Reader: You have said much about civilisation—enough to make me ponder over it. I do not know what I should adopt and what I should avoid from the nations of Europe. but one question comes to my lips immediately. If civilisation is a disease, and if it has attacked England why has she been able to take India, and why is she able to retain it?
U||Editor: Your question is not very difficult to answer, and we shall presently be able to examine the true nature of Swaraj; for I am aware that I have still to answer that question. I will, however, take up your previous question. The English have not taken India; we have given it to them. They are not in India because of their strength, but because we keep them. Let us now see whether these positions can be sustained. They came to our country originally for the purpose of trade. Recall the Company Bahadur. Who made it Bahadur? They had not the slightest intention at the time of establishing a kingdom. Who assisted the Company’s officers? Who was tempted at the sight of their silver? Who bought their goods? History testifies that we did all this. In order to become rich all at once, we welcomed the Company’s officers with open arms. We assisted them. If I am in the habit of drinking Bhang, and a seller thereof sells it to me, am I to blame him or myself? By blaming the seller shall I be able to avoid the
U|| habit? And, if a particular retailer is driven away will not another take his place? A true servant of India will have to go to the root of the matter. If an excess of food has caused me indigestion I will certainly not avoid it by blaming water. He is a true physician who probes the cause of disease and, if you pose as a physician for the disease of India, you will have to find out its true cause.
U||Reader: You are right. Now, I think you will not have to argue much with me to drive your conclusions home. I am impatient to know your further views. We are now on a most interesting topic. I shall, therefore, endeavour to follow your thought, and stop you when I am in doubt.
U||Editor: I am afraid that, in spite of your enthusiasm, as we proceed further we shall have differences of opinion. Nevertheless, I shall argue only when you will stop me. We have already seen that the English merchants were able to get a footing in India because we encouraged them. When our princes fought among themselves, they sought the assistance of Company Bahadar. That corporation was versed alike in commerce and war. It was unhampered by questions of morality. Its object was to increase its commerce and to make money. It accepted our assistance, and increased the number of its warehouses. To protect the latter it employed an army which was utilised by us also. Is it not then useless to blame the English for what we did at that time? The Hindus and the Mahomedans were at daggers drawn. This, too, gave the Company its opportunity, and thus we created the circumstances that gave the Company its control over India. Hence it is truer to say that we gave India to the English than that India was lost.
U||Reader: Will you now tell me how they are able to retain India?
U||Editor: The causes that gave them India enable them to retain it. Some Englishmen state that they took, and they hold, India by the sword. Both these statements are wrong. The sword is entirely useless for holding India. We alone keep them. Napoleon is said to have described the English as a nation of shop keepers. It is a fitting description. They hold whatever dominions they have for the sake of their commerce. Their army and their navy are intended to protect it. When the Transvaal offered no such attractions, the late Mr. Gladstone discovered that it was no right for the English to hold it. When it became a paying proposition, resistance led to war. Mr. Chamberlain soon discovered that England enjoyed a suzerainty over the Transvaal. It is related that some one asked the late President Kruger whether there was gold in the moon? He replied that it was highly unlikely, because, if there were, the English would have annexed it. Many problems can be solved by remembering that money is their God. Then it foll
U||ows that we keep the English in India for our base self-interest. We like their commerce, they please us by their subtle methods, and get what they want from us. To blame them for this is to perpetuate their power. We further strengthen their hold by quarrelling amongst ourselves. If you accept the above statements, it is proved that the English entered India for the purposes of trade. They remain in it for the same purpose, and we help them to do so. Their arms and ammunition are perfectly useless. In this connection, I remind you that it is the British flag which is waving in Japan, and not the Japanese. The English have a treaty with Japan for the sake of their commerce and you will see that, if they can manage it, their commerce will greatly expand in that country. They wish to convert the whole word into a vast market for their goods. That they cannot do so is true, but the blame will not be theirs. They will leave no stone unturned to reach the goal.
U||SWARAJ MY IDEAL
U||The following is a fairly full report of Mr. Gandhi’s important speech at Calcutta on the 13th December 1920:—
U||The very fact, that so many of you cannot understand Hindi which is bound to be the National medium of expression throughout Hindustan in gatherings of Indians belonging to different parts of the land, shows the depth of the degradation to which we have sunk, and points to the supreme necessity of the non-co-operation movement which is intended to lift us out of that condition. This Government has been instrumental in degrading this great nation in various ways, and it is impossible to be free from it without co-operation amongst ourselves which is in turn impossible without a national medium of expression.
U||But I am not here to day to plead for the medium. I am to plead for the acceptance by the country of the programme of non-violent, progressive non-co-operation. Now all the words that I have used here are absolutely necessary and the two adjectives ‘progressive’ and ‘non-violent’ are integral part of a whole. With me non-violence is part of my religion, a matter of creed. But with the great number of Mussalmans non-violence is a policy, with thousand, if not millions of Hindus, it is equally a matter of policy. But whether it is a creed or a policy, it is utterly impossible for you to finish the programme for the enfranchisement of the millions of India, without recognising the necessity and the value of non-violence. Violence may for a moment avail to secure a certain measure of success but it could not in the long run achieve any appreciable result. On the other hand all violence would prove destructive to the honour and self-respect of the nation. The blue books issued by the Government of India s
U||how that inasmuch as we have used violence, military expenditure has gone up, not proportionately but in geometrical progression. The bonds of our slavery have been forged all the stronger for our having offered violence. And the whole history of British rule in India is a demonstration of the fact that we have never been able to offer successful violence. Whilst therefore I say that rather than have the yoke of a Government that has so emasculated us, I would welcome violence. I would urge with all the emphasis that I can command that India will never be able to regain her own by methods of violence.
U||Lord Ronaldshay who has done me the honour of reading my booklet on Home Rule has warned my countrymen against engaging themselves in a struggle for a Swaraj such as is described in that booklet. Now though I do not want to withdraw a single word of it, I would say to you on this occasion that I do not ask India to follow out to-day the methods prescribed in my booklet. If they could do that they would have Home Rule not in a year but in a day, and India by realising that ideal wants to acquire an ascendancy over the rest of the world. But it must remain a day dream more or less for the time being. What I am doing to-day is that I am giving the country a pardonable programme not the abolition of law courts, posts, telegraphs and of railways but for the attainment of Parliamentary Swarja. I am telling you to do that so long as we do not isolate ourselves from this Government, we are co-operating with it through schools, law courts and councils, through service civil and military and payment of taxes and forei
U||gn trade.
U||The moment this fact is realised and non-co-operation is effected, this Government must totter to pieces. If I know that the masses were prepared for the whole programme at once, I would not delay in putting it at once to work. It is not possible at the present moment, to prevent the masses from bursting out into wrath against those who come to execute the law, it is not possible, that the military would lay down their arms without the slightest violence. If that were possible to-day, I would propose all the stages of non-co-operation to be worked simultaneously. But we have not secured that control over the masses, we have uselessly frittered away precious years of the nation’s life in mastering a language which we need least for winning our liberty; we have frittered away all those years in learning liberty from Milton and Shakespeare, in deriving inspiration from the pages of Mill, whilst liberty could be learnt at our doors. We have thus succeeded in isolating ourselves from the masses: we have been we
U||sternised. We have failed these 35 years to utilise our education in order to permeate the masses. We have sat upon the pedestal and from there delivered harangues to them in a language they do not understand and we see to-day that we are unable to conduct large gatherings in a disciplined manner. And discipline is the essence of success. Here is therefore one reason why I have introduced the word ‘progressive’ in the non-co-operation Resolution. Without any impertinence I may say that I understand the mass mind better than any one amongst the educated Indians. I contend that the masses are not ready for suspension of payment of taxes. They have not yet learnt sufficient self-control. If I was sure of non-violence on their part I would ask them to suspend payment to-day and not waste a single moment of the nations time. With me the liberty of India has become a passion. Liberty of Islam is as dear to me. I would not therefore delay a moment if I found that the whole of the programme could be enforced at 
U||once.
U||It grieves me to miss the faces of dear and revered leaders in this assembly. We miss here the trumpet voice of Surendranath Banorji, who has rendered inestimable service to the country. And though we stand as poles asunder to-day, though we may have sharp differences with him, we must express them with becoming restraint. I do not ask you to give up a single iota of principle. I urge non-violence in language and in deed. If non-violence is essential in our dealings with Government, it is more essential in our dealings with our leaders. And it grieves me deeply to hear of recent instances of violence reported to have been used in East Bongal against our own people. I was pained to hear that the ears of a man who had voted at the recent elections had been cut, and night soil had been thrown into the bed of a man who had stood as a candidate. Non-co-operation is never going to succeed in this way. It will not succeed unless we create an atmosphere of perfect freedom, unless we prize our opponents liberty as mu
U||ch as our own. The liberty of faith, conscience, thought and action which we claim for ourselves must be conceded equally to others. Non co-operation is a process of purification and we must continually try to touch the hearts of those who differ from us, their minds, and their emotions, but never their bodies. Discipline and restraint are the cardinal principles of our conduct and I warn you against any sort of tyrannical social ostracism. I was deeply grieved therefore to hear of the insult offered to a dead body in Delhi and feel that if it was the action of non-co-operators they have disgraced themselves and their creed. I repeat we cannot deliver our land through violence.
U||It was not a joke when I said on the congress platform that Swaraj could be established in one year if there was sufficient response from the nation. Three months of this year are gone. If we are true to our salt, true to our nation, true to the songs we sing, if we are true to the Bhagwad Gita and the Koran, we would finish the programme in the remaining nine months and deliver Islam the Punjab and India.
U||I have proposed a limited programme workable within one year, having a special regard to the educated classes. We seem to be labouring under the illusion that we cannot possibly live without Councils, law courts and schools provided by the Government. The moment we are disillusioned we have Swaraj. It is demoralising both for Government and the governed that a hundred thousand pilgrims should dictate terms to a nation composed of three hundred millions. And how is it they can thus dictate terms. It is because we have been divided and they have ruled. I have never forgotten Humes’ frank confession that the British Government was sustained by the policy of “Divide and Rule.” Therefore it is that I have laid stress upon Hindu Muslim Unity as one of the important essentials for the success of Non-co-operation. But, it should be no lip unity, nor bunia unity it should be a unity broad based on a recognition of the heart. If we want to save Hinduism, I say for Gods sake, do not seek to bargain with the Mussa
U||lmans. I have been going about with Maulana Shaukat Ali all these months, but I have not so much as whispered anything about the protection of the cow. My alliance with the Ali Brothers is one of honour. I feel that I am on my honour, the whole of Hinduism is on its honour, and if it will not be found wanting, it will do its duty towards the Mussalmans of India. Any bargaining would be degrading to us. Light brings light not darkness, and nobility done with a noble purpose will be twice rewarded. It will be God alone who can protect the cow. Ask me not to-day—‘what about the cow,’ ask me after Islam is vindicated through India. Ask the Rajas what they do to entertain their English guests. Do they not provide beef and champagne for their guests. Persuade them first to stop cow killing and then think of bargaining with Mussalmans. And how are we Hindus behaving ourselves towards the cow and her progeny! Do we treat her as our religion requires us? Not till we have set our own house in order and saved the
U|| cow from the Englishmen have we the right to plead on her behalf with the Mussalmans. And the best way of saving the cow from them is to give them unconditional help in their hour of trouble.
U||Similarly what do we owe the Punjab? The whole of India was made to crawl on her belly in as much as a single Punjabi was made to crawl in that dirty lane in Amritsar, the whole womanhood of India was unveiled in as much as the innocent woman of Manianwalla were unveiled by an insolent office; and Indian childhood was dishonoured in that, that school children of tender age were made to walk four times a day to stated places within the martial area in the Punjab and to salute the Union Jack, through the effect of which order two children, seven years old died of sunstroke having been made to wait in the noonday sun. In my opinion it is a sin to attend the schools and colleges conducted under the aegis of this Government so long as it has not purged itself of these crimes by proper repentance. We may not with any sense of self-respect plead before the courts of the Government when we remember that it was through the Punjab Courts that innocent men were sentenced to be imprisoned and hanged. We become participa
U||tors in the crime of the Government by voluntarily helping it or being helped by it.
U||The women of India have intuitively understood the spiritual nature of the struggle. Thousands have attended to listen to the message of non-violent non-co-operation and have given me their precious ornaments for the purpose of advancing the cause of Swaraj. Is it any wonder if I believe the possibility of gaining Swaraj within a year after all these wonderful demonstrations? I would be guilty of want of faith in God if I under-rated the significance of the response from the women of India. I hope that the students will do their duty. The country certainly expects the lawyers who have hitherto led public agitation to recognise the new awakening.
U||I have used strong language but I have done so with the greatest deliberation, I am not actuated by any feeling of revenge. I do not consider Englishmen as my enemy. I recognise the worth of many. I enjoy the privilege of having many English friends, but I am a determined enemy of the English rule as is conducted at present and if the power—tapasya—of one man could destroy it, I would certainly destroy it, if it could not be mended. An Empire that stands for injustice and breach of faith does not deserve to stand if its custodians will not repent and non-co-operation has been devised in order to enable the nation to compel justice.
U||I hope that Bengal will take her proper place in this movement of self-purification. Bengal began Swadeshi and national education when the rest of India was sleeping. I hope that Bengal will come to the front in this movement for gaining Swaraj and gaining justice for the Khilafat and the Punjab through purification and self-sacrifice.
U||ON THE WRONG TRACK
U||Lord Ronaldshay has been doing me the favour of reading my booklet on Indian Home Rule which is a translation of Hind Swaraj. His Lordship told his audience that if Swaraj meant what I had described it to be in the booklet, the Bengalis would have none of it. I am sorry that Swaraj of the Congress resolution does not mean the Swaraj depicted in the booklet; Swaraj according to the Congress means Swaraj that the people of India want, not what the British Government may condescend to give. In so far as I can see, Swaraj will be a Parliament chosen by the people with the fullest power over the finance, the police, the military, the navy, the courts, and the educational institutions.
U||I am free to confess that the Swaraj I expect to gain within one year, if India responds will be such Swaraj as will make practically impossible the repetition of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, and will enable the nation to do good or evil as it chooses, and not he ‘good’ at the dictation of an irresponsible, insolent, and godless bureaucracy. Under that Swaraj the nation will have the power to impose a heavy protective tariff on such foreign goods as are capable of being manufactured in India, as also the power to refuse to send a single soldier outside India for the purpose of enslaving the surrounding or remote nationalities. The Swaraj that I dream of will be a possibility only, when the nation is free to make its choice both of good and evil.
U||I adhere to all I have said in that booklet and I would certainly recommend it to the reader. Government over self is the truest Swaraj, it is synonymous with moksha or salvation, and I have seen nothing to alter the view that doctors, lawyers, and railways are no help, and are often a hindrance, to the one thing worth striving after. But I know that association, a satanic activity, such as the Government is engaged in, makes even an effort for such freedom a practical impossibility. I cannot tender allegiance to God and Satan at the same time.
U||The surest sign of the satanic nature of the present system is that even a nobleman of the type of Lord Ronaldshay is obliged to put us off the track. He will not deal with the one thing needful. Why is he silent about the Punjab? Why does he evade the Khilafat? Can ointments soothe a patient who is suffering from corroding consumption? Does his lordship not see that it is not the inadequacy of the reforms that has set India aflame but that it is the infliction of the two wrongs and the wicked attempt to make us forget them? Does he not see that a complete change of heart is required before reconciliation?
U||But it has become the fashion nowadays to ascribe hatred to non-co-operationism. And I regret to find that even Col. Wedgewood has fallen into the trap. I make bold to say that the only way to remove hatred is to give it disciplined vent. No man can—I cannot—perform the impossible task of removing hatred so long as contempt and despise for the feelings of India are sedulously nursed. It is a mockery to ask India not to hate when in the same breath India’s most sacred feelings are contemptuously brushed aside. India feels weak and helpless and so expresses her helplessness by hating the tyrant who despises her and makes her crawl on the belly, lifts the veils of her innocent women and compels her tender children to acknowledge his power by saluting his flag four times a day. The gospel of Non-co-operation addresses itself to the task of making the people strong and self-reliant. It is an attempt to transform hatred into pity. A strong and self-reliant India will cease to hate Bosworth Smiths and Frank J
U||ohnsons, for she will have the power to punish them and therefore the power also to pity and forgive them. To-day she can neither punish nor forgive, and therefore helplessly nurses hatred. If the Mussalmans were strong, they would not hate the English but would fight and wrest from them the dearest possessions of Islam. I know that the Ali Brothers who live only for the honour and the prestige of Islam, and are prepared any moment to die for it, will to-day make friends with the latter Englishmen, if they were to do justice to the Khilafat which it is in their power to do.
U||I am positively certain that there is no personal element in this fight. Both the Hindus and the Mahomedans would to-day invoke blessings on the English if they would but give proof positive of their goodness, faithfulness, and loyalty to India. Non-co-operation then is a godsend; it will purify and strengthen India; and a strong India will be a strength to the world as an Indian weak and helpless is a curse to mankind. Indian soldiers have involuntarily helped to destroy Turkey and are now destroying the flower of the Arabian nation. I cannot recall a single campaign in which the Indian soldier has been employed by the British Government for the good of mankind. And yet, (Oh! the shame of it!) Indian Maharajas are never tired of priding themselves on the loyal help they have rendered the English! Could degradation sink any lower?
U||THE CONGRESS CONSTITUTION
U||The belated report of the Congress Constitution Committee has now been published for general information and opinion has been invited from all public bodies in order to assist the deliberations of the All India Congress Committee. It is a pity that, small though the Constitution Committee was, all the members never met at any one time in spite of efforts, to have a meeting of them all. It is perhaps no body’s fault that all the members could not meet. At the same time the draft report has passed through the searching examination of all but one member and the report represents the mature deliberations of four out of the five members. It must be stated at the same time that it does not pretend to be the unanimous opinion of the members. Rather than present a dissenting minute, a workable scheme has been brought out leaving each member free to press his own views on the several matters in which they are not quite unanimous. The most important part of the constitution, however, is the alteration of the creed. 
U||So far as I am aware there is no fundamental difference of opinion between the members. In my opinion the altered creed represents the exact feeling of the country at the present moment.
U||I know that the proposed alteration has been subjected to hostile criticism in several newspapers of note. But the extraordinary situation that faces the country is that popular opinion is far in advance of several newspapers which have hitherto commanded influence and have undoubtedly moulded public opinion. The fact is that the formation of opinion to-day is by no means confined to the educated classes, but the masses have taken it upon themselves not only to formulate opinion but to enforce it. It would be a mistake to belittle or ignore this opinion, or to ascribe it to a temporary upheaval. It would be equally a mistake to suppose that this awakening amongst the masses is due either to the activity of the Ali Brothers or myself. For the time being we have the ear of the masses because we voice their sentiments. The masses are by no means so foolish or unintelligent as we sometimes imagine. They often perceive things with their intuition, which we ourselves fail to see with our intellect. But whilst the 
U||masses know what they want, they often do not know how to express their wants and, less often, how to get what they want. Herein comes the use of leadership, and disastrous results can easily follow a bad, hasty, or what is worse, selfish lead.
U||The first part of the proposed creed expresses the present desire of the nation, and the second shows the way that desire can be fulfilled. In my humble opinion the Congress creed with the proposed alteration is but an extension of the original. And so long as no break with the British connection is attempted, it is strictly within even the existing article that defines the Congress creed. The extension lies in the contemplated possibility of a break with the British connection. In my humble opinion, if India is to make unhampered progress, we must make it clear to the British people that whilst we desire to retain the British connection, if we can rise to our full height with it we are determined to dispense with, and even to get rid of that connection, if that is necessary for full national development. I hold that it is not only derogatory to national dignity but it actually impedes national progress superstitiously to believe that our progress towards our goal is impossible without British connection. It
U|| is this superstition which makes some of the best of us tolerate the Punjab wrong and the Khilafat insult. This blind adherence to that connection makes us feel helpless. The proposed alteration in the creed enables us to rid ourselves of our helpless condition. I personally hold that it is perfectly constitutional openly to strive after independence, but lest there may be dispute as to the constitutional character of any movement for complete independence, the doubtful and highly technical adjective “constitutional” has been removed from the altered creed in the draft. Surely it should be enough to ensure that the methods for achieving our end are legitimate, honourable, and peaceful, I believe that this was the reasoning that guided my colleagues in accepting the proposed creed. In any case, such was certainly my view of the whole alteration. There is no desire on my part to adopt any means that are subversive of law and order. I know, however, that I am treading on delicate ground when I write about 
U||law and order for, to some of our distinguished leaders even my present methods appear to be lawless and conducive to disorder. But even they will perhaps grant that the retention of the word ‘constitutional’ cannot protect the country against methods such as I am employing. It gives rise, no doubt, to a luminous legal discussion, but any such discussion is fruitless when the nation means business. The other important alteration refers to the limitation of the number of delegates. I believe that the advantages of such a limitation are obvious. We are fast reaching a time when without any such limitation the Congress will become an unwieldy body. It is difficult even to have an unlimited number of visitors; it is impossible to transact national business if we have an unlimited number of delegates.
U||The next important alteration is about the election of the members of the All-India Congress Committee, making that committee practically the Subjects Committee, and the redistribution of India for the purposes of the Congress on a linguistic basis. It is not necessary to comment on these alterations, but I wish to add that if the Congress accepts the principle of limiting the number of delegates it would be advisable to introduce the principle of proportional representation. That would enable all parties who wish to be represented at the Congress.
U||I observe that the Servant of India sees an inconsistency between my implied acceptance of the British Committee, so far as the published draft constitution is concerned, and my recent article in Young India on that Committee and the newspaper India. But it is well known that for several years I have held my present views about the existence of that body. It would have been irrelevant for me, perhaps, to suggest to my colleagues the extinction of that committee. It was not our function to report on the usefulness or otherwise of the Committee. We were commissioned only for preparing a new constitution. Moreover I knew that my colleagues were not averse to the existence of the British Committee. And the drawing up of a new constitution enabled me to show that where there was no question of principle I was desirous of agreeing quickly with my opponents in opinions. But I propose certainly to press for abolition of the committee as it is at present continued, and the stopping of its organ India.
U||SWARAJ IN NINE MONTHS
U||Asked by the Times representative as to his impressions formed as a result of his activities during the last three months, Mr. Gandhi said:—“My own impression of these three months’ extensive experience is that this movement of non-co-operation has come to stay, and it is most decidedly a purifying movement, in spite of isolated instances of rowdyism, as for instance at Mrs. Besant’s meeting in Bombay, at some places in Delhi, Bengal, and even in Gujarat. The people are assimilating day after day the spirit of non-violence, not necessarily as a creed, but as an inevitable policy. I expect most startling results, more startling than, say, the discoveries of Sir J.C. Bose, or the acceptance by the people of non-violence. If the Government could be assured beyond any possibility of doubt that no violence would ever be offered by us the Government would from that moment alter its character, unconsciously and involuntarily, but nonetheless surely on that account.”
U||“Alter its character,—in what, direction?” asked the Times representative.
U||“Certainly in the direction which we ask it should move—that being in the direction of Government becoming responsive to every call of the nation.”
U||“Will you kindly explain further?” asked the representative.
U||“By that I mean,” said Mr. Gandhi, “people will be able by asserting themselves through fixed determination and self-sacrifice to gain the redress of the Khilafat wrong, the Punjab wrong, and attain the Swaraj of their choice.”
U||“But what is your Swaraj, and where does the Government come in there—the Government which, you say will alter its character unconsciously?”
U||“My Swaraj,” said Mr. Gandhi, “is the Parliamentary Government of India in the modern sense of the term for the time being, and that Government would be secured to us either through the friendly offices of the British people or without them.”
U||“What do you mean by the phrase, ‘without them!’” questioned the interviewer.
U||“This movement,” continued Mr. Gandhi, “is an endeavour to purge the present Government of selfishness and greed which determine almost every one of their activities. Suppose that we have made it impossible by disassociation from them to feed their greed. They might not wish to remain in India, as happened in the case of Somaliland, where the moment its administration ceased to be a paying proposition they evacuated it.”
U||“How do you think,” queried the representative, “in practice this will work out?”
U||“What I have sketched before you,” said Mr. Gandhi, “is the final possibility. What I expect is that nothing of that kind will happen. In so far as I understand the British people I will recognise the force of public opinion when it has become real and patent. Then, and only then, will they realise the hideous injustice which in their name the Imperial ministers and their representatives in India have perpetrated. They will therefore remedy the two wrongs in accordance with the wishes of the people, and they will also offer a constitution exactly in accordance with the wishes of the people of India, as represented by their chosen leaders.
U||“Supposing that the British Government wish to retire because India is not a paying concern, what do you think will then be the position of India?”
U||Mr. Gandhi answered: “At that stage surely it is easy to understand that India will then have evolved either outstanding spiritual height or the ability to offer violence, against violence. She will have evolved an organising ability of a high order, and will therefore be in every way able to cope with any emergency that might arise.” “In other words,” observed the Times representative, “you expect the moment of the British evacuation, if such a contingency arises, will coincide with the moment of India’s preparedness and ability and conditions favourable for India to take over the Indian administration as a going concern and work it for the benefit and advancement of the Nation?”
U||Mr. Gandhi answered the question with an emphatic affirmative. “My experience during the last months fills me with the hope,” continued Mr. Gandhi, “that within the nine months that remain of the year in which I have expected Swaraj for India we shall redress the two wrongs and we shall see Swaraj established in accordance with the wishes of the people of India.”
U||“Where will the present Government be at the end of the nine months?” Asked the Times representative.
U||Mr. Gandhi, with a significant smile, said: “The lion will then lie with the lamb.”
U||Young India, December, 1920.
U||THE ATTAINMENT OF SWARAJ
U||Mr. Gandhi in moving his resolution on the creed before the Congress, said, “The resolution which I have the honour to move is as follows: The object of the Indian National Congress is the attainment of Swarajya by the people of India by all legitimate and peaceful means.”
U||There are only two kinds of objections, so far as I understand, that will be advanced from this platform. One is that we may not to-day think of dissolving the British connection. What I say is that it is derogatory to national dignity to think of permanence of British connection at any cost. We are labouring under a grievous wrong, which it is the personal duty of every Indian to get redressed. This British Government not only refused to redress the wrong, but it refuses to acknowledge its mistake and so long as it retains its attitude, it is not possible for us to say all that we want to be or all that we want to get, retaining British connection. No matter what difficulties be in our path, we must make the clearest possible declaration to the world and to the whole of India, that we may not possibly have British connection, if the British people will not do this elementary justice. I do not, for one moment, suggest that we want to end at the British connection at all costs, unconditionally. If the British
U|| connection is for the advancement of India, we do not want to destroy it. But if it is inconsistent with our national self respect, then it is our bounden duty to destroy it. There is room in this resolution for both—those who believe that, by retaining British connection, we can purify ourselves and purify British people, and those who have no belief. As for instance, take the extreme case of Mr. Andrews. He says all hope for India is gone for keeping the British connection. He says there must be complete severance—complete independence. There is room enough in this creed for a man like Mr. Andrews also. Take another illustration, a man like myself or my brother Shaukat Ali. There is certainly no room for us, if we have eternally to subscribe to the doctrine, whether these wrongs are redressed or not, we shall have to evolve ourselves within the British Empire; there is no room for me in that creed. Therefore this creed is elastic enough to take in both shades of opinions and the British people will ha
U||ve to beware that, if they do not want to do justice, it will be the bounden duty of every Indian to destroy the Empire.
U||I want just now to wind up my remarks with a personal appeal, drawing your attention to an object lesson that was presented in the Bengal camp yesterday. If you want Swaraj, you have got a demonstration of how to get Swaraj. There was a little bit of skirmish, a little bit of squabble, and a little bit of difference in the Bengal camp, as there will always be differences so long as the world lasts. I have known differences between husband and wife, because I am still a husband; I have noticed differences between parents and children, because I am still a father of four boys, and they are all strong enough to destroy their father so far as bodily struggle is concerned; I possess that varied experience of husband and parent; I know that we shall always have squabbles, we shall always have differences but the lesson that I want to draw your attention to is that I had the honour and privilege of addressing both the parties. They gave me their undivided attention and what is more they showed their attachment, the
U||ir affection and their fellowship for me by accepting the humble advice that I had the honour of tendering to them, and I told them I am not here to distribute justice that can be awarded only through our worthy president. But I ask you not to go to the president, you need not worry him. If you are strong, if you are brave, if you are intent upon getting Swaraj, and if you really want to revise the creed, then you will bottle up your rage, you will bottle up all the feelings of injustice that may rankle in your hearts and forget these things here under this very roof and I told them to forget their differences, to forgot the wrongs. I don’t want to tell you or go into the history of that incident. Probably most of you know. I simply want to invite your attention to the fact. I don’t say they have settled up their differences. I hope they have but I do know that they undertook to forget the differences. They undertook not to worry the President, they undertook not to make any demonstration here or in the 
U||Subjects Committee. All honour to those who listened to that advice.
U||I only wanted my Bengali friends and all the other friends who have come to this great assembly with a fixed determination to seek nothing but the settlement of their country, to seek nothing but the advancement of their respective rights, to seek nothing but the conservation of the national honour. I appeal to every one of you to copy the example set by those who felt aggrieved and who felt that their heads were broken. I know, before we have done with this great battle on which we have embarked at the special sessions of the Congress, we have to go probably, possibly through a sea of blood, but let it not be said of us or any one of us that we are guilty of shedding blood, but let it be said by generations yet to be born that we suffered, that we shed not somebody’s blood but our own, and so I have no hesitation in saying that I do not want to show much sympathy for those who had their heads broken or who were said to be even in danger of losing their lives. What does it matter? It is much better to die 
U||at the hands, at least, of our own countrymen. What is there to revenge ourselves about or upon. So I ask everyone of you that if at any time there is blood-boiling within you against some fellow countrymen of yours, even though he may be in the employ of Government, though he may be in the Secret Service, you will take care not to be offended and not to return blow for blow. Understand that the very moment you return the blow from the detective, your cause is lost. This is your non-violent campaign. And so I ask everyone of you not to retaliate but to bottle up all your rage, to dismiss your rage from you and you will rise graver men. I am here to congratulate those who have restrained themselves from going to the President and bringing the dispute before him.
U||Therefore I appeal to those who feel aggrieved to feel that they have done the right thing in forgetting it and if they have not forgotten I ask them to try to forget the thing; and that is the object lesson to which I wanted to draw your attention if you want to carry this resolution. Do not carry this resolution only by an acclamation for this resolution, but I want you to accompany the carrying out of this resolution with a faith and resolve which nothing on earth can move. That you are intent upon getting Swaraj at the earliest possible moment and that you are intent upon getting Swaraj by means that are legitimate, that are honourable and by means that are non-violent, that are peaceful, you have resolved upon, so far you can say to-day. We cannot give battle to this Government by means of steel, but we can give battle by exercising, what I have so often called, “soul force” and soul force is not the prerogative of one man of a Sanyasi or even a so-called saint. Soul force is the prerogative of ever
U||y human being, female or male and therefore I ask my countrymen, if they want to accept this resolution, to accept it with that firm determination and to understand that it is inaugurated under such good and favourable auspices as I have described to you.
U||In my humble opinion, the Congress will have done the rightest thing, if it unanimously adopts this resolution. May God grant that you will pass this resolution unanimously, may God grant that you will also have the courage and the ability to carry out the resolution and that within one year.
U||V. HINDU MOSLEM UNITY
U||[A dialogue between Editor and reader on the Hindu-Moslem Unity—Indian Home Rule.]
U||THE HINDUS AND THE MAHOMEDANS.
U||EDITOR: Your last question is a serious one, and yet, on careful consideration, it will be found to be easy of solution. The question arises because of the presence of the railways of the lawyers, and of the doctors. We shall presently examine the last two. We have already considered the railways. I should, however, like to add that man is so made by nature as to require him to restrict his movements as far as his hands and feet will take him. If we did not rush about from place to place by means of railways such other maddening conveniences, much of the confusion that arises would be obviated. Our difficulties are of our own creation. God set a limit to a man’s locomotive ambition in the construction of his body. Man immediately proceeded to discover means of overriding the limit. God gifted man with intellect that he might know his Maker. Man abused it, so that he might forget his Maker. I am so constructed that I can only serve my immediate neighbours, but, in my conceit, I pretend to have discovered th
U||at I must with my body serve every individual in the Universe. In thus attempting the impossible, man comes in contact with different natures, different religions, and is utterly confounded. According to this reasoning, it must be apparent to you that railways are a most dangerous institution. Man has therefore gone further away from his Maker.
U||READER: But I am impatient to hear your answer to my question. Has the introduction of Mahomedanism not unmade the nation?
U||EDITOR: India cannot cease to be one nation because people belonging to different religions live in it. The introduction of foreigners does not necessarily destroy the nation, they merge in it. A country is one nation only when such a condition obtains in it. That country must have a faculty for assimilation. India has ever been such a country. In reality, there are as many religions as there are individuals, but those who are conscious of the spirit of nationality do not interfere with one another’s religion. If they do, they are not fit to be considered a nation. If the Hindus believe that India should be peopled only by Hindus, they are living in dreamland. The Hindus, the Mahomedans, the Parsees and the Christians who have made India their country are fellow countrymen, and they will have to live in unity if only for their own interest. In no part of the world are one nationality and one religion synonymous terms: nor has it ever been so in India.
U||READER: But what about the inborn enmity between Hindus and Mahomedans?
U||EDITOR: That phrase has been invented by our mutual enemy. When the Hindus and Mahomedans fought against one another, they certainly spoke in that strain. They have long since ceased to fight. How, then, can there be any inborn enmity? Pray remember this, too, that we did not cease to fight only after British occupation. The Hindus flourished under Moslem sovereigns, and Moslems under the Hindu. Each party recognised that mutual fighting was suicidal, and that neither party would abandon its religion by force of arms. Both parties, therefore, decided to live in peace. With the English advent the quarrels recommenced.
U||The proverbs you have quoted were coined when both were fighting; to quote them now is obviously harmful. Should we not remember that many Hindus and Mahomedans own the same ancestors, and the same blood runs through their veins? Do people become enemies because they change their religion? Is the God of the Mahomedan different from the God of the Hindu? Religions are different roads converging to the same point. What does it matter that we take different roads, so long as we reach the same goal? Wherein is the cause for quarrelling?
U||Moreover, there are deadly proverbs as between the followers of Shiva and those of Vishnu, yet nobody suggests that these two do not belong to the same nation. It is said that the Vedic religion is different from Jainism, but the followers of the respective faiths are not different nations. The fact is that we have become enslaved, and, therefore, quarrel and like to have our quarrels decided by a third party. There are Hindu iconoclasts as there are Mahomedan. The more we advance in true knowledge, the better we shall understand that we need not be at war with those whose religion we may not follow.
U||READER: Now I would like to know your views about cow protection.
U||EDITOR: I myself respect the cow, that is, I look upon her with affectionate reverence. The cow is the protector of India, because, it being an agricultural country, is dependent on the cow’s progeny. She is a most useful animal in hundreds of ways. Our Mahomedan brethren will admit this.
U||But, just as I respect the cow so do I respect my fellow-men. A man is just as useful as a cow, no matter whether he be a Mahomedan or a Hindu. Am I, then to fight with or kill a Mahomedan in order to save a cow? In doing so, I would become an enemy as well of the cow as of the Mahomedan. Therefore, the only method I know of protecting the cow is that I should approach my Mahomedan brother and urge him for the sake of the country to join me in protecting her. If he would not listen to me, I should let the cow go for the simple reason that the matter is beyond my ability. If I were over full of pity for the cow, I should sacrifice my life to save her, but not take my brother’s. This, I hold, is the law of our religion.
U||When men become obstinate, it is a difficult thing. If I pull one way, my Moslem brother will pull another. If I put on a superior air, he will return the compliment. If I bow to him gently, he will do it much, more so, and if he does not, I shall not be considered to have done wrong in having bowed. When the Hindus became insistent, the killing of cows increased. In my opinion, cow protection societies may be considered cow killing societies. It is a disgrace to us that we should need such societies. When we forgot how to protect cows, I suppose we needed such societies.
U||What am I to do when a blood-brother is on the point of killing a cow? Am I to kill him, or to fall down at his feet and implore him? If you admit that I should adopt the latter course I must do the same to my Moslem brother. Who protects the cow from destruction by Hindus when they cruelly ill-treat her? Whoever reasons with the Hindus when they mercilessly belabour the progeny of the cow with their sticks? But this has not prevented us from remaining one nation.
U||Lastly, if it be true that the Hindus believe in the doctrine of non-killing, and the Mahomedans do not, what, I pray, is the duty of the former? It is not written that a follower of the religion of Ahimsa (non-killing) may kill a fellow-man. For him the way is straight. In order to save one being, he may not kill another. He can only plead—therein lies his sole duty.
U||But does every Hindu believe in Ahimsa? Going to the root of the matter, not one man really practises such a religion, because we do destroy life. We are said to follow that religion because we want to obtain freedom from liability to kill any kind of life. Generally speaking, we may observe that many Hindus partake of meat and are not, therefore, followers of Ahimsa. It is, therefore, preposterous to suggest that the two cannot live together amicably because the Hindus believe in Ahimsa and the Mahomedans do not.
U||These thoughts are put into our minds by selfish and false religious teachers. The English put the finishing touch. They have a habit of writing history; they pretend to study the manners and customs of all peoples, God has given us a limited mental capacity, but they usurp the function of the Godhead and indulge in novel experiments. They write about their own researches in most laudatory terms and hypnotise us into believing them. We in our ignorance, then fall at their feet.
U||Those who do not wish to misunderstand things may read up the Koran, and will find therein hundreds of passages acceptable to the Hindus; and the Bhagavad Gita contains passages to which not a Mahomedan can take exception. Am I to dislike a Mahomedan because there are passages in the Koran I do not understand or like? It takes two to make a quarrel. If I do not want to quarrel with a Mahomedan, the latter will be powerless to foist a quarrel on me, and, similarly, I should be powerless if a Mahomedan refuses his assistance to quarrel with me. An arm striking the air will become disjointed. If everyone will try to understand the core of his own religion and adhere to it, and will not allow false teachers to dictate to him, there will be no room left for quarrelling.
U||READER: But, will the English ever allow the two bodies to join hands?
U||EDITOR: This question arises out of your timidity. It betrays our shallowness. If two brothers want to live in peace, is it possible for a third party to separate them? If they were to listen to evil counsels, we would consider them to be foolish. Similarly, we Hindus and Mahomedans would have to blame our folly rather than the English, if we allowed them to put asunder. A clay pot would break through impact; if not with one stone, thou with another. The way to save the pot is not to keep it away from the danger point, but to bake it so that no stone would break it. We have then to make our hearts of perfectly baked clay. Then we shall be steeled against all danger. This can be easily done by the Hindus. They are superior in numbers, they pretend that they are more educated, they are, therefore, better able to shield themselves from attack on their amicable relations with the Mahomedans.
U||There is a mutual distrust between the two communities. The Mahomedans, therefore, ask for certain concessions from Lord Morley. Why should the Hindus oppose this? If the Hindus desisted, the English would notice it, the Mahomedans would gradually begin to trust the Hindus, and brotherliness would be the outcome. We should be ashamed to take our quarrels to the English. Everyone can find out for himself that the Hindus can lose nothing be desisting. The man who has inspired confidence in another has never lost anything in this world.
U||I do not suggest that the Hindus and the Mahomedans will never fight. Two brothers living together often do so. We shall sometimes have our heads broken. Such a thing ought not to be necessary, but all men are not equi-minded. When people are in a rage, they do many foolish things. These we have to put up with. But, when we do quarrel, we certainly do not want to engage counsel and to resort to English or any law-courts. Two men fight; both have their heads broken, or one only. How shall a third party distribute justice amongst them? Those who fight may expect to be injured.
U||HINDU-MAHOMEDAN UNITY
U||Mr. Candler some time ago asked me in an imaginary interview whether if I was sincere in my professions of Hindu-Mahomedan Unity. I would eat and drink with a Mahomedean and give my daughter in marriage to a Mahomedan. This question has been asked again by some friends in another form. Is it necessary for Hindu Mahomedan Unity that there should he interdining and intermarrying? The questioners say that if the two are necessary, real unity can never take place because crores of Sanatanis would never reconcile themselves to interdining, much less to intermarriage.
U||I am one of those who do not consider caste to be a harmful institution. In its origin caste was a wholesome custom and promoted national well-being. In my opinion the idea that interdining or intermarrying is necessary for national growth, is a superstition borrowed from the West. Eating is a process just as vital as the other sanitary necessities of life. And if mankind had not, much to its harm, made of eating a fetish and indulgence we would have performed the operation of eating in private even as one performs the other necessary functions of life in private. Indeed the highest culture in Hinduism regards eating in that light and there are thousands of Hindus still living who will not eat their food in the presence of anybody. I can recall the names of several cultured men and women who ate their food in entire privacy but who never had any illwill against anybody and who lived on the friendliest terms with all.
U||Intermarriage is a still more difficult question. If brothers and sisters can live on the friendliest footing without ever thinking of marrying each other, I can see no difficulty in my daughter regarding every Mahomedan brother and vice versa. I hold strong views on religion and on marriage. The greater the restraint we exercise with regard to our appetites whether about eating or marrying, the better we become from a religious standpoint. I should despair of ever cultivating amicable relations with the world, if I had to recognise the right or the propriety of any young man offering his hand in marriage to my daughter or to regard it as necessary for me to dine with anybody and everybody. I claim that I am living on terms of friendliness with the whole world. I have never quarrelled with a single Mahomedan or Christian but for years I have taken nothing but fruit in Mahomedan or Christian households. I would most certainly decline to eat food cooked from the same plate with my son or to drink water out of 
U||a cup which his lips have touched and which has not been washed. But the restraint or the exclusiveness exercised in these matters by me has never affected the closest companionship with the Mahomedan or the Christian friends or my sons.
U||But interdining and intermarriage have never been a bar to disunion, quarrels and worse. The Pandavas and the Kauravas flew at one another’s throats without compunction although they interdined and intermarried. The bitterness between the English and the Germans has not yet died out.
U||The fact is that intermarriage and interdining are not necessary factors in friendship and unity though they are often emblems thereof. But insistence on either the one or the other can easily become and is to-day a bar to Hindu-Mahomedan Unity. If we make ourselves believe that Hindus and Mahomedans cannot be one unless they interdine or intermarry, we would be creating an artificial barrier between us which it might be almost impossible to remove. And it would seriously interfere with the flowing unity between Hindus and Mahomedans if, for example, Mahomedan youths consider it lawful to court Hindu girls. The Hindu parents will not, even if they suspected any such thing, freely admit Mahomedans to their homes as they have begun to do now. In my opinion it is necessary for Hindu and Mahomedan young men to recognise this limitation.
U||I hold it to be utterly impossible for Hindus and Mahomedans to intermarry and yet retain intact each other’s religion. And the true beauty of Hindu-Mahomedan Unity lies in each remaining true to his own religion and yet being true to each other. For, we are thinking of Hindus and Mahomedans even of the most orthodox type being able to regard one another as natural friends instead of regarding one another as natural enemies as they have done hitherto.
U||What then does the Hindu-Mahomedan Unity consist in and how can it be best promoted? The answer is simple. It consists in our having a common purpose, a common goal and common sorrows. It is best promoted by co-operating to reach the common goal, by sharing one another’s sorrow and by mutual toleration. A common goal we have. We wish this great country of ours to be greater and self-governing.[4] We have enough sorrows to share and to-day seeing that the Mahomedans are deeply touched on the question of Khilafat and their case is just, nothing can be so powerful for winning Mahomedans friendship for the Hindu as to give his whole-hearted support to the Mahomedan claim. No amount of drinking out of the same cup or dining out of the same bowl can bind the two as this help in the Khilafat question.
U||And mutual toleration is a necessity for all time and for all races. We cannot live in peace if the Hindu will not tolerate the Mahomedan form of worship of God and his manners and customs or if the mahomedans will be impatient of Hindu idolatory, cow-worship. It is not necessary for toleration that I must approve of what I tolerate. I heartily dislike drinking, meat eating and smoking, but I tolerate all these in Hindus, Mahomedans and Christians even as I expect them to tolerate my abstinence from all these, although they may dislike it. All the quarrels between the Hindus and the Mahomedans have arisen from each wanting to force the other his view.
U||HINDU-MUSLIM UNITY
U||There can be no doubt that successful non-co-operation depends as much on Hindu-Muslim Unity as on non-violence. Greatest strain will be put upon both in the course of the struggle and if it survives that strain, victory is a certainty.
U||A severe strain was put upon it in Agra and it has been stated that when either party went to the authorities they were referred to Maulana Shaukat Ali and me. Fortunately there was a far better man at hand. Hakimji Ajmal khan is a devout Muslim who commands the confidence and the respect of both the parties. He with his band of workers hastened to Agra, settled the dispute and the parties became friends as they were never before. An incident occurred nearer Delhi and the same influence worked successfully to avoid what might have become an explosion.
U||But Hakimji Ajmal khan cannot be everywhere appearing at the exact hour as an angel of peace. Nor can Maulana Shankat Ali or I go everywhere. And yet perfect peace must be observed between the two communities in spite of attempts to divide them.
U||Why was there any appeal made to the authorities at all at Agra? If we are to work out non-co-operation with any degree of success we must be able to dispense with the protection of the Government when we quarrel among ourselves. The whole scheme of non-co-operation must break to pieces, if our final reliance is to be upon British intervention for the adjustment of our quarrels or the punishment of the guilty ones. In every village and hamlet there must be at least one Hindu and one Muslim, whose primary business must be to prevent quarrels between the two. Some times however, even blood-brothers come to blows. In the initial stages we are bound to do so here and there. Unfortunately we who are public workers have made little attempt to understand and influence the masses and least of all the most turbulent among them. During the process of insinuating ourselves in the estimation of the masses and until we have gained control over the unruly, there are bound to be exhibitions of hasty temper now and then. We
U|| must learn at such times to do without an appeal to the Government. Hakimji Ajmal Khan has shown us how to do it.
U||The union that we want is not a patched up thing but a union of hearts based upon a definite recognition of the indubitable proposition that Swaraj for India must be an impossible dream without an indissoluble union between the Hindus and the Muslims of India. It must not be a mere truce. It cannot be based upon mutual fear. It must be a partnership between equals each respecting the religion of the other.
U||I would frankly despair of reaching such union if there was anything in the holy Quran enjoining upon the followers of Islam to treat Hindus as their natural enemies or if there was anything in Hinduism to warrant a belief in the eternal enmity between the two.
U||We would ill learn our history if we conclude that because we have quarrelled in the past, we are destined so to continue unless some such strong power like the British keep us by force of arms from flying at each other’s throats. But I am convinced that there is no warrant in Islam or Hinduism for any such belief. True it is that interested fanatical priests in both religions have set the one against the other. It is equally true that Muslim rulers like Christian rulers have used the sword for the propagation of their respective faiths. But in spite of many dark things of the modern times, the world’s opinion to-day will as little tolerate forcible conversions as it will tolerate forcible slavery. That probably is the most effective contribution of the scientific spirit of the age. That spirit has revolutionised many a false notion about Christianity as it has about Islam. I do not know a single writer on Islam who defends the use of force in the proselytising process. The influences exerted in our time
U||s are far more subtle than that of the sword.
U||I believe that in the midst of all the bloodshed, chicane and fraud being resorted to on a colossal scale in the west, the whole humanity is silently but surely making progress towards a better age. And India by finding true independence and self-expression through an imperishable Hindu-Muslim unity and through non-violent means, i.e., unadulterated self sacrifice can point a way out of the prevailing darkness.
U||VI. TREATMENT OF THE DEPRESSED CLASSES
U||DEPRESSED CLASSES
U||Vivekanand used to call the Panchamas ‘suppressed classes.’ There is no doubt that Vivekanand’s is a more accurate adjective. We have suppressed them and have consequently become ourselves depressed. That we have become the ‘Pariahs of the Empire’ is, in Gokhale’s language, the retributive justice meted out to us by a just God. A correspondent indignantly asks me in a pathetic letter reproduced elsewhere, what I am doing for them. I have given the letter with the correspondent’s own heading. Should not we the Hindus wash our bloodstained hands before we ask the English to wash theirs? This is a proper question reasonably put. And if a member of a slave nation could deliver the suppressed classes from their slavery without freeing myself from my own, I would do so to day. But it is an impossible task. A slave has not the freedom even to do the right thing. It is a right for me to prohibit the importation of foreign goods, but I have no power to bring it about. It was right for Maulana Mahomed Al
U||i to go to Turkey and to tell the Turks personally that India was with them in their righteous struggle. He was not free to do so. If I had a truly national legislative I would answer Hindu insolence by creating special and better wells for the exclusive use of suppressed classes and by erecting better and more numerous schools for them, so that there would be not a single member of the suppressed classes left without a school to teach their children. But I must wait for that better day.
U||Meanwhile are the depressed classes to be loft to their own resources? Nothing of the sort. In my own humble manner I have done and am doing all I can for my Panchama brother.
U||There are three courses open to those downtrodden members of the nation. For their impatience they may call in the assistance of the slave owning Government. They will get it but they will fall from the frying pan into the fire. To-day they are slaves of slaves. By seeking Government aid, they will be used for suppressing their kith and kin. Instead of being sinned against, they will themselves be the sinners. The Mussalmans tried it and failed. They found that they were worse off than before. The Sikhs did it unwittingly and failed. To-day there is no more discontented community in India than the Sikhs. Government aid is therefore no solution.
U||The second is rejection of Hinduism and wholesale conversion to Islam or Christianity. And if a change of religion could be justified for worldly betterment, I would advise it without hesitation. But religion is a matter of the heart. No physical inconvenience can warrant abandonment of one’s own religion. If the inhuman treatment of the Panchamas were a part of Hinduism, its rejection would be a paramount duty both for them and for those like me who would not make a fetish even of religion and condone every evil in its sacred name. But, I believe that untouchability is no part of Hinduism. It is rather its excrescence to be removed by every effort. And there is quite an army of Hindu reformers who have set their heart upon ridding Hinduism of this blot. Conversion, therefore, I hold, is no remedy whatsoever.
U||Then there remains, finally, self-help and self-dependence, with such aid as the non-Panchama Hindus will render of their own motion, not as a matter of patronage but as a matter of duty. And herein comes the use of non-co-operation. My correspondent was correctly informed by Mr. Rajagopaluchari and Mr. Hanumantarao that I would favour well-regulated non-co-operation for this acknowledged evil. But non-co-operation means independence of outside help, it means effort from within. It would not be non-co-operation to insist on visiting prohibited areas. That may be civil disobedience if it is peacefully carried out. But I have found to my cost that civil disobedience requires far greater preliminary training and self-control. All can non-co-operate, but few only can offer civil disobedience. Therefore, by way of protest against Hinduism, the Panchamas can certainly stop all contact and connection with the other Hindus so long as special grievances are maintained. But this means organised intelligent effort. And
U|| so far as I can see, there is no leader among the Panchamas who can lead them to victory through non-co-operation.
U||The better way, therefore, perhaps, is for the Panchamas heartily to join the great national movement that is now going on for throwing off the slavery of the present Government. It is easy enough for the Panchama friends to see that non-co-operation against this evil government presupposes co-operation between the different sections forming the Indian nation. The Hindus must realise that if they wish to offer successful non-co-operation against the Government, they must make common cause with the Panchamas, even as they have made common cause with the Mussalmans. Non-co-operation with it is free from violence, is essentially a movement of intensive self-purification. That process has commenced and whether the Panchamas deliberately take part in it or not, the rest of the Hindus dare not neglect them without hampering their own progress. Hence though the Panchama problem is as dear to me as life itself, I rest satisfied with the exclusive attention to national non-co-operation. I feel sure that the greater i
U||ncludes the less.
U||Closely allied to this question is the non-Brahmin question. I wish I had studied it more closely than I have been able to. A quotation from my speech delivered at a private meeting in Madras has been torn from its context and misused to further the antagonism between the so-called Brahmins and the so-called non-Brahmins. I do not wish to retract a word of what I said at that meeting, I was appealing to those who are accepted as Brahmins. I told them that in my opinion the treatment of non-Brahmins by the Brahmins was as satanic as the treatment of us by the British. I added that the non-Brahmins should be placated without any ado or bargaining. But my remarks were never intended to encourage the powerful non-Brahmins of Maharashira or Madras, or the mischievous element among them, to overawe the so-called Brahmins. I use the word ‘so-called’ advisedly. For the Brahmins who have freed themselves from the thraldom of superstitious orthodoxy have not only no quarrel with non-Brahmins as such, but are in ev
U||ery way eager to advance non-Brahmins wherever they are weak. No lover of his country can possibly achieve its general advance if he dared to neglect the least of his countrymen. Those non-Brahmins therefore who are coqueting with the Government are selling themselves and the nation to which they belong. By all means let those who have faith in the Government help to sustain it, but let no Indian worthy of his birth cut off his nose to spite the face.
U||AMELIORATION OF THE DEPRESSED CLASSES
U||The resolution of the Senate of the Gujarat National University in regard to Mr. Andrews’ question about the admission of children of the ‘depressed’ classes to the schools affiliated to that University is reported to have raised a flutter in Ahmedabad. Not only has the flutter given satisfaction to a ‘Times of India’ correspondent, but the occasion has led to the discovery by him of another defect in the constitution of the Senate in that it does not contain a single Muslim member. The discovery, however, I may inform the reader, is no proof of the want of national character of the University. The Hindu-Muslim unity is no mere lip expression. It requires no artificial proofs. The simple reason why there is no Mussalman representative on the Senate is that no higher educated Mussalman, able to give his time, has been found to take sufficient interest in the national education movement. I merely refer to this matter to show that we must reckon with attempts to discredit the movement even misinterpre
U||tation of motives. That is a difficulty from without and easier to deal with.
U||The ‘depressed’ classes difficulty is internal and therefore far more serious because it may give rise to a split and weaken the cause—no cause can survive internal difficulties if they are indefinitely multiplied. Yet there can be no surrender in the matter of principles for the avoidance of splits. You cannot promote a cause when you are undermining it by surrendering its vital parts. The depressed classes problem is a vital part of the cause. Swaraj is as inconceivable without full reparation to the ‘depressed’ classes as it is impossible without real Hindu-Muslim unity. In my opinion we have become ‘pariahs of the Empire’ because we have created ‘pariahs’ in our midst. The slave owner is always more hurt than the slave. We shall be unfit to gain Swaraj so long as we would keep in bondage a fifth of the population of Hindustan. Have we not made the ‘pariah’ crawl on his belly? Have we not segregated him? And if it is religion so to treat the ‘pariah.’ It is the religion of the wh
U||ite race to segregate us. And if it is no argument for the white races to say that we are satisfied with the badge of our inferiority, it is less for us to say that the ‘pariah’ is satisfied with his. Our slavery is complete when we begin to hug it.
U||The Gujarat Senate therefore counted the cost when it refused to bend before the storm. This non-co-operation is a process of self-purification. We may not cling to putrid customs and claim the pure boon of Swaraj. Untouchability I hold is a custom, not an integral part of Hinduism. The world advanced in thought, though it is still barbarous in action. And no religion can stand that which is not based on fundamental truths. Any glorification of error will destroy a religion as surely as disregard of a disease is bound to destroy a body.
U||This government of ours is an unscrupulous corporation. It has ruled by dividing Mussalmans from Hindus. It is quite capable of taking advantage of the internal weaknesses of Hinduism. It will set the ‘depressed’ classes against the rest of the Hindus, non-Brahmins against Brahmins. The Gujarat Senate resolution does not end the trouble. It merely points out the difficulty. The trouble will end only when the masses and classes of Hindus have rid themselves of the sin of untouchability. A Hindu lover of Swaraj will as assiduously work for the amelioration of the lot of the ‘depressed’ classes as he works for Hindu-Muslim unity. We must treat them as our brothers and give them the same rights that we claim for ourselves.
U||THE SIN OF UNTOUCHABILITY
U||It is worthy of note that the subjects Committee accepted without any opposition the clause regarding the sin of untouchability. It is well that the National assembly passed the resolution stating that the removal of this blot on Hinduism was necessary for the attainment of Swaraj. The Devil succeeds only by receiving help from his fellows. He always takes advantage of the weakest spots in our natures in order to gain mastery over us. Even so does the Government retain its control over us through our weaknesses or vices. And if we would render ourselves proof against its machination, we must remove our weaknesses. It is for that reason that I have called non-co-operation a process of purification. As soon as that process is completed, this government must fall to pieces for want of the necessary environment, just as mosquitos cease to haunt a place whose cess-pools are filled up and dried.
U||Has not a just Nemesis overtaken us for the crime of untouchability? Have we not reaped as we have sown? Have we not practised Dwyerism and O’Dwyerism on our own kith and kin? We have segregated the ‘pariah’ and we are in turn segregated in the British Colonies. We deny him the use of public wells; we throw the leavings of our plates at him. His very shadow pollutes us. Indeed there is no charge that the ‘pariah’ cannot fling in our faces and which we do not fling in the faces of Englishmen.
U||How is this blot on Hinduism to be removed? ‘Do unto others as you would that others should do unto you.’ I have often told English officials that, if they are friends and servants of India, they should come down from their pedestal, cease to be patrons, demonstrate by their loving deeds that they are in every respect our friends, and believe us to be equals in the same sense they believe fellow Englishmen to be their equals. After the experiences of the Punjab and the Khilafat, I have gone a step further and asked them to repent and to change their hearts. Even so is it necessary for us Hindus to repent of the wrong we have done, to alter our behaviour towards those whom we have ‘suppressed’ by a system as devilish as we believe the English system of the Government of India to be. We must not throw a few miserable schools at them; we must not adopt the air of superiority towards them. We must treat them as our blood brothers as they are in fact. We must return to them the inheritance of which we hav
U||e robbed them. And this must not be the act of a few English-knowing reformers merely, but it must be a conscious voluntary effort on the part of the masses. We may not wait till eternity for this much belated reformation. We must aim at bringing it about within this year of grace, probation, preparation and tapasya. It is a reform not to follow Swaraj but to precede it.
U||Untouchability is not a sanction of religion, it is a devise of Satan. The devil has always quoted scriptures. But scriptures cannot transcend reason and truth. They are intended to purify reason and illuminate truth. I am not going to burn a spotless horse because the Vedas are reported to have advised, tolerated, or sanctioned the sacrifice. For me the Vedas are divine and unwritten. ‘The letter killeth.’ It is the spirit that giveth the light. And the spirit of the Vedas is purity, truth, innocence, chastity, humility, simplicity, forgiveness, godliness, and all that makes a man or woman noble and brave. There is neither nobility nor bravery in treating the great and uncomplaining scavengers of the nation as worse than dogs to be despised and spat upon. Would that God gave us the strength and the wisdom to become voluntary scavengers of the nation as the ‘suppressed’ classes are forced to be. There are Augean stables enough and to spare for us to clean.
U||VII. TREATMENT OF INDIANS ABROAD
U||INDIANS ABROAD
U||The prejudice against Indian settlers outside India is showing itself in a variety of ways: Under the impudent suggestion of sedition the Fiji Government has deported Mr. Manilal Doctor who with his brave and cultured wife has been rendering assistance to the poor indentured Indians of Fiji in a variety of ways. The whole trouble has arisen over the strike of the labourers in Fiji. Indentures have been canceled, but the spirit of slavery is by no means dead. We do not know the genesis of the strike; we do not know that the strikers have done no wrong. But we do know what is behind when a charge of sedition is brought against the strikers and their friends. The readers must remember that the Government that has scented sedition in the recent upheaval in Fiji is the Government that had the hardihood to libel Mr. Andrew’s character. What can be the meaning of sedition in connection with the Fiji strikers and Mr. Manilal Doctor? Did they and he want to seize the reins of Government? Did they want any power in 
U||that country? They struck for elementary freedom. And it is a prostitution of terms to use the word sedition in such connection. The strikers may have been overhasty. Mr. Manilal Doctor may have misled them. If his advice bordered on the criminal he should have been tried. The information in our possession goes to show that he has been strictly constitutional. Our point, however, is that it is an abuse of power for the Fiji Government to have deported Mr. Manilal Doctor without a trial. It is wrong in principle to deprive a person of his liberty on mere suspicion and without giving him an opportunity of clearing his character. Mr. Manilal Doctor, be it remembered, has for years past made Fiji his home. He has, we believe, bought property there. He has children born in Fiji. Have the children no rights? Has the wife none? May a promising career be ruined at the bidding of a lawless Government? Has Mr. Manilal Doctor been compensated for the losses he must sustain? We trust that the Government of India which h
U||as endeavoured to protect the rights of Indian settlers abroad will take up the question of Mr. Doctor’s deportation.
U||Nor is Fiji the only place where the spirit of lawlessness among the powerful has come to the surface. Indians of (the late) German East Africa find themselves in a worse position than heretofore. They state that even their property is not safe. They have to pay all kinds of dues on passports. They are hampered in their trade. They are not able even to send money orders.
U||In British East Africa the cloud is perhaps the thickest. The European settlers there are doing their utmost to deprive the Indian settlers of practically every right they have hitherto possessed. An attempt is being made to compass their ruin both by legislative enactment and administrative action.
U||In South Africa every Indian who has anything to do with that part of the British Dominions is watching with bated breath the progress of commission that is now sitting.
U||The Government of India have no easy job in protecting the interests of Indian settlers in these various parts of His Majesty’s dominions. They will be able to do so only by following the firmest and the most consistent policy. Justice is admittedly on the side of the Indian settlers. But they are the weak party. A strong agitation in India followed by strong action by the Government of India can alone save the situation.
U||INDIANS OVERSEAS
U||The meeting held at the Excelsior Theatre in Bombay to pass resolutions regarding East Africa and Fiji, and presided over by Sir Narayan Chandavarkar, was an impressive gathering. The Theatre was filled to overflowing. Mr. Andrews’ speech made clear what is needed. Both the political and the civil rights of Indians of East Africa are at stake. Mr. Anantani, himself an East African settler, showed in a forceful speech that the Indians were the pioneer settlers. An Indian sailor named Kano directed the celebrated Vasco De Gama to India. He added amid applause that Stanley’s expedition for the search and relief of Dr. Livingstone was also fitted out by Indians. Indian workmen had built the Uganda Railway at much peril to their lives. An Indian contractor had taken the contract. Indian artisans had supplied the skill. And now their countrymen were in danger of being debarred from its use.
U||The uplands of East Africa have been declared a Colony and the lowlands a Protectorate. There is a sinister significance attached to the declaration. The Colonial system gives the Europeans larger powers. It will tax all the resources of the Government of India to prevent the healthy uplands from becoming a whiteman’s preserve and the Indians from being relegated to the swampy lowlands.
U||The question of franchise will soon become a burning one. It will be suicidal to divide the electorate or to appoint Indians by nomination. There must be one general electoral roll applying the same qualifications to all the voters. This principle, as Mr. Andrews reminded the meeting, had worked well at the Cape.
U||The second part of the East African resolution shows the condition of our countrymen in the late German East Africa. Indian soldiers fought there and now the position of Indians is worse than under German rule. H.H. the Agakhan suggested that German East Africa should be administered from India. Sir Theodore Morison would have couped up all Indians in German East Africa. The result was that both the proposals went by the board and the expected has happened. The greed of the English speculator has prevailed and he is trying to squeeze out the Indian. What will the Government of India protect? Has it the will to do so? Is not India itself being exploited? Mr. Jehangir Petit recalled the late Mr. Gokhale’s views that we were not to expect a full satisfaction regarding the status of our countrymen across the seas until we had put our own house in order. Helots in our own country, how could we do better outside? Mr. Petit wants systematic and severe retaliation. In my opinion, retaliation is a double-edged weap
U||on. It does not fail to hurt the user if it also hurts the party against whom it is used. And who is to give effect to retaliation? It is too much to expect an English Government to adopt effective retaliation against their own people. They will expostulate, they will remonstrate, but they will not go to war with their own Colonies. For the logical outcome of retaliation must mean war, if retaliation will not answer.
U||Let us face the facts frankly. The problem is difficult alike for Englishmen and for us. The Englishmen and Indians do not agree in the Colonies. The Englishmen do not want us where they can live. Their civilisation is different from ours. The two cannot coalesce until there is mutual respect. The Englishman considers himself to belong to the ruling race. The Indian struggles to think that he does not belong to the subject race and in the very act of thinking admits his subjection. We must then attain equality at home before we can make any real impression abroad.
U||This is not to say that we must not strive to do better abroad whilst we are ill at ease in our own home. We must preserve, we must help our countrymen who have settled outside India. Only if we recognise the true situation, we and our countrymen abroad will learn to be patient and know that our chief energy must be concentrated on a betterment of our position at home. If we can raise our status here to that of equal partners not in name but in reality so that every Indian might feel it, all else must follow as a matter of course.
U||PARIAHS OF THE EMPIRE
U||The memorable Conference at Gujrat in its resolution on the status of Indians abroad has given it as its opinion that even this question may become one more reason for non-co-operation. And so it may. Nowhere has there been such open defiance of every canon of justice and propriety as in the shameless decision of confiscation of Indian rights in the Kenia Colony announced by its Governor. This decision has been supported by Lord Milnor and Mr. Montagu. And his Indian colleagues are satisfied with the decision. Indians, who have made East Africa, who out-number the English, are deprived practically of the right of representation on the Council. They are to be segregated in parts not habitable by the English. They are to have neither the political nor the material comfort. They are to become ‘Pariahs’ in a country made by their own labour, wealth and intelligence. The Viceroy is pleased to say that he does not like the outlook and is considering the steps to be taken to vindicate the justice. He is not met
U|| with a new situation. The Indians of East Africa had warned him of the impending doom. And if His Excellency has not yet found the means of ensuring redress, he is not likely to do it in future. I would respectfully ask his Indian colleagues whether they can stand this robbery of their countrymen rights.
U||In South Africa the situation is not less disquieting. My misgivings seem to be proving true, and repatriation is more likely to prove compulsory than voluntary. It is a response to the anti-Asiatic agitation, not a measure of relief for indigent Indians. It looks very like a trap laid for the unwary Indian. The Union Government appears to be taking an unlawful advantage of a section of a relieving law designed for a purpose totally different from the one now intended.
U||As for Fiji, the crime against humanity is evidently to be hushed up. I do hope that unless an inquiry is to be made into the Fiji Martial Law doings, no Indian member will undertake to go to Fiji. The Government of India appear to have given an undertaking to send Indian labour to Fiji provided the commission that was to proceed there in order to investigate the condition on the spot returns with a favourable report.
U||For British Guiana I observe from the papers received from that quarter, that the mission that came here is already declaring that Indian labour will be forthcoming from India. There seems to me to be no real prospect for Indian enterprise in that part of the world. We are not wanted in any part of the British Dominion except as Pariahs to do the scavenging for the European settlers.
U||The situation is clear. We are Pariahs in our own home. We get only what Government intend to give, not what we demand and have a right to. We may get the crumbs, never the loaf. I have seen large and tempting crumbs from a lavish table. And I have seen the eyes of our Pariahs—the shame of Hinduism—brightening to see those heavy crumbs filling their baskets. But the superior Hindu, who is filling the basket from a safe distance, knows that they are unfit for his own consumption. And so we in our turn may receive even Governorships which the real rulers no longer require or which they cannot retain with safety for their material interest—the political and material hold on India. It is time we realised our true status.
U||VIII. NON-CO-OPERATION
U||A writer in the “Times of India,” the Editor of that wonderful daily and Mrs. Besant have all in their own manner condemned non-co-operation conceived in connection with the Khilafat movement. All the three writings naturally discuss many side issues which I shall omit for the time being. I propose to answer two serious objections raised by the writers. The sobriety with which they are stated entitles them to a greater consideration than if they had been given in violent language. In non-co-operation, the writers think, it would be difficult if not impossible to avoid violence. Indeed violence, the “Times of India” editorial says, has already commenced in that ostracism has been resorted to in Calcutta and Delhi. Now I fear that ostracism to a certain extent is impossible to avoid. I remember in South Africa in the initial stages of the passive resistance campaign those who had fallen away were ostracised. Ostracism is violent or peaceful in according to the manner in which it is practised. A congreg
U||ation may well refuse to recite prayers after a priest who prizes his title above his honour. But the ostracism will become violent if the individual life of a person is made unbearable by insults innuendoes or abuse. The real danger of violence lies in the people resorting to non-co-operation becoming impatient and revengeful. This may happen, if, for instance, payment of taxes is suddenly withdrawn or if pressure is put upon soldiers to lay down their arms. I however do not fear any evil consequences, for the simple reason that every responsible Mahomedan understands that non-co-operation to be successful must be totally unattended with violence. The other objection raised is that those who may give up their service may have to starve. That is just a possibility but a remote one, for the committee will certainly make due provision for those who may suddenly find themselves out of employment. I propose however to examine the whole of the difficult question much more fully in a future issue and hope to show 
U||that if Indian-Mahomedan feeling is to be respected, there is nothing left but non-co-operation if the decision arrived at is adverse.
U||MR. MONTAGU ON THE KHILAFAT AGITATION
U||Mr. Montagu does not like the Khilafat agitation that is daily gathering force. In answer to questions put in the House of Commons, he is reported to have said that whilst he acknowledged that I had rendered distinguished services to the country in the past, he could not look upon my present attitude with equanimity and that it was not to be expected that I could now be treated as leniently as I was during the Rowlatt Act agitation. He added that he had every confidence in the central and the local Governments, that they were carefully watching the movement and that they had full power to deal with the situation.
U||This statement of Mr. Montagu has been regarded in some quarters as a threat. It has even been considered to be a blank cheque for the Government of India to re-establish the reign of terror if they chose. It is certainly inconsistent with his desire to base the Government on the goodwill of the people. At the same time if the Hunter Committee’s finding be true and if I was the cause of the disturbances last year, I was undoubtedly treated with exceptional leniency, I admit too that my activity this year is fraught with greater peril to the Empire as it is being conducted to-day than was last year’s activity. Non-co-operation in itself is more harmless than civil disobedience, but in its effect it is far more dangerous for the Government than civil disobedience. Non-co-operation is intended so far to paralyse the Government, as to compel justice from it. If it is carried to the extreme point, it can bring the Government to a standstill.
U||A friend who has been listening to my speeches once asked me whether I did not come under the sedition section of the Indian Penal Code. Though I had not fully considered it, I told him that very probably I did and that I could not plead ‘not guilty’ if I was charged under it. For I must admit that I can pretend to no ‘affection’ for the present Government. And my speeches are intended to create ‘disaffection’ such that the people might consider it a shame to assist or co-operate with a Government that had forfeited all title to confidence, respect or support.
U||I draw no distinction between the Imperial and the Indian Government. The latter has accepted, on the Khilafat, the policy imposed upon it by the former. And in the Punjab case the former has endorsed the policy of terrorism and emasculation of a brave people initiated by the latter. British ministers have broken their pledged word and wantonly wounded the feelings of the seventy million Mussulmans of India. Innocent men and women were insulted by the insolent officers of the Punjab Government. Their wrongs not only unrighted but the very officers who so cruelly subjected them to barbarous humiliation retain office under the Government.
U||When at Amritsar last year I pleaded with all the earnestness I could command for co-operation with the Government and for response to the wishes expressed in the Royal Proclamation; I did so because I honestly believed that a new era was about to begin, and that the old spirit of fear, distrust and consequent terrorism was about to give place to the new spirit of respect, trust and good-will. I sincerely believed that the Mussalman sentiment would be placated and that the officers that had misbehaved during the Martial Law regime in the Punjab would be at least dismissed and the people would be otherwise made to feel that a Government that had always been found quick (and rightly) to punish popular excesses would not fail to punish its agents’ misdeeds. But to my amazement and dismay I have discovered that the present representatives of the Empire have become dishonest and unscrupulous. They have no real regard for the wishes of the people of India and they count Indian honour as of little consequence.
U||I can no longer retain affection for a Government so evilly manned as it is now-a-days. And for me, it is humiliating to retain my freedom and be a witness to the continuing wrong. Mr. Montagu however is certainly right in threatening me with deprivation of my liberty if I persist in endangering the existence of the Government. For that must be the result if my activity bears fruit. My only regret is that inasmuch as Mr. Montagu admits my past services, he might have perceived that there must be something exceptionally bad in the Government if a well-wisher like me could no longer give his affection to it. It was simpler to insist on justice being done to the Mussulmans and to the Punjab than to threaten me with punishment so that the injustice might be perpetuated. Indeed I fully expect it will be found that even in promoting disaffection towards an unjust Government I have rendered greater services to the Empire than I am already credited with.
U||At the present moment, however, the duty of those who approve of my activity is clear. They ought on no account to resent the deprivation of my liberty, should the Government of India deem it to be their duty to take it away. A citizen has no right to resist such restriction imposed in accordance with the laws of the State to which he belongs. Much less have those who sympathize with him. In my case there can be no question of sympathy. For I deliberately oppose the Government to the extent of trying to put its very existence in jeopardy. For my supporters, therefore, it must be a moment of joy when I am imprisoned. It means the beginning of success if only the supporters continue the policy for which I stand. If the Government arrest me, they would do so in order to stop the progress of non-co-operation which I preach. It follows that if non-co-operation continues with unabated vigour, even after my arrest, the Government must imprison others or grant the people’s wish in order to gain their co-operation.
U|| Any eruption of violence on the part of the people even under provocation would end in disaster. Whether therefore it is I or any one else who is arrested during the campaign, the first condition of success is that there must be no resentment shown against it. We cannot imperil the very existence of a Government and quarrel with its attempt to save itself by punishing those who place it in danger.
U||AT THE CALL OF THE COUNTRY
U||Dr. Sapru delivered before the Khilafat Conference at Allahabad an impassioned address sympathising with the Mussulmans in their trouble but dissuaded them from embarking on non-co-operation. He was frankly unable to suggest a substitute but was emphatically of opinion that whether there was a substitute or not non-co-operation was a remedy worse than the disease. He said further that Mussulmans will be taking upon their shoulders, a serious responsibility, if whilst they appealed to the ignorant masses to join them, they could not appeal to the Indian judges to resign and if they did they would not succeed.
U||I acknowledge the force of Dr. Sapru’s last argument. At the back of Dr. Sapru’s mind is the fear that non-co-operation by the ignorant people would lead to distress and chaos and would do no good. In my opinion any non-co-operation is bound to do some good. Even the Viceragal door-keeper saying, ‘Please Sir, I can serve the Government no longer because it has hurt my national honour’ and resigning is a step mightier and more effective than the mightiest speech declaiming against the Government for its injustice.
U||Nevertheless it would be wrong to appeal to the door-keeper until one has appealed to the highest in the land. And as I propose, if the necessity arose, to ask the door-keepers of the Government to dissociate themselves from an unjust Government I propose now to address, an appeal to the Judges and the Executive Councillors to join the protest that is rising from all over India against the double wrong done to India, on the Khilafat and the Punjab question. In both, national honour is involved.
U||I take it that these gentlemen have entered upon their high offices not for the sake of emolument, nor I hope for the sake of fame, but for the sake of serving their country. It was not for money, for they were earning more than they do now. It must not be for fame, for they cannot buy fame at the cost of national honour. The only consideration, that can at the present moment keep them in office must be service of the country.
U||When the people have faith in the government, when it represents the popular will, the judges and the executive officials possibly serve the country. But when that government does not represent the will of the people, when it supports dishonesty and terrorism, the judges and the executive officials by retaining office become instrument of dishonesty and terrorism. And the least therefore that these holders of high offices can do is to cease to become agents of a dishonest and terrorising government.
U||For the judges, the objection will be raised that they are above politics, and so they are and should be. But the doctrine is true only in so far as the government is on the whole for the benefit of the people and at least represents the will of the majority. Not to take part in politics means not to take sides. But when a whole country has one mind, one will, when a whole country has been denied justice, it is no longer a question of party politics, it is a matter of life and death. It then becomes the duty of every citizen to refuse to serve a government which misbehaves and flouts national wish. The judges are at that moment bound to follow the nation if they are ultimately its servants.
U||There remains another argument to be examined. It applies to both the judges and the members of the executive. It will be urged that my appeal could only be meant for the Indians and what good can it do by Indians renouncing offices which have been won for the nation by hard struggle. I wish that I could make an effective appeal to the English as well as the Indians. But I confess that I have written with the mental reservation that the appeal is addressed only to the Indians. I must therefore examine the argument just stated. Whilst it is true that these offices have been secured after a prolonged struggle, they are of use not because of the struggle, but because they are intended to serve the nation. The moment they cease to possess that quality, they become useless and as in the present case harmful, no matter how hard-earned and therefore valuable they may have been at the outset.
U||I would submit too to our distinguished countrymen who occupy high offices that their giving up will bring the struggle to a speedy end and would probably obviate the danger attendant upon the masses being called upon to signify their disapproval by withdrawing co-operation. If the titleholders gave up their titles, if the holders of honorary offices gave up their appointment and if the high officials gave up their posts, and the would-be councillors boycotted the councils, the Government would quickly come to its senses and give effect to the people’s will. For the alternative before the Government then would be nothing but despotic rule pure and simple. That would probably mean military dictatorship. The world’s opinion has advanced so far that Britain dare not contemplate such dictatorship with equanimity. The taking of the steps suggested by me will constitute the peacefullest revolution the world has ever seen. Once the infallibility of non-co-operation is realised, there is an end to all bloodshed 
U||and violence in any shape or form.
U||Undoubtedly a cause must be grave to warrant the drastic method of national non-co-operation. I do say that the affront such as has been put upon Islam cannot be repeated for a century. Islam must rise now or ‘be fallen’ if not for ever, certainly for a century. And I cannot imagine a graver wrong than the massacre of Jallianwalla and the barbarity that followed it, the whitewash by the Hunter Committee, the dispatch of the Government of India, Mr. Montagu’s letter upholding the Viceroy and the then Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab, the refusal to remove officials who made of the lives of the Punjabis ‘a hell’ during the Martial Law period. These act constitute a complete series of continuing wrongs against India which if India has any sense of honour, she must right at the sacrifice of all the material wealth she possesses. If she does not, she will have bartered her soul for a ‘mess of pottage.’
U||NON-CO-OPERATION EXPLAINED
U||A representative of Madras Mail called on Mr. M.K. Gandhi at his temporary residence in the Pursewalkam High road for an interview on the subject of non-co-operation. Mr. Gandhi, who has come to Madras on a tour to some of the principal Muslim centres in Southern India, was busy with a number of workers discussing his programme; but he expressed his readiness to answer questions on the chief topic which is agitating Muslims and Hindus.
U||“After your experience of the Satyagraha agitation last year, Mr. Gandhi, are you still hopeful and convinced of the wisdom of advising non-co-operation?”—“Certainly.”
U||“How do you consider conditions have altered since the Satyagraha movement of last year?”—“I consider that people are better disciplined now than they were before. In this I include even the masses who I have had opportunities of seeing in large numbers in various parts of the country.”
U||“And you are satisfied that the masses understand the spirit of Satyagraha?”—“Yes.”
U||“And that is why you are pressing on with the programme of non-co-operation?”—“Yes. Moreover, the danger that attended the civil disobedience part of Satyagraha does not apply to non-co-operation, because in non-co-operation we are not taking up civil disobedience of laws as a mass movement. The result hitherto has been most encouraging. For instance, people in Sindh and Delhi in spite of the irritating restrictions upon their liberty by the authorities have carried out the Committee’s instructions in regard to the Seditious Meetings Proclamation and to the prohibition of posting placards on the walls which we hold to be inoffensive but which the authorities consider to be offensive.”
U||“What is the pressure which you expect to bring to bear on the authorities if co-operation is withdrawn?”—“I believe, and everybody must grant, that no Government can exist for a single moment without the co-operation of the people, willing or forced, and if people suddenly withdraw their co-operation in every detail, the Government will come to a stand-still.”
U||“But is there not a big ‘If’ in it?”—“Certainly there is.”
U||“And how do you propose to succeed against the big ‘If’?”—“In my plan of campaign expediency has no room. If the Khilafat movement has really permeated the masses and the classes, there must be adequate response from the people.”
U||“But are you not begging the question?”—“I am not begging the question, because so far as the data before me go, I believe that the Muslims keenly feel the Khilafat grievance. It remains to be seen whether their feeling is intense enough to evoke in them the measure of sacrifice adequate for successful non-co-operation.”
U||“That is, your survey of the conditions, you think, justifies your advising non-co-operation in the full conviction that you have behind you the support of the vast masses of the Mussalman population?”—“Yes.”
U||“This non-co-operation, you are satisfied, will extend to complete severance of co-operation with the Government?”—No; nor is it at the present moment my desire that it should. I am simply practising non-co-operation to the extent that is necessary to make the Government realise the depth of popular feeling in the matter and the dissatisfaction with the Government that all that could be done has not been done either by the Government of India or by the Imperial Government, whether on the Khilafat question or on the “Punjab question.”
U||“Do you Mr. Gandhi, realise that even amongst Mahomedans there are sections of people who are not enthusiastic over non-co-operation however much they may feel the wrong that has been done to their community?”—“Yes. But their number is smaller than those who are prepared to adopt non-co-operation.”
U||“And yet does not the fact that there has not been an adequate response to your appeal for resignation of titles and offices and for boycott of elections of the Councils indicate that you may be placing more faith in their strength of conviction than is warranted?”—“I think not; for the reason that the stage has only just come into operation and our people are always most cautious and slow to move. Moreover, the first stage largely affects the uppermost strata of society, who represent a microscopic minority though they are undoubtedly an influential body of people.”
U||“This upper class, you think, has sufficiently responded to your appeal?”—“I am unable to say either one way or the other at present. I shall be able to give a definite answer at the end of this month.”...
U||“Do you think that without one’s loyalty to the King and the Royal Family being questioned, one can advocate non-co-operation in connection with the Royal visit?” “Most decidedly; for the simple reason that if there is any disloyalty about the proposed boycott of the Prince’s visit, it is disloyalty to the Government of the day and not to the person of His Royal highness.”
U||“What do you think is to be gained by promoting this boycott in connection with the Royal visit?”—“Because I want to show that the people of India are not in sympathy with the Government of the day and that they strongly disapprove of the policy of the Government in regard to the Punjab and Khilafat, and even in respect of other important administrative measures. I consider that the visit of the Prince of Wales is a singularly good opportunity to the people to show their disapproval of the present Government. After all, the visit is calculated to have tremendous political results. It is not to be a non-political event, and seeing that the Government of India and the Imperial Government want to make the visit a political event of first class importance, namely, for the purpose of strengthening their hold upon India, I for one, consider that it is the bounden duty of the people to boycott the visit which is being engineered by the two Governments in their own interest which at the present moment is tot
U||ally antagonistic to the people.”
U||“Do you mean that you want this boycott promoted because you feel that the strengthening of the hold upon India is not desirable in the best interests of the country?”—“Yes. The strengthening of the hold of a Government so wicked as the present one is not desirable for the best interests of the people. Not that I want the bond between England and India to become loosened for the sake of loosening it but I want that bond to become strengthened only in so far as it adds to the welfare of India.”
U||“Do you think that non-co-operation and the non-boycott of the Legislative Councils consistent?”—“No; because a person who takes up the programme of non-co-operation cannot consistently stand for Councils.”
U||“Is non-co-operation, in your opinion, an end in itself or a means to an end, and if so, what is the end?” “It is a means to an end, the end being to make the present Government just, whereas it has become mostly unjust. Co-operation with a just Government is a duty; non-co-operation with an unjust Government is equally a duty.”
U||“Will you look with favour upon the proposal to enter the Councils and to carry on either obstructive tactics or to decline to take the oath of allegiance consistent with your non-co-operation?”—“No; as an accurate student of non-co-operation, I consider that such a proposal is inconsistent with the true spirit of non-co-operation. I have often said that a Government really thrives on obstruction and so far as the proposal not to take the oath of allegiance is concerned, I can really see no meaning in it; it amounts to a useless waste of valuable time and money.”
U||“In other words, obstruction is no stage in non-co-operation?” —“No,”....
U||“Are you satisfied that all efforts at constitutional agitation have been exhausted and that non-co-operation is the only course left us?” “I do not consider non-co-operation to be unconstitutional remedies now left open to us, non-co-operation is the only one left for us.” “Do you consider it constitutional to adopt it with a view merely to paralyse Government?”—“Certainly, it is not unconstitutional, but a prudent man will not take all the steps that are constitutional if they are otherwise undesirable, nor do I advise that course. I am resorting to non-co-operation in progressive stages because I want to evolve true order out of untrue order. I am not going to take a single step in non-co-operation unless I am satisfied that the country is ready for that step, namely, non-co-operation will not be followed by anarchy or disorder.”
U||“How will you satisfy yourself anarchy will not follow?”
U||“For instance, if I advise the police to lay down their arms, I shall have satisfied myself that we are able by voluntary assistance to protect ourselves against thieves and robbers. That was precisely what was done in Lahore and Amritsar last year by the citizens by means of volunteers when the Military and the police had withdrawn. Even where Government had not taken such measures in a place, for want of adequate force, I know people have successfully protected themselves.”
U||“You have advised lawyers to non-co-operate by suspending their practice. What is your experience? Has the lawyers’ response to your appeal encouraged you to hope that you will be able to carry through all stages of non-co-operation with the help of such people?”
U||“I cannot say that a large number has yet responded to my appeal. It is too early to say how many will respond. But I may say that I do not rely merely upon the lawyer class or highly educated men to enable the Committee to carry out all the stages of non-co-operation. My hope lies more with the masses so far as the later stages of non-co-operation are concerned.”
U||August 1920.
U||RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY FOR NON-CO-OPERATION
U||It is not without the greatest reluctance that I engage in a controversy with so learned a leader like Sir Narayan Chandavarkar. But in view of the fact that I am the author of the movement of non-co-operation, it becomes my painful duty to state my views even though they are opposed to those of the leaders whom I look upon with respect. I have just read during my travels in Malabar Sir Narayan’s rejoinder to my answer to the Bombay manifesto against non-co-operation. I regret to have to say that the rejoinder leaves me unconvinced. He and I seem to read the teachings of the Bible, the Gita and the Koran from different standpoints or we put different interpretations on them. We seem to understand the words Ahimsa, politics and religion differently. I shall try my best to make clear my meaning of the common terms and my reading of the different religious.
U||At the outset let me assure Sir Narayan that I have not changed my views on Ahimsa. I still believe that man not having been given the power of creation does not possess the right of destroying the meanest creature that lives. The prerogative of destruction belongs solely to the creator of all that lives. I accept the interpretation of Ahimsa, namely, that it is not merely a negative State of harmlessness, but it is a positive state of love, of doing good even to the evil-doer. But it does not mean helping the evil-doer to continue the wrong or tolerating it by passive acquiescence. On the contrary love, the active state of Ahimsa, requires you to resist the wrong-doer by dissociating yourself from him even though it may offend him or injure him physically. Thus if my son lives a life of shame, I may not help him to do so by continuing to support him; on the contrary, my love for him requires me to withdraw all support from him although it may mean even his death. And the same love imposes on me the obligati
U||on of welcoming him to my bosom when he repents. But I may not by physical force compel my son to become good. That in my opinion is the moral of the story of the Prodigal Son.
U||Non-co-operation is not a passive state, it is an intensely active state—more active than physical resistance or violence. Passive resistance is a misnomer. Non-co-operation in the sense used by me must be non-violent and therefore neither punitive nor vindictive nor based on malice ill-will or hatred. It follows therefore that it would be sin for me to serve General Dyer and co-operate with him to shoot innocent men. But it will be an exercise of forgiveness or love for me to nurse him back to life, if he was suffering from a physical malady. I cannot use in this context the word co-operation as Sir Narayan would perhaps use it. I would co-operate a thousand times with this Government to wean it from its career of crime but I will not for a single moment co-operate with it to continue that career. And I would be guilty of wrong doing if I retained a title from it or “a service under it or supported its law-courts or schools.” Better for me a beggar’s bowl than the richest possession from hands stain
U||ed with the blood of the innocents of Jallianwala. Better by far a warrant of imprisonment than honeyed words from those who have wantonly wounded the religious sentiment of my seventy million brothers.
U||My reading of the Gita is diametrically opposed to Sir Narayan’s. I do not believe that the Gita teaches violence for doing good. It is pre-eminently a description of the duel that goes on in our own hearts. The divine author has used a historical incident for inculcating the lesson of doing one’s duty even at the peril of one’s life. It inculcates performance of duty irrespective of the consequences, for, we mortals, limited by our physical frames, are incapable of controlling actions save our own. The Gita distinguishes between the powers of light and darkness and demonstrates their incompatibility.
U||Jesus, in my humble opinion, was a prince among politicians. He did render unto Caesar that which was Caesar’s. He gave the devil his due. He ever shunned him and is reported never once to have yielded to his incantations. The politics of his time consisted in securing the welfare of the people by teaching them not to be seduced by the trinkets of the priests and the pharisees. The latter then controlled and moulded the life of the people. To-day the system of government is so devised as to affect every department of our life. It threatens our very existence. If therefore we want to conserve the welfare of the nation, we must religiously interest ourselves in the doing of the governors and exert a moral influence on them by insisting on their obeying the laws of morality. General Dyer did produce a ‘moral effect’ by an act of butchery. Those who are engaged in forwarding the movement of non-co-operation, hope to produce a moral effect by a process of self-denial, self-sacrifice and self-purification. I
U||t surprises me that Sir Narayan should speak of General Dyer’s massacre in the same breath as acts of non-co-operation. I have done my best to understand his meaning, but I am sorry to confess that I have failed.
U||THE INWARDNESS OF NON-CO-OPERATION
U||I commend to the attention of the readers the thoughtful letter received from Miss Anne Marie Peterson. Miss Peterson is a lady who has been in India for some years and has closely followed Indian affairs. She is about to sever her connection with her mission for the purpose of giving herself to education that is truly national.
U||I have not given the letter in full. I have omitted all personal references. But her argument has been left entirely untouched. The letter was not meant to be printed. It was written just after my Vellore speech. But it being intrinsically important, I asked the writer for her permission, which she gladly gave, for printing it.
U||I publish it all the more gladly in that it enables me to show that the movement of non-co-operation is neither anti-Christian nor anti-English nor anti-European. It is a struggle between religion and irreligion, powers of light and powers of darkness.
U||It is my firm opinion that Europe to-day represents not the spirit of God or Christianity but the spirit of Satan. And Satan’s successes are the greatest when he appears with the name of God on his lips. Europe is to-day only nominally Christian. In reality it is worshipping Mammon. ‘It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom.’ Thus really spoke Jesus Christ. His so-called followers measure their moral progress by their material possessions. The very national anthem of England is anti-Christian. Jesus who asked his followers to love their enemies even as themselves, could not have sung of his enemies, ‘confound his enemies frustrate their knavish tricks.’ The last book that Dr. Wallace wrote set forth his deliberate conviction that the much vaunted advance of science had added not an inch to the moral stature of Europe. The last war however has shown, as nothing else has, the Satanic nature of the civilization that dominates Europe to day. 
U||Every canon of public morality has been broken by the victors in the name of virtue. No lie has been considered too foul to be uttered. The motive behind every crime is not religious or spiritual but grossly material. But the Mussalmans and the Hindus who are struggling against the Government have religion and honour as their motive. Even the cruel assassination which has just shocked the country is reported to have a religious motive behind it. It is certainly necessary to purge religion of its excrescences, but it is equally necessary to expose the hollowness of moral pretensions on the part of those who prefer material wealth to moral gain. It is easier to wean an ignorant fanatic from his error than a confirmed scoundrel from his scoundrelism.
U||This however is no indictment against individuals or even nations. Thousands of individual Europeans are rising above their environment. I write of the tendency in Europe as reflected in her present leaders. England through her leaders is insolently crushing Indian religious and national sentiment under her heels. England under the false plea of self-determination is trying to exploit the oil fields of Mesopotamia which she is almost to leave because she has probably no choice. France through her leaders is lending her name to training Cannibals as soldiers and is shamelessly betraying her trust as a mandatory power by trying to kill the spirit of the Syrians. President Wilson has thrown on the scrap heap his precious fourteen points.
U||It is this combination of evil forces which India is really fighting through non-violent non-cooperation. And those like Miss Peterson whether Christian or European, who feel that this error must be dethroned can exercise the privilege of doing so by joining the non-co-operation movement. With the honour of Islam is bound up the safety of religion itself and with the honour of India is bound up the honour of every nation known to be weak.
U||A MISSIONARY ON NON-CO-OPERATION
U||The following letter has been received by Mr. Gandhi from Miss Anne Marie Peterson of the Danish Mission in Madras:—
U||Dear Mr. Gandhi,
U||I cannot thank you enough for your kindness and the way in which you received me and I feel that meeting more or less decided my future. I have thrown myself at the feet of India. At the same time I know that in Christ alone is my abode and I have no longing and no desire but to live Him, my crucified Saviour, and reveal Him for those with whom I come in contact. I just cling to his feet and pray with tears that I may not disgrace him as we Christians have been doing by our behaviour in India. We go on crucifying Christ while we long to proclaim the Power of His resurrection by which He has conquered untruth and unrighteousness. If we who bear His name were true to Him, we would never bow ourselves before the Powers of this world, but we would always be on the side of the poor, the suffering and the oppressed. But we are not and therefore I feel myself under obligation and only to Christ but to India for His sake at this time of momentous importance for her future.
U||Truly it matters little what I, a lonely and insignificant person, may say or do. What is my protest against the common current, the race to which I belong is taking and (what grieves me more), which the missionary societies seem to follow? Even if a respectable number protested it would not be of any use. Yet were I alone against the whole world, I must follow my conscience and my God.
U||I therefore cannot but smile when I see people saying, you should have awaited the decision of the National Congress before starting the non-co-operation movement. You have a message for the country, and the Congress is the voice of the nation—its servant and not its master. A majority has no right simply because it is a majority.
U||But we must try to win the majority. And it is easy to see that now that Congress is going to be with you. Would it have done so if you had kept quiet and not lent your voice to the feelings of the people? Would the Congress have known its mind? I think not.
U||I myself was in much doubt before I heard you. But you convinced me. Not that I can feel much on the question of the Khilafat. I cannot. I can see what service you are doing to India, if you can prevent the Mahomedans from using the sword in order to take revenge and get their rights. I can see that if you unite the Hindus and the Mahomedans, it will be a master stroke. How I wish the Christian would also come forward and unite with you for the sake of their country and the honour not only of their Motherland but of Christ. I may not feel much for Turkey, but I feel for India, and I can see she (India) has no other way to protest against being trampled down and crushed than non-co-operation.
U||I also want you to know that many in Denmark and all over the world, yes, I am sure every true Christian, will feel with and be in sympathy with India in the struggle which is now going on. God forbid that in the struggle between might and right, truth and untruth, the spirit and the flesh, there should be a division of races. There is not. The same struggle is going on all over the world. What does it matter then that we are a few? God is on our side.
U||Brute force often seems to get the upper hand but righteousness always has and always shall conquer, be it even through much suffering, and what may even appear to be a defeat. Christ conquered, when the world crucified Him. Blessed are the meek; they shall inherit the earth.
U||When I read your speech given at Madras it struck me that it should be printed as a pamphlet in English, Tamil, Hindustani and all the most used languages and then spread to every nook and corner of India.
U||The non-co-operation movement once started must be worked so as to become successful. If it is not, I dread to think of the consequences. But you cannot expect it to win in a day or two. It must take time and you will not despair if you do not reach your goal in a hurry. For those who have faith there is no haste.
U||Now for the withdrawal of the children and students from Government schools, I think, it a most important step. Taking the Government help (even if it be your money they pay you back), we must submit to its scheme, its rules and regulation. India and we who love her have come to the conclusion that the education the foreign Government has given you is not healthy for India and can certainly never make for her real growth. This movement would lead to a spontaneous rise of national schools. Let them be a few but let them spring up through self-sacrifice. Only by indigenous education can India be truly uplifted. Why this appeals so much to me is perhaps because I belong to the part of the Danish people who started their own independent, indigenous national schools. The Danish Free Schools and Folk-High-Schools, of which you may have heard, were started against the opposition and persecution of the State. The organisers won and thus have regenerated the nation. With my truly heartfelt thanks and prayers for you.
U||I am, Your sincerely, Anne Marie.
U||HOW TO WORK NON-CO-OPERATION
U||Perhaps the best way of answering the fears and criticism as to non-co-operation is to elaborate more fully the scheme of non-co-operation. The critics seem to imagine that the organisers propose to give effect to the whole scheme at once. The fact however is that the organisers have fixed definite, progressive four stages. The first is the giving up of titles and resignation of honorary posts. If there is no response or if the response received is not effective, recourse will be had to the second stage. The second stage involves much previous arrangement. Certainly not a single servant will be called out unless he is either capable of supporting himself and his dependents or the Khilafat Committee is able to bear the burden. All the classes of servants will not be called out at once and never will any pressure be put upon a single servant to withdraw himself from the Government service. Nor will a single private employee be touched for the simple reason that the movement is not anti-English. It is not even 
U||anti-Government. Co-operation is to be withdrawn because the people must not be party to a wrong—a broken pledge—a violation of deep religious sentiment. Naturally, the movement will receive a check, if there is any undue influence brought to bear upon any Government servant or if any violence is used or countenanced by any member of the Khilafat Committee. The second stage must be entirely successful, if the response is at all on an adequate scale. For no Government—much less the Indian Government—can subsist if the people cease to serve it. The withdrawal therefore of the police and the military—the third stage—is a distant goal. The organisers however wanted to be fair, open and above suspicion. They did not want to keep back from the Government or the public a single step they had in contemplation even as a remote contingency. The fourth, i.e., suspension of taxes is still more remote. The organisers recognise that suspension of general taxation is fraught with the greatest danger. It is like
U||ly to bring a sensitive class in conflict with the police. They are therefore not likely to embark upon it, unless they can do so with the assurance that there will be no violence offered by the people.
U||I admit as I have already done that non-co-operation is not unattended with risk, but the risk of supineness in the face of a grave issue is infinitely greater than the danger of violence ensuing form organizing non-co-operation. To do nothing is to invite violence for a certainty.
U||It is easy enough to pass resolutions or write articles condemning non-co-operation. But it is no easy task to restrain the fury of a people incensed by a deep sense of wrong. I urge those who talk or work against non-co-operation to descend from their chairs and go down to the people, learn their feelings and write, if they have the heart against non-co-operation. They will find, as I have found that the only way to avoid violence is to enable them to give such expression to their feelings as to compel redress. I have found nothing save non-co-operation. It is logical and harmless. It is the inherent right of a subject to refuse to assist a Government that will not listen to him.
U||Non-co-operation as a voluntary movement can only succeed, if the feeling is genuine and strong enough to make people suffer to the utmost. If the religious sentiment of the Mahomedans is deeply hurt and if the Hindus entertain neighbourly regard towards their Muslim brethren, they will both count no cost too great for achieving the end. Non-co-operation will not only be an effective remedy but will also be an effective test of the sincerity of the Muslim claim and the Hindu profession of friendship.
U||There is however one formidable argument urged by friends against my joining the Khilafat movement. They say that it ill-becomes me, a friend of the English and an admirer of the British constitution, to join hands with those who are to-day filled with nothing but ill-will against the English. I am sorry to have to confess that the ordinary Mahomedan entertains to-day no affection for Englishmen. He considers, not without some cause, that they have not played the game. But if I am friendly towards Englishmen, I am no less so towards my countrymen, the Mahomedans. And as such they have a greater claim upon my attention than Englishmen. My personal religion however enables me to serve my countrymen without hurting Englishmen or for that matter anybody else. What I am not prepared to do to my blood-brother I would not do to an Englishman, I would not injure him to gain a kingdom. But I would withdraw co-operation from him if it becomes necessary as I had withdrawn from my own brother (now deceased) when it beca
U||me necessary. I serve the Empire by refusing to partake in its wrong. William Stead offered public prayers for British reverses at the time of the Boer war because he considered that the nation to which he belonged was engaged in an unrighteous war. The present Prime Minister risked his life in opposing that war and did everything he could to obstruct his own Government in its prosecution. And to-day if I have thrown in my lot with the Mahomedans, a large number of whom, bear no friendly feelings towards the British, I have done so frankly as a friend of the British and with the object of gaining justice and of thereby showing the capacity of the British constitution to respond to every honest determination when it is coupled with suffering, I hope by my ‘alliance’ with the Mahomedans to achieve a threefold end—to obtain justice in the face of odds with the method of Satyagrah and to show its efficacy over all other methods, to secure Mahomedan friendship for the Hindus and thereby internal peace also,
U|| and last but not least to transform ill-will into affection for the British and their constitution which in spite of the imperfections weathered many a storm. I may fail in achieving any of the ends. I can but attempt. God alone can grant success. It will not be denied that the ends are all worthy. I invite Hindus and Englishman to join me in a full-hearted manner in shouldering the burden the Mahomedans of India are carrying. Theirs is admittedly a just fight. The Viceroy, the Secretary of State, the Maharaja of Bikuner and Lord Sinha have testified to it. Time has arrived to make good the testimony. People with a just cause are never satisfied with a mere protest. They have been known to die for it. Are a high-spirited people like the Mahomedans expected to do less?
U||SPEECH AT MADRAS
U||Addressing a huge concourse of people of the city of Madras Hindus and Mahomedans numbering over 50,000, assembled on the South Beach opposite to the Presidency College, Madras, on the 12th August 1920, Mahatma Gandhi spoke as follows:—
U||Mr. Chairman and Friends,—Like last year, I have to ask your forgiveness that I should have to speak being seated. Whilst my voice has become stronger than it was last year, my body is still weak; and if I were to attempt to speak to you standing, I could not hold on for very many minutes before the whole frame would shake. I hope, therefore, that you will grant me permission to speak seated. I have sat here to address you on a most important question, probably a question whose importance we have not measured up to now.
U||LOKAMANYA TILAK
U||But before I approach that question on this dear old beach of Madras, you will expect me—you will want me—to offer my tribute to the great departed, Lokamanya Tilak Maharaj (loud and prolonged cheers). I would ask this great assembly to listen to me in silence. I have come to make an appeal to your hearts and to your reason and I could not do so unless you were prepared to listen to whatever I have to say in absolute silence. I wish to offer my tribute to the departed patriot and I think that I cannot do better than say that his death, as his life, has poured new vigour into the country. If you were present as I was present at that great funeral procession, you would realise with me the meaning of my words. Mr. Tilak lived for his country. The inspiration of his life was freedom for his country which he called Swaraj the inspiration of his death-bed was also freedom for his country. And it was that which gave him such marvellous hold upon his countrymen; it was that which commanded the adoration not of a
U|| few chosen Indians belonging to the upper strata of society but of millions of his countrymen. His life was one long sustained piece of self-sacrifice. He began that life of discipline and self-sacrifice in 1879 and he continued that life up to the end of his day, and that was the secret of his hold upon his country. He not only knew what he wanted for his country but also how to live for his country and how to die for his country. I hope then that whatever I say this evening to this vast mass of people, will bear fruit in that same sacrifice for which the life of Lokamanya Tilak Maharaj stands. His life, if it teaches us anything whatsoever, teaches one supreme lesson: that if we want to do anything whatsoever for our country we can do so not by speeches, however grand, eloquent and convincing they may be, but only by sacrifice at the back of every act of our life. I have come to ask everyone of you whether you are ready and willing to give sufficiently for your country’s sake for country’s honour and 
U||for religion. I have boundless faith in you, the citizens of Madras, and the people of this great presidency, a faith which I began to cultivate in the year 1903 when I first made acquaintance with the Tamil labourers in South Africa; and I hope that in these hours of our trial, this province will not be second to any other in India, and that it will lead in this spirit of self-sacrifice and will translate every word into action.
U||NEED FOR NON-CO-OPERATION
U||What is this non-co-operation, about which you have heard so much, and why do we want to offer this non-co-operation? I wish to go for the time being into the why. Here are two things before this country: the first and the foremost is the Khilafat question. On this the heart of the Mussalmans of India has become lascerated. British pledges given after the greatest deliberation by the Prime Minister of England in the name of the English nation, have been dragged into the mire. The promises given to Moslem India on the strength of which, the consideration that was expected by the British nation was exacted, have been broken, and the great religion of Islam has been placed in danger. The Mussalmans hold—and I venture to think they rightly hold—that so long as British promises remain unfulfilled, so long is it impossible for them to tender whole-hearted fealty and loyalty to the British connection; and if it is to be a choice for a devout Mussalman between loyalty to the British connection and loyalty to his
U|| Code and Prophet, he will not require a second to make his choice,—and he has declared his choice. The Mussalmans say frankly openly and honourably to the whole world that if the British Ministers and the British nation do not fulfil the pledges given to them and do not wish to regard with respect the sentiments of 70 millions of the inhabitants of India who profess the faith of Islam, it will be impossible for them to retain Islamic loyalty. It is a question, then for the rest of the Indian population to consider whether they want to perform a neighbourly duty by their Mussalman countrymen, and if they do, they have an opportunity of a lifetime which will not occur for another hundred years, to show their good-will, fellowship and friendship and to prove what they have been saying for all these long years that the Mussalman is the brother of the Hindu. If the Hindu regards that before the connection with the British nation comes his natural connection with his Moslem brother, then I say to you that if yo
U||u find that the Moslem claim is just, that it is based upon real sentiment, and that at its back ground is this great religious feeling, you cannot do otherwise than help the Mussalman through and through, so long as their cause remains just, and the means for attaining the end remains equally just, honourable and free from harm to India. These are the plain conditions which the Indian Mussalmans have accepted; and it was when they saw that they could accept the proferred aid of the Hindus, that they could always justify the cause and the means before the whole world, that they decided to accept the proferred hand of fellowship. It is then for the Hindus and Mahomedans to offer a united front to the whole of the Christian powers of Europe and tell them that weak as India is, India has still got the capacity of preserving her self-respect, she still knows how to die for her religion and for her self-respect.
U||That is the Khilafat in a nut-shell; but you have also got the Punjab. The Punjab has wounded the heart of India as no other question has for the past century. I do not exclude from my calculation the Mutiny of 1857. Whatever hardships India had to suffer during the Mutiny, the insult that was attempted to be offered to her during the passage of the Rowlatt legislation and that which was offered after its passage were unparalleled in Indian history. It is because you want justice from the British nation in connection with the Punjab atrocities: you have to devise, ways and means as to how you can get this justice. The House of Commons, the House of Lords, Mr. Montagu, the Viceroy of India, everyone of them know what the feeling of India is on this Khilafat question and on that of the Punjab; the debates in both the Houses of Parliament, the action of Mr. Montagu and that of the Viceroy have demonstrated to you completely that they are not willing to give the justice which is India’s due and which she deman
U||ds. I suggest that our leaders have got to find a way out of this great difficulty and unless we have made ourselves even with the British rulers in India and unless we have gained a measure of self-respect at the hands of the British rulers in India, no connection, and no friendly intercourse is possible between them and ourselves. I, therefore, venture to suggest this beautiful and unanswerable method of non-co-operation.
U||IS IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL?
U||I have been told that non-co-operation is unconstitutional. I venture to deny that it is unconstitutional. On the contrary, I hold that non-co-operation is a just and religious doctrine; it is the inherent right of every human being and it is perfectly constitutional. A great lover of the British Empire has said that under the British constitution even a successful rebellion is perfectly constitutional and he quotes historical instances, which I cannot deny, in support of his claim. I do not claim any constitutionality for a rebellion successful or otherwise, so long as that rebellion means in the ordinary sense of the term, what it does mean namely wresting justice by violent means. On the contrary, I have said it repeatedly to my countrymen that violence whatever end it may serve in Europe, will never serve us in India. My brother and friend Shaukat Ali believes in methods of violence; and if it was in his power to draw the sword against the British Empire, I know that he has got the courage of a man and h
U||e has got also the wisdom to see that he should offer that battle to the British Empire. But because he recognises as a true soldier that means of violence are not open to India, he sides with me accepting my humble assistance and pledges his word that so long as I am with him and so long as he believes in the doctrine, so long will he not harbour even the idea of violence against any single Englishman or any single man on earth. I am here to tell you that he has been as true as his word and has kept it religiously. I am here to bear witness that he has been following out this plan of non-violent Non-co-operation to the very letter and I am asking India to follow this non-violent non-co-operation. I tell you that there is not a better soldier living in our ranks in British India than Shaukat Ali. When the time for the drawing of the sword comes, if it ever comes, you will find him drawing that sword and you will find me retiring to the jungles of Hindustan. As soon as India accepts the doctrine of the sword,
U|| my life as an Indian is finished. It is because I believe in a mission special to India and it is because I believe that the ancients of India after centuries of experience have found out that the true thing for any human being on earth is not justice based on violence but justice based on sacrifice of self, justice based on Yagna and Kurbani,—I cling to that doctrine and I shall cling to it for ever,—it is for that reason I tell you that whilst my friend believes also in the doctrine of violence and has adopted the doctrine of non-violence as a weapon of the weak, I believe in the doctrine of non-violence as a weapon of the strongest. I believe that a man is the strongest soldier for daring to die unarmed with his breast bare before the enemy. So much for the non-violent part of non-co-operation. I therefore, venture to suggest to my learned countrymen that so long as the doctrine of non-co-operation remains non-violent, so long there is nothing unconstitutional in that doctrine.
U||I ask further, is it unconstitutional for me to say to the British Government ‘I refuse to serve you?’ Is it unconstitutional for our worthy Chairman to return with every respect all the titles that he has ever held from the Government? Is it unconstitutional for any parent to withdraw his children from a Government or aided school? Is it unconstitutional for a lawyer to say ‘I shall no longer support the arm of the law so long as that arm of law is used not to raise me but to debase me’? Is it unconstitutional for a civil servant or for a judge to say, ‘I refuse to serve a Government which does not wish to respect the wishes of the whole people?’ I ask, is it unconstitutional for a policeman or for a soldier to tender his resignation when he knows that he is called to serve a Government which traduces his own countrymen? Is it unconstitutional for me to go to the ‘krishan,’ to the agriculturist, and say to him ‘it is not wise for you to pay any taxes if these taxes are used by the Governme
U||nt not to raise you but to weaken you?’ I hold and I venture to submit, that there is nothing unconstitutional in it. What is more, I have done every one of these things in my life and nobody has questioned the constitutional character of it. I was in Kaira working in the midst of 7 lakhs of agriculturists. They had all suspended the payment of taxes and the whole of India was at one with me. Nobody considered that it was unconstitutional. I submit that in the whole plan of non-co-operation, there is nothing unconstitutional. But I do venture to suggest that it will be highly unconstitutional in the midst of this unconstitutional Government,—in the midst of a nation which has built up its magnificent constitution,—for the people of India to become weak and to crawl on their belly—it will be highly unconstitutional for the people of India to pocket every insult that is offered to them; it is highly unconstitutional for the 70 millions of Mohamedans of India to submit to a violent wrong done to their r
U||eligion; it is highly unconstitutional for the whole of India to sit still and co-operate with an unjust Government which has trodden under its feet the honour of the Punjab. I say to my countrymen so long as you have a sense of honour and so long as you wish to remain the descendants and defenders of the noble traditions that have been handed to you for generations after generations, it is unconstitutional for you not to non-co-operate and unconstitutional for you to co-operate with a Government which has become so unjust as our Government has become. I am not anti-English; I am not anti-British; I am not anti any Government; but I am anti-untruth—anti-humbug and anti-injustice. So long as the Government spells injustice, it may regard me as its enemy, implacable enemy. I had hoped at the Congress at Amritsar—I am speaking God’s truth before you—when I pleaded on bended knees before some of you for co-operation with the Government. I had full hope that the British ministers who are wise, as a rule, 
U||would placate the Mussalman sentiment that they would do full justice in the matter of the Punjab atrocities; and therefore, I said:—let us return good-will to the hand of fellowship that has been extended to us, which I then believed was extended to us through the Royal Proclamation. It was on that account that I pleaded for co-operation. But to-day that faith having gone and obliterated by the acts of the British ministers, I am here to plead not for futile obstruction in the Legislative council but for real substantial non-co-operation which would paralyse the mightiest Government on earth. That is what I stand for to-day. Until we have wrung justice, and until we have wrung our self-respect from unwilling hands and from unwilling pens there can be no co-operation. Our Shastras say and I say so with the greatest deference to all the greatest religious preceptors of India but without fear of contradiction, that our Shastras teach us that there shall be no co-operation between injustice and justice, betwe
U||en an unjust man and a justice-loving man, between truth and untruth. Co-operation is a duty only so long as Government protects your honour, and non-co-operation is an equal duty when the Government instead of protecting robs you of your honour. That is the doctrine of non-co-operation.
U||NON-CO-OPERATION AND THE SPECIAL CONGRESS
U||I have been told that I should have waited for the declaration of the special Congress which is the mouth piece of the whole nation. I know that it is the mouthpiece of the whole nation. If it was for me, individual Gandhi, to wait, I would have waited for eternity. But I had in my hands a sacred trust. I was advising my Mussalman countrymen and for the time being I hold their honour in my hands. I dare not ask them to wait for any verdict but the verdict of their own Conscience. Do you suppose that Mussalmans can eat their own words, can withdraw from the honourable position they have taken up? If perchance—and God forbid that it should happen—the Special Congress decides against them, I would still advise my countrymen the Mussalmans to stand single handed and fight rather than yield to the attempted dishonour to their religion. It is therefore given to the Mussalmans to go to the Congress on bended knees and plead for support. But support or no support, it was not possible for them to wait for the Con
U||gress to give them the lead. They had to choose between futile violence, drawing of the naked sword and peaceful non-violent but effective non-co-operation, and they have made their choice. I venture further to say to you that if there is any body of men who feel as I do, the sacred character of non-co-operation, it is for you and me not to wait for the Congress but to act and to make it impossible for the Congress to give any other verdict. After all what is the Congress? The Congress is the collected voice of individuals who form it, and if the individuals go to the Congress with a united voice, that will be the verdict you will gain from the Congress. But if we go to the Congress with no opinion because we have none or because we are afraid to express it, then naturally we wait the verdict of the Congress. To those who are unable to make up their mind I say by all means wait. But for those who have seen the clear light as they see the lights in front of them, for them to wait is a sin. The Congress does n
U||ot expect you to wait but it expects you to act so that the Congress can gauge properly the national feeling. So much for the Congress.
U||BOYCOTT OF THE COUNCILS
U||Among the details of non-co-operation I have placed in the foremost rank the boycott of the councils. Friends have quarrelled with me for the use of the word boycott, because I have disapproved—as I disapprove even now—boycott of British goods or any goods for that matter. But there, boycott has its own meaning and here boycott has its own meaning. I not only do not disapprove but approve of the boycott of the councils that are going to be formed next year. And why do I do it? The people—the masses,—require from us, the leaders, a clear lead. They do not want any equivocation from us. The suggestion that we should seek election and then refuse to take the oath of allegiance, would only make the nation distrust the leaders. It is not a clear lead to the nation. So I say to you, my countrymen, not to fall into this trap. We shall sell our country by adopting the method of seeking election and then not taking the oath of allegiance. We may find it difficult, and I frankly confess to you that I have not 
U||that trust in so many Indians making that declaration and standing by it. To-day I suggest to those who honestly hold the view—viz. that we should seek election and then refuse to take the oath of allegiance—I suggest to them that they will fall into a trap which they are preparing for themselves and for the nation. That is my view. I hold that if we want to give the nation the clearest possible lead, and if we want not to play with this great nation we must make it clear to this nation that we cannot take any favours, no matter how great they may be so long as those favours are accompanied by an injustice a double wrong, done to India not yet redressed. The first indispensable thing before we can receive any favours from them is that they should redress this double wrong. There is a Greek proverb which used to say “Beware of the Greek but especially beware of them when they bring gifts to you.” To-day from those ministers who are bent upon perpetuating the wrong to Islam and to the Punjab, I say we 
U||cannot accept gifts but we should be doubly careful lest we may not fall into the trap that they may have devised. I therefore suggest that we must not coquet with the council and must not have anything whatsoever to do with them. I am told that if we, who represent the national sentiment do not seek election, the Moderates who do not represent that sentiment will. I do not agree. I do not know what the Moderates represent and I do not know what the Nationalists represent. I know that there are good sheep and black sheep amongst the Moderates. I know that there are good sheep and black sheep amongst the Nationalists. I know that many Moderates hold honestly the view that it is a sin to resort to non-co-operation. I respectfully agree to differ from them. I do say to them also that they will fall into a trap which they will have devised if they seek election. But that does not affect my situation. If I feel in my heart of hearts that I ought not to go to the councils I ought at least to abide by this decision
U|| and it does not matter if ninety-nine other countrymen seek election. That is the only way in which public work can be done, and public opinion can be built. That is the only way in which reforms can be achieved and religion can be conserved. If it is a question of religious honour, whether I am one or among many I must stand upon my doctrine. Even if I should die in the attempt, it is worth dying for, than that I should live and deny my own doctrine. I suggest that it will be wrong on the part of any one to seek election to these Councils. If once we feel that we cannot co-operate with this Government, we have to commence from the top. We are the natural leaders of the people and we have acquired the right and the power to go to the nation and speak to it with the voice of non-co-operation. I therefore do suggest that it is inconsistent with non-co-operation to seek election to the Councils on any terms whatsoever.
U||LAWYERS AND NON-CO-OPERATION
U||I have suggested another difficult matter, viz., that the lawyers should suspend their practice. How should I do otherwise knowing so well how the Government had always been able to retain this power through the instrumentality of lawyers. It is perfectly true that it is the lawyers of to-day who are leading us, who are fighting the country’s battles, but when it comes to a matter of action against the Government, when it comes to a matter of paralysing the activity of the Government I know that the Government always look to the lawyers, however fine fighters they may have been to preserve their dignity and their self-respect. I therefore suggest to my lawyer friends that it is their duty to suspend their practice and to show to the Government that they will no longer retain their offices, because lawyers are considered to be honorary officers of the courts and therefore subject to their disciplinary jurisdiction. They must no longer retain these honorary offices if they want to withdraw on operation from 
U||Government. But what will happen to law and order? We shall evolve law and order through the instrumentality of these very lawyers. We shall promote arbitration courts and dispense justice, pure, simple home-made justice, swadeshi justice to our countrymen. That is what suspension of practice means.
U||PARENTS AND NON-CO-OPERATION
U||I have suggested yet another difficulty—to withdraw our children from the Government schools and to ask collegiate students to withdraw from the College and to empty Government aided schools. How could I do otherwise? I want to gauge the national sentiment. I want to know whether the Mahomodans feel deeply. If they feel deeply they will understand in the twinkling of an eye, that it is not right for them to receive schooling from a Government in which they have lost all faith; and which they do not trust at all. How can I, if I do not want to help this Government, receive any help from that Government. I think that the schools and colleges are factories for making clerks and Government servants. I would not help this great factory for manufacturing clerks and servants if I want to withdraw co-operation from that Government. Look at it from any point of view you like. It is not possible for you to send your children to the schools and still believe in the doctrine of non-co-operation.
U||THE DUTY OF TITLE HOLDERS
U||I have gone further. I have suggested that our title holders should give up their titles. How can they hold on to the titles and honour bestowed by the Government? They were at one time badges of honours when we believed that national honour was safe in their hands. But now they are no longer badges of honour but badges of dishonour and disgrace when we really believe that we cannot get justice from this Government. Every title holder holds his titles and honours as trustee for the nation and in this first step in the withdrawal of co-operation from the Government they should surrender their titles without a moment’s consideration. I suggest to my Mahomedan countrymen that if they fail in this primary duty they will certainly fail in non-co-operation unless the masses themselves reject the classes and take up non-co-operation in their own hands and are able to fight that battle even as the men of the French Revolution were able to take the reins of Government in their own hands leaving aside the leaders an
U||d marched to the banner of victory. I want no revolution. I want ordered progress. I want no disordered order. I want no chaos. I want real order to be evolved out of this chaos which is misrepresented to me as order. If it is order established by a tyrant in order to get hold of the tyrannical reins of Government I say that it is no order for me but it is disorder. I want to evolve justice out of this injustice. Therefore, I suggest to you the passive non-co-operation. If we would only realise the secret of this peaceful and infallible doctrine you will know and you will find that you will not want to use even an angry word when they lift the sword at you and you will not want even to lift your little finger, let alone a stick or a sword.
U||NON-CO-OPERATION—SERVICE TO THE EMPIRE
U||You may consider that I have spoken these words in anger because I have considered the ways of this Government immoral, unjust, debasing and untruthful. I use these adjectives with the greatest deliberation. I have used them for my own true brother with whom I was engaged in battle of non-co-operation for full 13 years and although the ashes cover the remains of my brother I tell you that I used to tell him that he was unjust when his plans were based upon immoral foundation. I used to tell him that he did not stand for truth. There was no anger in me, I told him this home truth because I loved him. In the same manner, I tell the British people that I love them, and that I want their association but I want that association on conditions well defined. I want my self-respect and I want my absolute equality with them. If I cannot gain that equality from the British people, I do not want that British connection. If I have to let the British people go and import temporary disorder and dislocation of national busi
U||ness, I will favour that disorder and dislocation than that I should have injustice from the hands of a great nation such as the British nation. You will find that by the time the whole chapter is closed that the successors of Mr. Montagu will give me the credit for having rendered the most distinguished service that I have yet rendered to the Empire, in having offered this non-co-operation and in having suggest the boycott, not of His Royal Highness the principle of Wales, but of boycott of a visit engineered by Government in order to tighten its hold on the national neck. I will not allow it even if I stand alone, if I cannot persuade this nation not to welcome that visit but will boycott that visit with all the power at my command. It is for that reason I stand before you and implore you to offer this religious battle, but it is not a battle offered to you by a visionary or a saint. I deny being a visionary. I do not accept the claim of saintliness. I am of the earth, earthy, a common gardener man as much
U|| as any one of you, probably much more than you are. I am prone to as many weaknesses as you are. But I have seen the world. I have lived in the world with my eyes open. I have gone through the most fiery ordeals that have fallen to the lot of man. I have gone through this discipline. I have understood the secret of my own sacred Hinduism. I have learnt the lesson that non-co-operation is the duty not merely of the saint but it is the duty of every ordinary citizen, who not know much, not caring to know much but wants to perform his ordinary household functions. The people of Europe touch even their masses, the poor people the doctrine of the sword. But the Rishis of India, those who have held the tradition of India have preached to the masses of India this doctrine, not of the sword, not of violence but of suffering, of self-suffering. And unless you and I am prepared to go through this primary lesson we are not ready even to offer the sword and that is the lesson my brother Shaukal Ali has imbibed to teach
U|| and that is why he to-day accepts my advice tendered to him in all prayerfulness and in all humility and says ‘long live non-co-operation.’ Please remember that even in England the little children were withdrawn from the schools; and colleges in Cambridge and Oxford were closed. Lawyers had left their desks and were fighting in the trenches. I do not present to you the trenches but I do ask you to go through the sacrifice that the men, women and the brave lads of England went through. Remember that you are offering battle to a nation which is saturated with their spirit of sacrifice whenever the occasion arises. Remember that the little band of Boers offered stubborn resistance to a mighty nation. But their lawyers had left their desks. Their mothers had withdrawn their children from the schools and colleges and the children had become the volunteers of the nation, I have seen them with these naked eyes of mine. I am asking my countrymen in India to follow no other gospel than the gospel of self-sacrifi
U||ce which precedes every battle. Whether you belong to the school of violence or non-violence you will still have to go through the fire of sacrifice, and of discipline. May God grant you, may God grant our leaders the wisdom, the courage and the true knowledge to lead the nation to its cherished goal. May God grant the people of India the right path, the true vision and the ability and the courage to follow this path, difficult and yet easy, of sacrifice.
U||SPEECH AT TRICHINOPOLY
U||Mahatma Gandhi made the following speech at Trichinopoly on the 18th August 1920:—
U||I thank you on behalf of my brother Shaukat Ali and myself for the magnificent reception that the citizens of Trichinopoly have given to us. I thank you also for the many addresses that you have been good enough to present to us, but I must come to business.
U||It is a great pleasure to me to renew your acquaintance for reasons that I need not give you. I expect great things from Trichinopoly, Madura and a few places I could name. I take it that you have read my address on the Madras Beach on non-co-operation. Without taking up your time in this great assembly, I wish to deal with one or two matters that arise out of Mr. S. Kasturiranga Iyongar’s speech. He says in effect that I should have waited for the Congress mandate on Non-co-operation. That was impossible, because the Mussulmans had and still have a duty, irrespective of the Hindus, to perform in reference to their own religion. It was impossible for them to wait for any mandate save the mandate of their own religion in a matter that vitally concerned the honour of Islam. It is therefore possible for them only to go to the Congress on bended knees with a clear cut programme of their own and ask the Congress to pronounce its blessings upon that programme and if they are not so fortunate as to secure the ble
U||ssings of the National Assembly without meaning any disrespect to that assembly, it is their bounden duty to go on with their programme, and so it is the duty of every Hindu who considers his Mussalman brother as a brother who has a just cause which he wishes to vindicate, to throw in his lot with his Mussalman brother. Our leader does not quarrel with the principle of non-co-operation by itself, but he objects to the three principal details of non-co-operation.
U||COUNCIL ELECTIONS
U||He considers that it is our duty to seek election to the Councils and fight our battle on the floor of the Council hall. I do not deny the possibility of a fight and a royal fight on the Council floor. We have done it for the last 35 years, but I venture to suggest to you and to him, with all due respect, that it is not non-co-operation and it is not half as successful as non-co-operation can be. You cannot go to a class of people with a view to convince them by any fight—call it even obstruction—who have got a settled conviction and a settled policy to follow. It is in medical language an incompatible mixture out of which you can gain nothing, but if you totally boycott the Council, you create a public opinion in the country with reference to the Khilafat wrong and the Punjab wrong which will become totally irresistible. The first advantage of going to the Councils must be good-will on the part of the rulers. It is absolutely lacking. In the place of good-will you have got nothing but injustice but I mu
U||st move on.
U||LAWYERS’ PRACTICE
U||I come now to the second objection of Mr. Kasturiranga Iyengar with reference to the suspension by lawyers of their practice. Milk is good in itself but it comes absolutely poisonous immediately a little bit of arsenic is added to it. Law courts are similarly good when justice is distilled through them on behalf of a Sovereign power which wants to do justice to its people. Law courts are one of the greatest symbols of power and in the battle of non-co-operation, you may not leave law courts untouched and claim to offer non-co-operation, but if you will read that objection carefully, you will find in that objection the great fear that the lawyers will not respond to the call that the country makes upon them, and it is just there that the beauty of non-co-operation comes in. If one lawyer alone suspends practice, it is so much to the good of the country and so if we are sure to deprive the Government of the power that it possess through its law courts, whether one lawyer takes it up or many, we must adopt that
U|| step.
U||GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS
U||He objects also to the plan of boycotting Government schools. I can only say what I have said with reference to lawyers that if we mean non-co-operation, we may not receive any favours from the Government, no matter how advantageous by themselves they may be. In a great struggle like this, it is not open to us to count how many schools will respond and how many parents will respond and just as a geometrical problem is difficult, because it does not admit of easy proof, so also because a certain stage in national evolution is difficult, you may not avoid that step without making the whole of the evolution a farce.
U||We have had a great lesson in non-co-operation and co-operation. We had a lesson in non-co-operation when some young men began to fight there and it is a dangerous weapon. I have not the slightest doubt about it. One man with a determined will to non-co-operate can disturb a whole meeting and we had a physical demonstration of it to night but ours is non-violent, non-co-operation in which there can be no mistake whatsoever in the fundamental conditions are observed. If non-co-operation fails, it will not be for want of any inherent strength in it, but it will fall because there is no response to it, or because people have not sufficiently grasped its simple principles. You had also a practical demonstration of co-operation just now; that heavy chair went over the heads of so many people, because all wanted to lift their little hand to move that chair away from them and so was that heavier dome also removed from our sight by co-operation of man, woman and child. Everybody believes and knows that this Governme
U||nt of our exists only by the co-operation of the people and not by the force of arms it can wield and everyman with a sense of logic will tell you that the converse of that also is equally true that Government cannot stand if this co-operation on which it exists is withdrawn. Difficulties undoubtedly there are, we have hitherto learned how to sacrifice our voice and make speeches. We must also learn to sacrifice ease, money, comfort and that, we may learn form the Englishmen themselves. Every one who has studied English history knows that we are now engaged in a battle with a nation which is capable of great sacrifice and the three hundred millions of India cannot make their mark upon the world, or gain their self-respect without an adequate measure of sacrifice.
U||BOYCOTT OF BRITISH GOODS
U||Our friend has suggested the boycott of British or foreign goods. Boycott of all foreign goods is another name for Swadeshi. He thinks that there will be a greater response in the boycott of all foreign goods. With the experience of years behind me and with an intimate knowledge of the mercantile classes, I venture to tell you that boycott of foreign goods, or boycott of merely British goods is more impracticable than any of the stops I have suggested. Whereas in all the steps that I have ventured to suggest there is practically no sacrifice of money involved, in the boycott of British or foreign goods you are inviting your merchant princes to sacrifice their millions. It has got to be done, but it is an exceedingly low process. The same may be said of the steps that I have ventured to suggest, I know, but boycott of goods in conceived as a punishment and the punishment is only effective when it is inflicted. What I have ventured to suggest is not a punishment, but the performance of a sacred duty, a measure
U|| of self-denial from ourselves, and therefore it is effective from its very inception when it is undertaken even by one man and a substantial duty performed even by one single man lays the foundation of nations liberty.
U||CONCLUSION
U||I am most anxious for my nation, for my Mussalman brethren also, to understand that if they want to vindicate national honour or the honour of Islam, it will be vindicated without a shadow of doubt, not be conceiving a punishment or a series of punishments, but by an adequate measure of self-sacrifice. I wish to speak of all our leaders in terms of the greatest respect, but whatever respect we wish to pay them may not stop or arrest the progress of the country, and I am most anxious that the country at this very critical period of its history should make its choice. The choice clearly does not lie before you and me in wresting by force of arms the sceptre form the British nation, but the choice lies in suffering this double wrong of the Khilafat and the Punjab, in pocketing humiliation and in accepting national emasculation or vindication of India’s honour by sacrifice to-day by every man, woman and child and those who feel convinced of the rightness of things, we should make that choice to-night. So, citi
U||zens of Trichinopoly, you may not wait for the whole of India but you can enforce the first step of non-co-operation and begin your operations even from to-morrow, if you have not done so already. You can surrender all your titles to-morrow all the lawyers may surrender their practice to-morrow; those who cannot sustain body and soul by any other means can be easily supported by the Khilafat Committee, if they will give their whole time and attention to the work of that Committee and if the layers will kindly do that, you will find that there is no difficulty in settling your disputes by private arbitration. You can nationalise your schools from to-morrow if you have got the will and the determination. It is difficult, I know, when only a few of you think these things. It is as easy as we are sitting here when the whole of this vast audience is of one mind and as it was easy for you to carry that chair so is it easy for you to enforce this programme from to-morrow if you have one will, one determination and 
U||love for your country, love for the honour of your country and religion. (Loud and prolonged cheers.)
U||SPEECH AT CALICUT
U||Mr. Chairman and friends.—On behalf of my brother Shaukut Ali and myself I wish to thank you most sincerely for the warm welcome you have extended to us. Before I begin to explain the purpose of our mission I have to give you the information that Pir Mahboob Shah who was being tried in Sindh for sedition has been sentenced to two years’ simple imprisonment. I do not know exactly what the offence was with which the Pir was charged. I do not know whether the words attributed to him were ever spoken by him. But I do know that the Pirsaheb declined to offer any defence and with perfect resignation he has accepted his penalty. For me it is a matter of sincere pleasure that the Pirsaheb who exercises great influence over his followers has understood the spirit of the struggle upon which we have embarked. It is not by resisting the authority of Government that we expect to succeed in the great task before us. But I do expect that we shall succeed if we understand the spirit of non-co-operation. The Lieutenant-G
U||overnor of Burma himself has told us that the British retain their hold on India not by the force of arms but by the force of co-operation of the people. Thus he has given us the remedy for any wrong that the Government may do to the people, whether knowingly or unknowingly. And so long as we co-operate with the Government, so long as we support that Government, we become to that extent sharers in the wrong. I admit that in ordinary circumstances a wise subject will tolerate the wrongs of a Government, but a wise subject never tolerates a wrong that a Government imposes on the declared will of a people. And I venture to submit to this great meeting that the Government of India and the Imperial Government have done a double wrong to India, and if we are a nation of self-respecting people conscious of its dignity, conscious of its right, it is not just and proper that we should stand the double humiliation that the Government has heaped upon us. By shaping and by becoming a predominant partner in the peace ter
U||ms imposed on the helpless Sultan of Turkey, the Imperial Government have intentionally flouted the cherished sentiment of the Mussalman subjects of the Empire. The present Prime Minister gave a deliberate pledge after consultation with his colleagues when it was necessary for him to conciliate the Mussalmans of India. I claim to have studied this Khilafat question in a special manner. I claim to understand the Mussalman feeling on the Khilafat question and I am here to declare for the tenth time that on the Khilafat matter the Government has wounded the Mussalman sentiment as they had never done before. And I say without fear of contradiction that if the Mussalmans of India had not exercised great self-restraint and if there was not the gospel of non-co-operation preached to them and if they had not accepted it, there would have been bloodshed in India by this time. I am free to confess that spilling of blood would not have availed their cause. But a man who is in a state of rage whose heart has become lace
U||rated does not count the cost of his action. So much for the Khilafat wrong.
U||I propose to take you for a minute to the Punjab, the northern end of India. And what have both Governments done for the Punjab? I am free to confess again that the crowds in Amritsar went mad for a moment. They were goaded to madness by a wicked administration. But no madness on the part of a people can justify the shedding of innocent blood, and what have they paid for it? I venture to submit that no civilised Government could ever have made the people pay the penalty and retribution that they have paid. Innocent men were tried through mock-tribunals and imprisoned for life. Amnesty granted to them after; I count of no consequence. Innocent, unarmed men, who knew nothing of what was to happen, were butchered in cold blood without the slightest notice. Modesty of women in Manianwalla, women who had done no wrong to any individual, was outraged by insolent officers. I want you to understand what I mean by outrage of their modesty. Their veils were opened with his stick by an officer. Men who were declared to
U|| be utterly innocent by the Hunter Committee were made to crawl on their bellies. And all these wrongs totally undeserved remain unavenged. If it was the duty of the Government of India to punish those who were guilty of incendiarism and murder, as I hold it was their duty, it was doubly their duty to punish officers who insulted and oppressed innocent people. But in the face of these official wrongs we have the debate in the house of lords supporting official terrorism, it is this double wrong, the affront to Islam and the injury to the manhood of the Punjab, that we feel bound to wipe out by non-co-operation. We have prayed, petitioned, agitated, we have passed resolutions. Mr. Mahomed Ali supported by his friends is now waiting on the British public. He has pleaded the cause of Islam in a most manful manner, but his pleading has fallen on deaf ears and we have his word for it that whilst France and Italy have shown great sympathy for the cause of Islam, it is the British Ministers who have shown no sympat
U||hy. This shows which way the British Ministers and the present holders of office in India mean to deal by the people. There is no goodwill, there is no desire to placate the people of India. The people of India must therefore have a remedy to redress the double wrong. The method of the west is violence. Wherever the people of the west have felt a wrong either justly or unjustly, they have rebelled and shed blood. As I have said in my letter to the Viceroy of India, half of India does not believe in the remedy of violence. The other half is too weak to offer it. But the whole of India is deeply hurt and stirred by this wrong, and it is for that reason that I have suggested to the people of India the remedy of non-co-operation. I consider it perfectly harmless, absolutely constitutional and yet perfectly efficacious. It is a remedy in which, if it is properly adopted, victory is certain, and it is the age-old remedy of self-sacrifice. Are the Mussalmans of India who feel the great wrong done to Islam ready to 
U||make an adequate self-sacrifice? All the scriptures of the world teach us that there can be no compromise between justice and injustice. Co-operation on the part of a justice-loving man with an unjust man is a crime. And if we desire to compel this great Government to the will of the people, as we must, we must adopt this great remedy of non-co-operation. And if the Mussalmans of India offer non-co-operation to Government in order to secure justice in the Khilafat matter, I believe it is duty of the Hindus to help them so long as their moans are just. I consider the eternal friendship between the Hindus and Mussalmans is more important than the British connection. I would prefer any day anarchy and chaos in India to an armed peace brought about by the bayonet between the Hindus and Mussalmans. I have therefore ventured to suggest to my Hindu brethren that if they wanted to live at peace with Mussalmans, there is an opportunity which is not going to recur for the next hundred years. And I venture to assure yo
U||u that if the Government of India and the Imperial Government come to know that there is a determination on the part of the people to redress this double wrong they would not hesitate to do what is needed. But in the Mussalmans of India will have to take the lead in the matter. You will have to commence the first stage of non-co-operation in right earnest. And if you may not help this Government, you may not receive help from it. Titles which were the other day titles of honour are to-day in my opinion badges of our disgrace. We must therefore surrender all titles of honour, all honorary offices. It will constitute an emphatic demonstration of the disapproval by the leaders of the people of the acts of the Government. Lawyers must suspend their practice and must resist the power of the Government which has chosen to flout public opinion. Nor may we receive instruction from schools controlled by Government and aided by it. Emptying of the schools will constitute a demonstration of the will of the middle class
U|| of India. It is far better for the nation even to neglect the literary instruction of the children than to co-operate with a Government that has striven to maintain an injustice and untruth on the Khilafat and Punjab matters. Similarly have I ventured to suggest a complete boycott of reformed councils. That will be an emphatic declaration of the part of the representatives of the people that they do not desire to associate with the Government so long as the two wrongs continue. We must equally decline to offer ourselves as recruits for the police or the military. It is impossible for us to go to Mesopotamia or to offer to police that country or to offer military assistance and to help the Government in that blood guiltiness. The last plank in the first stage is Swadeshi. Swadeshi is intended not so much to bring pressure upon the Government as to demonstrate the capacity for sacrifice on the part of the men and women of India. When one-fourth of India has its religion at stake and when the whole of India ha
U||s its honour at stake, we can be in no mood to bedeck ourselves with French calico or silks from Japan. We must resolve to be satisfied with cloth woven by the humble weavers of India in their own cottages out of yarn spun by their sisters in their own homes. When a hundred years ago our tastes were not debased and we were not lured by all the fineries from the foreign countries, we were satisfied with the cloth produced by the men and women in India, and if I could but in a moment revolutionize the tastes of India and make it return to its original simplicity, I assure you that the Gods would descent to rejoice at the great act of renunciation. That is the first stage in non-co-operation. I hope it is as easy for you as it is easy for me to see that if India is capable of taking the first step in anything like a full measure that step will bring the redress we want. I therefore do not intend to take you to the other stages of non-co-operation. I would like you to rivet your attention upon the plans in the f
U||irst stage. You will have noticed that but two things are necessary in going through the first stage: (1) Prefect spirit of non-violence is indispensable for non-co-operation, (2) only a little self-sacrifice, I pray to God that He will give the people of India sufficient courage and wisdom and patience to go through this experiment of non-co-operation. I think you for the great reception that you have given us. And I also thank you for the great patience and exemplary silence with which you have listened to my remarks.
U||August 1920.
U||SPEECH AT MANGALORE
U||Mr. Chairman and friends,—To my brother Shaukat Ali and me it was a pleasure to go through this beautiful garden of India. The great reception that you gave us this afternoon, and this great assembly are most welcome to us, if they are a demonstration of your sympathy with the cause which you have the honour to represent. I assure you that we have not undertaken this incessant travelling in order to have receptions and addresses, no matter how cordial they may be. But we have undertaken this travelling throughout the length and breadth of this dear Motherland to place before you the position that faces us to-day. It is our privilege, as it is our duty, to place that position before the country and let her make the choice.
U||Throughout our tour we have received many addresses, but in my humble opinion no address was more truly worded than the address that was presented to us at Kasargod. It addressed both of us as ‘dear revered brothers.’ I am unable to accept the second adjective ‘revered.’ The word ‘dear’ is dear to me I must confess. But dearer than that is the expression ‘brothers.’ The signatories to that address recognized the true significance of this travel. No blood brothers can possibly be more intimately related, can possibly be more united in one purpose, one aim than my brother Shaukat Ali and I. And I considered it a proud privilege and honour to be addressed as blood brother to Shaukat Ali. The contents of that address were as equally significant. It stated that in our united work was represented the essence of the unity between the Mussalmans and Hindus in India. If we two cannot represent that very desirable unity, if we two cannot cement the relation between the two communities, I do not know wh
U||o can. Then without any rhetoric and without any flowery language the address went on to describe the inwardness of the Punjab and the Khilafat struggle; and then in simple and beautiful language it described the spiritual significance of Satyagrah and Non-co-operation. This was followed by a frank and simple promise. Although the signatories to the address realised the momentous nature of the struggle on which we have embarked, and although they sympathise with the struggle with their whole heart, they wound up by saying that even if they could not follow non-co-operation in all its details, they would do as much as they could to help the struggle. And lastly, in eloquent, and true language, they said ‘if we cannot rise equal to the occasion it will not be due to want of effort but to want of ability.’ I can desire no better address, no better promise, and if you, the citizens of Mangalore, can come up to the level of the signatories, and give us just the assurance that you consider the struggle to be r
U||ight and that it commands your entire approval, I am certain you will make all sacrifice that lies in your power. For we are face to face with a peril greater than plagues, greater than influenza, greater than earthquakes and mighty floods, which sometimes overwhelm this land. These physical calamities can rob us of so many Indian bodies. But the calamity that has at the present moment overtaken India touches the religious honour of a fourth of her children and the self-respect of the whole nation. The Khilafat wrong affects the Mussalmans of India, and the Punjab calamity very nearly overwhelms the manhood of India. Shall we in the face of this danger be weak or rise to our full height. The remedy for both the wrongs is the spiritual solvent of non-co-operation. I call it a spiritual weapon, because it demands discipline and sacrifice from us. It demands sacrifice from every individual irrespective of the rest. And the promise that is behind this performance of duty, the promise given by every religion that
U|| I have studied is sure and certain. It is that there is no spotless sacrifice that has been yet offered on earth, which has not carried with it its absolute adequate reward. It is a spiritual weapon, because it waits for no mandate from anybody except one’s own conscience. It is a spiritual weapon, because it brings out the best in the nation and it absolutely satisfies individual honour if a single individual takes it, and it will satisfy national honour if the whole nation takes it up. And therefore it is that I have called non-co-operation in opposition to the opinion of many of my distinguished countrymen and leaders—a weapon that is infallible and absolutely practicable. It is infallible and practicable, because it satisfies the demands of individual conscience. God above cannot, will not expect Maulana Shaukat Ali to do more than he has been doing, for he has surrendered and placed at the disposal of God whom he believes to be the Almighty ruler of everyone, he has delivered all in the service of 
U||God. And we stand before the citizens of Mangalore and ask them to make their choice either to accept this precious gift that we lay at their feet or to reject it. And after having listened to my message if you come to the come to the conclusion that you have no other remedy than non-co-operation for the conservation of Islam and the honour of India, you will accept that remedy. I ask you not to be confused by so many bewildering issues that are placed before you, nor to be shaken from your purpose because you see divided counsels amongst your leaders. This is one of the necessary limitations of any spiritual or any other struggle that has ever been fought on this earth. It is because it comes so suddenly that it confuses the mind if the heart is not tuned properly. And we would be perfect human beings on this earth if in all of us was found absolutely perfect correspondence between the mind and the heart. But those of you who have been following the newspaper controversy, will find that no matter what divis
U||ion of opinion exists amongst our journals and leaders there is unanimity that the remedy is efficacious if it can be kept free from violence, and if it is adopted on a large scale. I admit the difficulty the virtue however lies in surmounting it. We cannot possibly combine violence with a spiritual weapon like non-co-operation. We do not offer spotless sacrifice if we take the lives of others in offering our own. Absolute freedom from violence is therefore it condition precedent to non-co-operation. But I have faith in my country to know that when it has assimilated the principle of the doctrine In the fullest extent, it will respond to it. And in no case will India make any headway whatsoever until she has learnt the lesson of self-sacrifice. Even if this country were to take up the doctrine of the sword, which God forbid, it will have to learn the lesson of self-sacrifice. The second difficulty suggested is the want of solidarity of the nation. I accept it too. But that difficulty I have already answered 
U||by saying that it is a remedy that can be taken up by individuals for individual and by the nation for national satisfaction; and therefore even if the whole nation does not take up non-co-operation, the individual successes, which may be obtained by individuals taking up non-co-operation will stand to their own credit as of the nation to which they belong.
U||The first stage in my humble opinion is incredibly easy inasmuch as it does not involve any very great sacrifice. If your Khan bahadurs and other title-holders were to renounce their titles I venture to submit that whilst the renunciation will stand to the credit and honour of the nation it will involve a little or no sacrifice. On the contrary, they will not only have surrendered no earthly riches but they will have gained the applause of the nation. Let us see what it means, this first step. The able editor of Hindu, Mr. Kastariranga Iyengar, and almost every journalist in the country are agreed that the renunciation of titles is a necessary and a desirable step. And if these chosen people of the Government were without exception to surrender their titles to Government giving notice that the heart of India is doubly wounded in that the honour of India and of muslim religion is at stake and that therefore they can no longer retain their titles, I venture to suggest, that this their step which costs not a si
U||ngle penny either to them or to the nation will be an effective demonstration of the national will.
U||Take the second step or the second item of non-co-operation. I know there is strong opposition to the boycott of councils. The opposition when you begin to analyse it means not that the step is faulty or that it is not likely to succeed, but it is due to the belief that the whole country will not respond to it and that the Moderates will steal into the councils. I ask the citizens of Mangalore to dispel that fear from your hearts. United the voters of Mangalore can make it impossible for either a moderate or an extremist or any other form of leader to enter the councils as your representative. This step involves no sacrifice of money, no sacrifice of honour but the gaining of prestige for the whole nation. And I venture to suggest to you that this one step alone if it is taken with any degree of unanimity even by the extremists can bring about the desired relief, but if all do not respond the individual need not be afraid. He at least will have laid the foundation for true self progress, let him have the com
U||fort that he at least has washed his hands clean of the guilt of the Government.
U||Then I come to the members of the profession which one time I used to carry on. I have ventured to ask the lawyers of India to suspend their practice and withdraw their support from a Government which no longer stands for justice, pure and unadulterated, for the nation. And the step is good for the individual lawyer who takes it and is good for the nation if all the lawyers take it.
U||And so for the Government and the Government aided schools, I must confess that I cannot reconcile my conscience to my children going to Government schools and to the programme of non-co-operation is intended to withdraw all support from Government, and to decline all help from it.
U||I will not tax your patience by taking you through the other items of non-co-operation important as they are. But I have ventured to place before you four very important and forcible steps any one of which if fully taken up contains in it possibilities of success. Swadeshi is preached as an item of non-co-operation, as a demonstration of the spirit of sacrifice, and it is an item which every man, woman and child can take up.
U||August 1920.
U||SPEECH AT BEZWADA
U||As I said this morning one essential condition for the progress of India is Hindu-Muslim Unity. I understand that there was a little bit of bickering between Hindus and Mussalmans to-day in Bezwada. My brother Maulana Shaukat Ali adjusted the dispute between the two communities and he illustrated in his own person the entire efficacy of one item in the first stage of Non-co-operation. He sat without any vakils appearing before him for either parties to arbitrate on the dispute between them. He required no postponement for the consideration of the question from time to time. His fees consisted in a broken lead pencil. That is what we should do, if all the lawyers suspended practice and set up arbitration for the settlement of private disputes. But why was there any quarrel at all? It is laughable in the extreme when you come to think of it. Because the Hindus seem to have played music whilst passing the mosque. I think it was improper for them to do so. Hindu Moslem Unity does not mean that Hindus should ceas
U||e to respect the prejudices and sentiments cherished by Mussalmans. And as this question of music has given rise to many a quarrel between the two communities it behoves the Hindus, if they want to cultivate true Hindu-Moslem Unity, to refrain from acts which they know injure the sentiments of their Mussalman brethren. We may not take undue advantage of the great spirit of toleration that is developing in Mussalmans and do things likely to irritate them. It is never a matter of principle for a Hindu procession to continue playing music before mosques. And now that we desire voluntarily to respect Mussalman sentiment, we should be doubly careful at a time when Hindus are offering assistance to Mussalmans in their troubles. That assistance should be given in all humility and without any arrogation of rights. To my Mussalman brethren I would say that it would become their dignity to restrain themselves and not feel irritated when any Hindu had done anything to irritate their religious sentiment. But in any even
U||t, you have today presented to you a remedy for the settlement of any such issue. We must settle our disputes by arbitration as was done this after-noon. You cannot always get a Moulana Shankat Ali, exercising unrivalled influence on the community. But we can always get people enough in our own villages, towns and districts who exercise influence over such villages and towns and command the confidence of both the communities. The offended party should consider it its duty to approach them and not to take the law in its own hands.
U||It gives me much pleasure to announce to you that, Mr. Kaleswar Rao has consented to refrain from standing for election to the new Legislative Councils. You will be also pleased to know that Mr. Gulam Nohiuddin has resigned his Honorary Magistrateship, I hope that both these patriots will not consider that they have done their last duty by their acts of renunciation, but I hope they will regard their acts as a prelude to acts of greater purpose and greater energy and I hope they will take in hand the work of educating the electorate in their districts regarding boycott of councils. I have said elsewhere that never for another century will India be faced with a conjunction of events that faces it to-day. The cloud that has descended upon Islam has solidified the Moslem world as nothing else could have. It has awakened the men and women of Mussulman India from their deep sleep. Inasmuch as a single Panjabi was made to crawl on his belly in the famous street of Amitsar, I hold that the whole of was made to craw
U||l on its belly. And if we want to straighten up ourselves from that crawling position and stand erect before the whole world, it requires, a tremendous effort. H.E. the Viceroy in his Viceregal pronouncement at the opening of the Council was pleased to say that he did not desire to make any remarks on the Punjab events. He treated them as a closed chapter and referred us to the future verdict of history. I venture to tell you the citizens of Bezwada that India will have deserved to crawl in that lane if she accepts this pronouncement as the final answer, and if we want to stand erect before the whole world, it is impossible for a single child, man or woman in India to rest until fullest reparation has been done for the Punjab wrong. Similarly with reference to the Khilafat grievance the Mussalmans of India in my humble opinion will forfeit all title to consider themselves the followers of the great Prophet in whose name they recite the Kalama, day in and day out, they will forfeit their title if they do not 
U||put their shoulders to the wheel and lift this cloud that is hanging on them. But we shall make a serious blunder. India will commit suicide, if we do not understand and appreciate the forces that are arrayed against us. We have got to face a mighty Government with all its power ranged against us. This composed of men who are able, courageous, capable of making sacrifices. It is a Government which does not scruple to use means, fair or foul, in order to gain its end. No craft is above that Government. It resorts to frightfulness, terrorism. It resorts to bribery, in the shape of titles, honour and high offices. It administers opiates in the shape of Reforms. In essence then it is an autocracy double distilled in the guise of democracy. The greatest gift of a crafty cunning man are worthless so long as cunning resides in his heart. It is a Government representing a civilisation which is purely material and godless. I have given to you these qualities of this government in order not to excite your angry passio
U||ns, but in order that you may appreciate the forces that are matched against you. Anger will serve no purpose. We shall have to meet ungodliness by godliness. We shall have to meet their untruth by truth; we shall have to meet their cunning and their craft by openness and simplicity; we shall have to meet their terrorism and frightfulness by bravery. And it is an unbending bravery which is demanded of every man, woman and child. We must meet their organisation by greater organising ability. We must meet their discipline by grater discipline, and we must meet their sacrifices by infinitely greater sacrifices, and if we are in a position to show these qualities in a full measure I have not the slightest doubt that we shall win this battle. If really we have fear of God in us, our prayers will give us the strength to secure victory. God has always come to the help of the helpless and we need not go before any earthly power for help.
U||You heard this morning of the bravery of the sword, and the bravery of suffering. For me personally I have forever rejected the bravery of the sword. But, to-day it is not my purpose to demonstrate to you the final ineffectiveness of the sword. But he who runs may see that before India possesses itself a sword which will be more than a match for the forces of Europe, it will he generations. India may resort to the destruction of life and property here and there but such destructive cases serve no purpose. I have therefore presented to you a weapon called the bravery of suffering, otherwise called Non-co-operation. It is a bravery which is open to the weakest among the weak. It is open to women and children. The power of suffering is the prerogative of nobody, and if only 300 millions of Indians could show the power of suffering in order to redress a grievous wrong done to the nation or to its religion, I make bold to say that, India will never require to draw the sword. And unless we are able to show an adeq
U||uate measure of sacrifice we shall lose this battle. No one need tell me that India has not got this power of suffering. Every father and mother is witness to what i am about to say, viz., that every father and mother have shown in the domestic affairs matchless power of suffering. And if we have only developed national consciousness, if we have developed sufficient regard for our religion, we shall have developed power of suffering in the national and religious field. Considered in these terms the first stage in Non-co-operation is the simplest and the easiest state. If the title-holders of India consider that India is suffering from a grievous wrong both as regards the Punjab and the Khilafat is it any suffering on their part to renounce their titles to-day? What is the measure of the suffering awaiting the lawyers who are called upon to suspend practice when compared to the great benefit which is in store for the nation? And if thy parents of India will summon up courage to sacrifice secular education, th
U||ey will have given their children the real education of a life-time. For they will have learnt the value of religion and national honour. And I ask you, the citizens of Bezwada, to think well before you accept the loaves and fishes in the form of Government offices set them on one side and set national honour on the other and make your service. What sacrifice is there involved in the individual renouncing his candidature for legislative councils. The councils are a tempting bait. All kinds of arguments are being advanced in favour of joining the councils. India will sacrifice the opportunity of gaining her liberty if she touches them. It passes comprehension how we, who have known this Government, who have read the Viceregal pronouncement, how we who have known their determination not to give justice in the Punjab and the Khilafat matters, can gain any benefit by co-operation, constructive or obstructive, with this Government? But the Nationalists, belonging to a great popular party, tell us that if they do 
U||not contest these scats, the moderates will get in. Surely, it is nothing but an exhibition of want of courage and faith in our own cause to feel that we must enter the councils lest moderates should get in. Moderates believe in the possibility of obtaining justice at the hands of the Government. Nationalists have on the other hand filled the platforms with denunciations of the Government and its measures. How can the Nationalists ever hope to gain anything by entering the councils, holding the belief that they do? They will better represent the popular will if they wring justice from the Government by means of Non-co-operation. A calculating spirit at the present moment in the history of India will prove its ruin. I, therefore, tender my hearty congratulation to those who have announced their resignations of candidature or honorary offices, and I hope that their example will prove infectious. I have been told, and I believe it myself from what I have seen, that the Andhrus are a brave, courageous and spirit
U||ually-inclined people. I venture therefore to ask my Andhra brethren whether they have understood the spirituality of this beautiful doctrine of Non-co-operation. If they have, I hope they will not wait for a single moment for a mandate from the Congress or the Moslem League. They will understand that a spiritual weapon is god whether it is wielded by one or many. I, therefore, invite you to go to Calcutta with a united will and a united purpose, sanctified by a spirit of sacrifice, with a will of your own to convert those who are still undecided about the spirituality or the practicability of the weapon.
U||I thank you for the attention and patience with which you have listened to me. I pray to the Almighty that He may give you wisdom and courage that are so necessary at the present moment.—
U||August 1920.
U||THE CONGRESS
U||The largest and the most important Congress ever held has come and gone, It was the biggest demonstration ever held against the present system of Government. The President uttered the whole truth when he said that it was a Congress in which, instead of the President and the leaders driving the people, the people drove him and the latter. It was clear to every one on the platform that the people had taken the reins in their own hands. The platform would gladly have moved at a slower pace.
U||The Congress gave one day to a full discussion of the creed and voted solidly for it with but two dissentients after two nights’ sleep over the discussion. It gave one day to a discussion of non-co-operation resolution and voted for it with unparalleled enthusiasm. It gave the last day to listening to the whole of the remaining thirty-two Articles of the Constitution which were read and translated word for word by Maulana Mahomed Ali in a loud and clear voice. It showed that it was intelligently following the reading of it, for there was dissent when Article Eight was reached. It referred to non-interference by the Congress in the internal affairs of the Native States. The Congress would not have passed the proviso if it had meant that it could even voice the feelings of the people residing in the territories ruled by the princes. Happily it resolution suggesting the advisability of establishing Responsible Government in their territories enabled me to illustrate to the audience that the proviso did not pr
U||eclude the Congress from ventilating the grievances and aspirations of the subjects of these states, whilst it clearly prevented the Congress from taking any executive action in connection with them; as for instance holding a hostile demonstration in the Native States against any action of theirs. The Congress claims to dictate to the Government but it cannot do so by the very nature of its constitution in respect of the Native States.
U||Thus the Congress has taken three important steps after the greatest deliberation. It has expressed its determination in the clearest possible terms to attain complete null-government, if possible still in association with the British people, but even without, if necessary. It proposes to do so only by means that are honourable and non-violent. It has introduced fundamental changes in the constitution regulating its activities and has performed an act of self-denial in voluntarily restricting the number of delegates to one for every fifty thousand of the population of India and has insisted upon the delegates being the real representatives of those who want to take any part in the political life of the country. And with a view to ensuring the representation of all political parties it has accepted the principle of “single transferable vote.” It has reaffirmed the non-co-operation resolution of the Special Session and amplified it in every respect. It has emphasised the necessity of non-violence and laid 
U||down that the attainment of Swaraj is conditional upon the complete harmony between the component parts of India, and has therefore inculcated Hindu-Muslim unity. The Hindu delegates have called upon their leaders to settle disputes between Brahmins and non-Brahmins and have urged upon the religious heads the necessity of getting rid of the poison of untouchability. The Congress has told the parents of school-going children, and the lawyers that they have not responded sufficiently to the call of the nation and that they must make greater effort in doing so. It therefore follows that the lawyers who do not respond quickly to the call for suspension and the parents who persist in keeping their children in Government and aided institutions must find themselves dropping out from the public life of the country. The country calls upon every man and woman in India to do their full share. But of the details of the non-co-operation resolution I must write later.
U||WHO IS DISLOYAL?
U||Mr. Montagu has discovered a new definition of disloyalty. He considers my suggestion to boycott the visit of the Prince of Wales to be disloyal and some newspapers taking the cue from him have called persons who have made the suggestion ‘unmannerly’. They have even attributed to these ‘unmannerly’ persons the suggestion of boycotting the Prince. I draw a sharp and fundamental distinction between boycotting the Prince and boycotting any welcome arranged for him. Personally I would extend the heartiest welcome to His Royal Highness if he came or could come without official patronage and the protecting wings of the Government of the day. Being the heir to a constitutional monarch, the Prince’s movements are regulated and dictated by the ministers, no matter how much the dictation may be concealed beneath diplomatically polite language. In suggesting the boycott therefore the promoters have suggested boycott of an insolent bureaucracy and dishonest ministers of his Majesty.
U||You cannot have it both ways. It is true that under a constitutional monarchy, the royalty is above politics. But you cannot send the Prince on a political visit for the purpose of making political capital out of him, and then complain that those who will not play your game and in order to checkmate you, proclaim boycott of the Royal visit do not know constitutional usage. For the Prince’s visit is not for pleasure. His Royal Highness is to come in Mr. Lloyd George’s words, as the “ambassador of the British nation,” in other words, his own ambassador in order to issue a certificate of merit to him and possibly to give the ministers a new lease of life. The wish is designed to consolidate and strengthen a power that spells mischief for India. Even us it is, Mr. Montagu has foreseen, that the welcome will probably be excelled by any hitherto extended to Royalty, meaning that the people are not really and deeply affected and stirred by the official atrocities in the Punjab and the manifestly dishonest b
U||reach of official declarations on the Khilafat. With the knowledge that India was bleeding at heart, the Government of India should have told His Majesty’s ministers that the moment was inopportune for sending the Prince. I venture to submit that it is adding insult to injury to bring the Prince and through his visit to steal honours and further prestige for a Government that deserves to be dismissed with disgrace. I claim that I prove my loyalty by saying that India is in no mood, is too deeply in mourning, to take part in and to welcome His Royal Highness, and that the ministers and the Indian Government show their disloyalty by making the Prince a catspaw of their deep political game. If they persist, it is the clear duty of India to have nothing to do with the visit.
U||CRUSADE AGAINST NON-CO-OPERATION
U||I have most carefully read the manifesto addressed by Sir Narayan Chandavarkar and others dissuading the people from joining the non co-operation movement. I had expected to find some solid argument against non-co-operation, but to my great regret I have found in it nothing but distortion (no doubt unconscious) of the great religions and history. The manifesto says that ‘non-co-operation is deprecated by the religious tenets and traditions of our motherland, nay, of all the religions that have saved and elevated the human race.’ I venture to submit that the Bhagwad Gita is a gospel of non-co-operation between forces of darkness and those of light. If it is to be literally interpreted Arjun representing a just cause was enjoined to engage in bloody warfare with the unjust Kauravas. Tulsidas advises the Sant (the good) to shun the Asant (the evil-doers). The Zendavesta represents a perpetual dual between Ormuzd and Ahriman, between whom there is no compromise. To say of the Bible that it taboos non-co-oper
U||ation is not to know Jesus, a Prince among passive resisters, who uncompromisingly challenged the might of the Sadducees and the Pharisees and for the sake of truth did not hesitate to divide sons from their parents. And what did the Prophet of Islam do? He non-co-operated in Mecca in a most active manner so long as his life was not in danger and wiped the dust of Mecca off his feet when he found that he and his followers might have uselessly to perish, and fled to Medina and returned when he was strong enough to give battle to his opponents. The duty of non-co-operation with unjust men and kings is as strictly enjoined by all the religions as is the duty of co-operation with just men and kings. Indeed most of the scriptures of the world seem even to go beyond non-co-operation and prefer a violence to effeminate submission to a wrong. The Hindu religious tradition of which the manifesto speaks, clearly proves the duty of non-co-operation. Prahlad dissociated himself from his father, Meerabai from her husband
U||, Bibhishan from his brutal brother.
U||The manifesto speaking of the secular aspect says, ‘The history of nations affords no instance to show that it (meaning non-co-operation) has, when employed, succeeded and done good,’ One most recent instance of brilliant success of non-co-operation is that of General Botha who boycotted Lord Milner’s reformed councils and thereby procured a perfect constitution for his country. The Dukhobours of Russia offered non-co-operation, and a handful though they were, their grievances so deeply moved the civilized world that Canada offered them a home where they form a prosperous community. In India instances can be given by the dozen, in which in little principalities the raiyats when deeply grieved by their chiefs have cut off all connection with them and bent them to their will. I know of no instance in history where well-managed non-co-operation has failed.
U||Hitherto I have given historical instances of bloodless non-co-operation, I will not insult the intelligence of the reader by citing historical instances of non-co-operation combined with, violence, but I am free to confess that there are on record as many successes as failures in violent non-co-operation. And it is because I know this fact that I have placed before the country a non-violent scheme in which, if at all worked satisfactorily, success is a certainty and in which non-response means no harm. For if even one man non-co-operates, say, by resigning some office, he has gained, not lost. That is its ethical or religious aspect. For its political result naturally it requires polymerous support. I fear therefore no disastrous result from non-co-operation save for an outbreak of violence on the part of the people whether under provocation or otherwise. I would risk violence a thousand times than risk the emasculation of a whole race.
U||SPEECH AT MUZAFFARABAD
U||Before a crowded meeting of Mussalmans in the Muzaffarabad, Bombay, held on the 29th July 1920, speaking on the impending non-co-operation which commenced on the 1st of August, Mr. Gandhi said: The time for speeches on non-co-operation was past and the time for practice had arrived. But two things were needful for complete success. An environment free from any violence on the part of the people and a spirit of self-sacrifice. Non-co-operation, as the speaker had conceived it, was an impossibility in an atmosphere surcharged with the spirit of violence. Violence was an exhibition of anger and any such exhibition was dissipation of valuable energy. Subduing of one’s anger was a storing up of national energy, which, when set free in an ordered manner, would produce astounding results. His conception of non-co-operation did not involve rapine, plunder, incendiarism and all the concomitants of mass madness. His scheme presupposed ability on their part to control all the forces of evil. If, therefore, any disord
U||erliness was found on the part of the people which they could not control, he for one would certainly help the Government to control them. In the presence of disorder it would be for him a choice of evil, and evil through he considered the present Government to be, he would not hesitate for the time being to help the Government to control disorder. But he had faith in the people. He believed that they knew that the cause could only be won by non-violent methods. To put it at the lowest, the people had not the power, even if they had the will, to resist with brute strength the unjust Governments of Europe who had, in the intoxication of their success disregarding every canon of justice dealt so cruelly by the only Islamic Power in Europe.
U||In non-co-operation they had a matchless and powerful weapon. It was a sign of religious atrophy to sustain an unjust Government that supported an injustice by resorting to untruth and camouflage. So long therefore as the Government did not purge itself of the canker of injustice and untruth, it was their duty to withdraw all help from it consistently with their ability to preserve order in the social structure. The first stage of non-co-operation was therefore arranged so as to involve minimum of danger to public peace and minimum of sacrifice on the part of those who participated in the movement. And if they might not help an evil Government nor receive any favours from it, it followed that they must give up all titles of honour which were no longer a proud possession. Lawyers, who were in reality honorary officers of the Court, should cease to support Courts that uphold the prestige of an unjust Government and the people must be able to settle their disputes and quarrels by private arbitration. Similarly 
U||parents should withdraw their children from the public schools and they must evolve a system of national education or private education totally independent of the Government. An insolent Government conscious of its brute strength, might laugh at such withdrawals by the people especially as the Law courts and schools were supposed to help the people, but he had not a shadow of doubt that the moral effect of such a step could not possibly be lost even upon a Government whose conscience had become stifled by the intoxication of power.
U||He had hesitation in accepting Swadeshi as a plank in non-co-operation. To him Swadeshi was as dear as life itself. But he had no desire to smuggle in Swadeshi through the Khilafat movement, if it could not legitimately help that movement, but conceived as non-co-operation was, in a spirit of self-sacrifice, Swadeshi had a legitimate place in the movement. Pure Swadeshi meant sacrifice of the liking for fineries. He asked the nation to sacrifice its liking for the fineries of Europe and Japan and be satisfied with the coarse but beautiful fabrics woven on their handlooms out of yarns spun by millions of their sisters. If the nation had become really awakened to a sense of the danger to its religions and its self-respect, it could not but perceive the absolute and immediate necessity of the adoption of Swadeshi in its intense form and if the people of India adopted Swadeshi with the religious zeal he begged to assure them that its adoption would arm them with a new power and would produce an unmistakable impr
U||ession throughout the whole world. He, therefore, expected the Mussalmans to give the lead by giving up all the fineries they were so fond of and adopt the simple cloth that could be produced by the manual labour of their sisters and brethren in their own cottages. And he hoped that the Hindus would follow suit. It was a sacrifice in which the whole nation, every man, woman and child could take part.
U||RIDICULE REPLACING REPRESSION
U||Had His Excellency the Viceroy not made it impossible by his defiant attitude on the Punjab and the Khilafat, I would have tendered him hearty congratulations for substituting ridicule for repression in order to kill a movement distasteful to him. For, torn from its context and read by itself His Excellency’s discourse on non-co-operation is unexceptionable. It is a symptom of translation from savagery to civilization. Pouring ridicule on one’s opponent is an approved method in civilised politics. And if the method is consistently continued, it will mark an important improvement upon the official barbarity of the Punjab. His interpretation of Mr. Montagu’s statement about the movement is also not open to any objection whatsoever. Without doubt a government has the right to use sufficient force to put down an actual outbreak of violence.
U||But I regret to have to confess that this attempt to pour ridicule on the movement, read in conjunction with the sentiments on the Punjab and the Khilafat, preceding the ridicule, seems to show that His Excellency has made it a virtue of necessity. He has not finally abandoned the method of terrorism and frightfulness, but he finds the movement being conducted in such an open and truthful manner that any attempt to kill it by violent repression would not expose him not only to ridicule but contempt of all right-thinking men.
U||Let us however examine the adjectives used by His Excellency to kill the movement by laughing at it. It is ‘futile,’ ‘ill-advised,’ ‘intrinsically insane,’ ‘unpractical,’ ‘visionary.’ He has rounded off the adjectives by describing the movement as ‘most foolish of all foolish schemes.’ His Excellency has become so impatient of it that he has used all his vocabulary for showing the magnitude of the ridiculous nature of non-co-operation.
U||Unfortunately for His Excellency the movement is likely to grow with ridicule as it is certain to flourish on repression. No vital movement can be killed except by the impatience, ignorance or laziness of its authors. A movement cannot be ‘insane’ that is conducted by men of action as I claim the members of the Non-co-operation Committee are. It is hardly ‘unpractical,’ seeing that if the people respond, every one admits that it will achieve the end. At the same time it is perfectly true that if there is no response from the people, the movement will be popularly described as ‘visionary.’ It is for the nation to return an effective answer by organised non-co-operation and change ridicule into respect. Ridicule is like repression. Both give place to respect when they fail to produce the intended effect.
U||THE VICEREGAL PRONOUNCEMENT
U||It may be that having lost faith in His Excellency’s probity and capacity to hold the high office of Viceroy of India, I now read his speeches with a biased mind, but the speech His Excellency delivered at the time of opening of the council shows to me a mental attitude which makes association with him or his Government impossible for self-respecting men.
U||The remarks on the Punjab mean a flat refusal to grant redress. He would have us to ‘concentrate on the problems of the immediate future!’ The immediate future is to compel repentance on the part of the Government on the Punjab matter. Of this there is no sign. On the contrary, His Excellency resists the temptation to reply to his critics, meaning thereby that he has not changed his opinion on the many vital matters affecting the honour of India. He is ‘content to leave the issues to the verdict of history.’ Now this kind of language, in my opinion, is calculated further to inflame the Indian mind. Of what use can a favourable verdict of history be to men who have been wronged and who are still under the heels of officers who have shown themselves utterly unfit to hold offices of trust and responsibility? The plea for co-operation is, to say the least, hypocritical in the face of the determination to refuse justice to the Punjab. Can a patient who is suffering from an intolerable ache be soothed by t
U||he most tempting dishes placed before him? Will he not consider it mockery on the part of the physician who so tempted him without curing him of his pain?
U||His Excellency is, if possible, even less happy on the Khilafat. “So far as any Government could,” says this trustee for the nation, “we pressed upon the Peace Conference the views of Indian Moslems. But notwithstanding our efforts on their behalf we are threatened with a campaign of non-co-operation because, forsooth, the allied Powers found themselves unable to accept the contentions advanced by Indian Moslems.” This is most misleading if not untruthful. His Excellency knows that the peace terms are not the work of the allied Powers. He knows that Mr. Lloyd George is the prime author of terms and that the latter has never repudiated his responsibility for them. He has with amazing audacity justified them in spite of his considered pledge to the Moslems of India regarding Constantinople, Thrace and the rich and renowned lands of Asia minor. It is not truthful to saddle responsibility for the terms on the allied Powers when Great Britain alone has promoted them. The offence of the Viceroy becomes gre
U||ater when we remember that he admits the justness of the Muslim claim. He could not have ‘pressed’ it if he did not admit its justice.
U||I venture to think that His Excellency by his pronouncement on the Punjab has strengthened the nation in its efforts to seek a remedy to compel redress of the two wrongs before it can make anything of the so-called Reforms.
U||FROM RIDICULE, TO—?
U||It will be admitted that non-co-operation has passed the stage ridicule. Whether it will now be met by repression or respect remains to be seen. Opinion has already been expressed in these columns that ridicule is an approved and civilized method of opposition. The viceregal ridicule though expressed in unnecessarily impolite terms was not open to exception.
U||But the testing time has now arrived. In a civilized country when ridicule fails to kill a movement it begins to command respect. Opponents meet it by respectful and cogent argument and the mutual behaviour of rival parties never becomes violent. Each party seeks to convert the other or draw the uncertain element towards its side by pure argument and reasoning.
U||There is little doubt now that the boycott of the councils will be extensive if it is not complete. The students have become disturbed. Important institutions may any day become truly national. Pandit Motilal Nehru’s great renunciation of a legal practice which was probably second to nobody’s is by itself an event calculated to change ridicule into respect. It ought to set people thinking seriously about their own attitude. There must be something very wrong about our Government—to warrant the step Pundit Motilal Nehru has taken. Post graduate students have given up their fellowships. Medical students have refused to appear for their final examination. Non-co-operation in these circumstances cannot be called an inane movement.
U||Either the Government must bend to the will of the people which is being expressed in no unmistakable terms through non-co-operation, or it must attempt to crush the movement by repression.
U||Any force used by a government under any circumstance is not repression. An open trial of a person accused of having advocated methods of violence is not repression. Every State has the right to put down or prevent violence by force. But the trial of Mr. Zafar Ali Khan and two Moulvis of Panipat shows that the Government is seeking not to put down or prevent violence but to suppress expression of opinion, to prevent the spread of disaffection. This is repression. The trials are the beginning of it. It has not still assumed a virulent form but if these trials do not result in stilling the propaganda, it is highly likely that severe repression will be resorted to by the Government.
U||The only other way to prevent the spread of disaffection is to remove the causes thereof. And that would be to respect the growing response of the country to the programme of non-co-operation. It is too much to expect repentance and humility from a government intoxicated with success and power.
U||We must therefore assume that the second stage in the Government programme will be repression growing in violence in the same ratio as the progress of non-co-operation. And if the movement survives repression, the day of victory of truth is near. We must then be prepared for prosecutions, punishments even up to deportations. We must evolve the capacity for going on with our programme without the leaders. That means capacity for self-government. And as no government in the world can possibly put a whole nation in prison, it must yield to its demand or abdication in favour of a government suited to that nation.
U||It is clear that abstention from violence and persistence in the programme are our only and surest chance of attaining our end.
U||The government has its choice, either to respect the movement or to try to repress it by barbarous methods. Our choice is either to succumb to repression or to continue in spite of repression.
U||TO EVERY ENGLISHMAN IN INDIA
U||Dear Friend,
U||I wish that every Englishman will see this appeal and give thoughtful attention to it.
U||Let me introduce myself to you. In my humble opinion no Indian has co-operated with the British Government more than I have for an unbroken period of twenty-nine years of public life in the face of circumstances that might well have turned any other man into a rebel. I ask you to believe me when I tell you that my co-operation was not based on the fear of the punishments provided by your laws or any other selfish motives. It was free and voluntary co-operation based on the belief that the sum total of the activity of the British Government was for the benefit of India. I put my life in peril four times for the sake of the Empire,—at the time of the Boer war when I was in charge of the Ambulance corps whose work was mentioned in General Buller’s dispatches, at the time of the Zulu revolt in Natal when I was in charge of a similar corps at the time of the commencement of the late war when I raised an Ambulance corps and as a result of the strenuous training had a severe attack of pleurisy, and lastly, in f
U||ulfilment of my promise to Lord Chelmsford at the War Conference in Delhi. I threw myself in such an active recruiting campaign in Kuira District involving long and trying marches that I had an attack of dysentry which proved almost fatal. I did all this in the full belief that acts such as mine must gain for my country an equal status in the Empire. So late as last December I pleaded hard for a trustful co-operation, I fully believed that Mr. Lloyd George would redeem his promise to the Mussalmans and that the revelations of the official atrocities in the Punjab would secure full reparation for the Punjabis. But the treachery of Mr. Lloyd George and its appreciation by you, and the condonation of the Punjab atrocities have completely shattered my faith in the good intentions of the Government and the nation which is supporting it.
U||But though, my faith in your good intentions is gone, I recognise your bravery and I know that what you will not yield to justice and reason, you will gladly yield to bravery.
U||See what this Empire means to India
U||Exploitation of India’s resources for the benefit of Great Britain.
U||An ever-increasing military expenditure, and a civil service the most expensive in the world.
U||Extravagant working of every department in utter disregard of India’s poverty.
U||Disarmament and consequent emasculation of a whole nation lest an armed nation might imperil the lives of a handful of you in our midst. Traffic in intoxicating liquors and drugs for the purposes of sustaining a top heavy administration.
U||Progressively representative legislation in order to suppress an evergrowing agitation seeking to give expression to a nation’s agony.
U||Degrading treatment of Indians residing in your dominions, and
U||You have shown total disregard of our feelings by glorifying the Punjab administration and flouting the Mosulman sentiment.
U||I know you would not mind if we could fight and wrest the sceptre form your hands. You know that we are powerless to do that, for you have ensured our incapacity to fight in open and honourable battle. Bravery on the battlefield is thus impossible for us. Bravery of the soul still remains open to us. I know you will respond to that also. I am engaged in evoking that bravery. Non-co-operation means nothing less than training in self-sacrifice. Why should we co-operate with you when we know that by your administration of this great country we are lifting daily enslaved in an increasing degree. This response of the people to my appeal is not due to my personality. I would like you to dismiss me, and for that matter the Ali Brothers too, from your consideration. My personality will fail to evoke any response to anti-Muslim cry if I were foolish enough to rise it, as the magic name of the Ali Brothers would fail to inspire the Mussalmans with enthusiasm if they were madly to raise in anti-Hindu cry. People flock 
U||in their thousands to listen to us because we to-day represent the voice of a nation groaning under iron heels. The Ali Brothers were your friends as I was, and still am. My religion forbids me to bear any ill-will towards you. I would not raise my hand against you even if I had the power. I expect to conquer you only by my suffering. The Ali Brothers will certainly draw the sword, if they could, in defence of their religion and their country. But they and I have made common cause with the people of India in their attempt to voice their feelings and to find a remedy for their distress.
U||You are in search of a remedy to suppress this rising ebullition of national feeling. I venture to suggest to you that the only way to suppress it is to remove the causes. You have yet the power. You can repent of the wrongs done to Indians. You can compel Mr. Lloyd George to redeem his promises. I assure you he has kept many escape doors. You can compel the Viceroy to retire in favour of a better one, you can revise your ideas about Sir Michael O’Dwyer and General Dyer. You can compel the Government to summon a conference of the recognised lenders of the people, duly elected by them and representing all shades of opinion so as to devise means for granting Swaraj in accordance with the wishes of the people of India. But this you cannot do unless you consider every Indian to be in reality your equal and brother. I ask for no patronage, I merely point out to you, as a friend, as honourable solution of a grave problem. The other solution, namely repression is open to YOU. I prophesy that it will fail. It has 
U||begun already. The Government has already imprisoned two brave men of Panipat for holding and expressing their opinions freely. Another is on his trial in Lahore for having expressed similar opinion. One in the Oudh District is already imprisoned. Another awaits judgment. You should know what is going on in your midst. Our propaganda is being carried on in anticipation of repression. I invite you respectfully to choose the better way and make common cause with the people of India whose salt you are eating. To seek to thwart their inspirations is disloyalty to the country.
U||I am, Your faithful friend, M. K. GANDHI
U||ONE STEP ENOUGH FOR ME
U||Mr. Stokes is a Christian, who wants to follow the light that God gives him. He has adopted India as his home. He is watching the non-co-operation movement from the Kotgarh hills where he is living in isolation from the India of the plains and serving the hillmen. He has contributed three articles on non-co-operation to the columns of the Servant of Calcutta and other papers. I had the pleasure of reading them during my Bengal tour. Mr. Stokes approves of non-co-operation but dreads the consequences that may follow complete success i.e., evacuation of India by the British. He conjures up before his mind a picture of India invaded by the Afghans from the North-West, plundered by the Gurkhas from the Hills. For me I say with Cardinal Newman: ‘I do not ask to see the distant scene; one step enough for me.’ The movement is essentially religious. The business of every god-fearing man is to dissociate himself from evil in total disregard of consequences. He must have faith in a good deed producing only a good 
U||result: that in my opinion is the Gita doctrine of work without attachment. God does not permit him to peep into the future. He follows truth although the following of it may endanger his very life. He knows that it is better to die in the way of God than to live in the way of Satan. Therefore who ever is satisfied that this Government represents the activity of Satan has no choice left to him but to dissociate himself from it.
U||However, let us consider the worst that can happen to India on a sudden evacuation of India by the British. What does it matter that the Gurkhas and the Pathans attack us? Surely we would be better able to deal with their violence than we are with the continued violence, moral and physical, perpetrated by the present Government. Mr. Stokes does not seem to eschew the use of physical force. Surely the combined labour of the Rajput, the Sikh and the Mussalman warriors in a united India may be trusted to deal with plunderers from any or all the sides. Imagine however the worst: Japan overwhelming us from the Bay of Bengal, the Gurkhas from the Hills, and the Pathans from the North-West. If we not succeed in driving them out we make terms with them and drive them at the first opportunity. This will be a more manly course than a hopeless submission to an admittedly wrongful State.
U||But I refuse to contemplate the dismal out-look. If the movement succeeds through non-violent non-co-operation, and that is the supposition Mr. Stokes has started with, the English whether they remain or retire, they will do so as friends and under a well-ordered agreement as between partners. I still believe in the goodness of human nature, whether it is English or any other. I therefore do not believe that the English will leave in a night.
U||And do I consider the Gurkha and the Afghan being incorrigible thieves and robbers without ability to respond to purifying influences? I do not. If India returns to her spirituality, it will react upon the neighbouring tribes, she will interest herself in the welfare of these hardy but poor people, and even support them if necessary, not out of fear but as a matter of neighbourly duty. She will have dealt with Japan simultaneously with the British. Japan will not want to invade India, if India has learnt to consider it a sin to use a single foreign article that she can manufacture within her own borders. She produces enough to eat and her men and women can without difficulty manufacture enough to clothe to cover their nakedness and protect themselves from heat and cold. We become prey to invasion if we excite the greed of foreign nation, by dealing with them under a feeling dependence on them. We must learn to be independent of every one of them.
U||Whether therefore we finally succeed through violence or non-violence in my opinion, the prospect is by no means so gloomy as Mr. Stokes has imagined. Any conceivable prospect is, in my opinion, less black than the present unmanly and helpless condition. And we cannot do better than following out fearlessly and with confidence the open and honourable programme of non-violence and sacrifice that we have mapped for ourselves.
U||THE NEED FOR HUMILITY
U||The spirit of non-violence necessarily leads to humility. Non-violence means reliance on God, the Rocks of ages. If we would seek His aid, we must approach Him with a humble and a contrite heart. Non-co-operationists may not trade upon their amazing success at the Congress. We must act, even as the mango tree which drops as it bears fruit. Its grandeur lies in its majestic lowliness. But one hears of non-co-operationists being insolent and intolerant in their behaviour towards those who differ from them. I know that they will lose all their majesty and glory, if they betray any inflation. Whilst we may not be dissatisfied with the progress made so far, we have little to our credit to make us feel proud. We have to sacrifice much more than we have done to justify pride, much less elation. Thousands, who flocked to the Congress pandal, have undoubtedly given their intellectual assent to the doctrine but few have followed it out in practice. Leaving aside the pleaders, how many parents have withdrawn their chil
U||dren from schools? How many of those who registered their vote in favour of non-co-operation have taken to hand-spinning or discarded the use of all foreign cloth?
U||Non-co-operation is not a movement of brag, bluster, or bluff. It is a test of our sincerity. It requires solid and silent self-sacrifice. It challenges our honesty and our capacity for national work. It is a movement that aims at translating ideas into action. And the more we do, the more we find that much more must be done than we have expected. And this thought of our imperfection must make us humble.
U||A non-co-operationist strives to compel attention and to set an example not by his violence but by his unobtrusive humility. He allows his solid action to speak for his creed. His strength lies in his reliance upon the correctness of his position. And the conviction of it grows most in his opponent when he least interposes his speech between his action and his opponent. Speech, especially when it is haughty, betrays want of confidence and it makes one’s opponent sceptical about the reality of the act itself. Humility therefore is the key to quick success. I hope that every non-co-operationist will recognise the necessity of being humble and self-restrained. It is because so little is really required to be done because all of that little depends entirely upon ourselves that I have ventured the belief that Swaraj is attainable in less than one year.
U||SOME QUESTIONS ANSWERED
U||“I write to thank you for yours of the 7th instant and especially for your request that I should after reading your writings in “Young India” on non-co-operation, give a full and frank criticism of them. I know that your sole desire is to find out the truth and to act accordingly, and hence I venture to make the following remarks. In the issue of May 5th you say that non-co-operation is “not even anti-Government.” But surely to refuse to have anything to do with the Government to the extent of not serving it and of not paying its taxes is actually, if not theoretically anti-Government; and such a course must ultimately make all Government impossible. Again, you say, “It is the inherent right of a subject to refuse to assist a government that will not listen to him.” Leaving aside the question of the ethical soundness of this proposition, may I ask which Government, in the present case? Has not the Indian Government done all it possibly can in the matter? Then if its attempts to voice the reques
U||t of India should fail, would it be fair and just to do anything against it? Would not the proper course be non-co-operation with the Supreme Council of the Allies, including Great Britain, if it be found that the latter has failed properly to support the demand of the Indian Government and people? It seems to me that in all your writings and speeches you forget that in the present question both Government and people are as one, and if they fail to get what they justly want, how does the question of non-co-operation arise? Hindus and Englishmen and the Government are all at present “shouldering in a full-hearted manner the burden that Muhomedans of India are carrying etc. etc.” But supposing we fail of our object—what then? Are we all to refuse to co-operate and with whom?
U||Might I recommend the consideration of the following course of conduct?
U||(1) “Wait and see” what the actual terms of the Treaty with Turkey are?
U||(2) If they are not in accordance with the aspirations and recommendations of the Government and the people of India, the every legitimate effort should be made to have the terms revised.
U||(3) To the bitter end, co-operate with a Government that co-operates with us, and only when it refuses co-operation, go in for non-co-operation.
U||So far I personally see no reason whatsoever for non-co-operation with the Indian Government, and till it fails to voice the needs and demands of India as a whole there can be no reason. The Indian Government does some times make mistakes, but in the Khilafat matter it is sound and therefore deserves or ought to have the sympathetic and whole-hearted co-operation of every one in India. I hope that you will kindly consider the above and perhaps you will be able to find time for a reply in Young India.”
U||I gladly make room for the above letter and respond to the suggestion to give a public reply as no doubt the difficulty experienced by the English friend is experienced by many. Causes are generally lost, not owing to the determined opposition of men who will not see the truth as they want to perpetuate an injustice but because they are able to enlist in their favour the allegiance of those who are anxious to understand a particular cause and take sides after mature judgment. It is only by patient argument with such honest men that one is able to check oneself, correct one’s own errors of judgment and at times to wean them from their error and bring them over to one’s side. This Khilafat question is specially difficult because there are so many side-issues. It is therefore no wonder that many have more or less difficulty in making up their minds. It is further complicated because the painful necessity for some direct action has arisen in connection with it. But whatever the difficulty, I am convinced tha
U||t there is no question so important as this one if we want harmony and peace in India.
U||My friend objects to my statement that non-co-operation is not anti-Government, because he considers that refusal to serve it and pay its taxes is actually anti-Government. I respectfully dissent from the view. If a brother has fundamental differences with his brother, and association with the latter involves his partaking of what in his opinion is an injustice. I hold that it is brotherly duty to refrain from serving his brother and sharing his earnings with him. This happens in everyday life. Prahalad did not act against his father, when he declined to associate himself with the latter’s blasphemies. Nor was Jesus anti-Jewish when he declaimed against the Pharisees and the hypocrites, and would have none of them. In such matters, is it not intention that determines the character of a particular act? It is hardly correct as the friend suggests that withdrawal of association under general circumstances would make all government impossible. But it is true that such withdrawal would make all injustice imposs
U||ible.
U||My correspondent considers that the Government of India having done all it possibly could, non-co-operation could not be applicable to that Government. In my opinion, whilst it is true that the Government of India has done a great deal, it has not done half as much as it might have done, and might even now do. No Government can absolve itself from further action beyond protesting, when it realises that the people whom it represents feel as keenly as do lakhs of Indian Mussalmans in the Khilafat question. No amount of sympathy with a starving man can possibly avail. He must have bread or he dies, and what is wanted at that critical moment is some exertion to fetch the wherewithal to feed the dying man. The Government of India can to-day heed the agitation and ask, to the point of insistence for full vindication of the pledged word of a British Minister. Has the Government of India resigned by way of protest against the threatened, shameful betrayal of trust on the part of Mr. Lloyd George? Why does the Govern
U||ment of India hide itself behind secret despatches? At a less critical moment Lord Hardiage committed a constitutional indiscretion, openly sympathised with South African Passive Resistance movement and stemmed the surging tide of public indignation in India, though at the same time he incurred the wrath of the then South African Cabinet and some public men in Great Britain. After all, the utmost that the Government of India has done is on its own showing to transmit and press the Mahomedan claim. Was that not the least it could have done? Could it have done anything less without covering itself with disgrace? What Indian Mahomedans and the Indian public expect the Government of India to do at this critical juncture is not the least, but the utmost that it could do. Viceroys have been known to tender resignations for much smaller causes. Wounded pride brought forth not very long ago the resignation of a Lieutenant Governor. On the Khilafat question, a sacred cause dear to the hearts of several million Mahome
U||dans is in danger of being wounded. I would therefore invite the English friend, and every Englishman in India, and every Hindu, be he moderate or extremist, to make common cause with the Mahomedans and thereby compel the Government of India to do its duty, and thereby compel His Majesty’s Ministers to do theirs.
U||There has been much talk of violence ensuing from active non-co-operation. I venture to suggest that the Mussalmans of India, if they had nothing in the shape of non-co-operation in view, would have long ago yielded to counsels of despair. I admit that non-co-operation is not unattended with danger. But violence is a certainty without, violence is only a possibility with non-co-operation. And it will he a greater possibility if all the important men, English, Hindu and others of the country discountenance it.
U||I think, that the recommendation made by the friend is being literally followed by the Mahomedans. Although they practically know the fate, they are waiting for the actual terms of the treaty with Turkey. They are certainly going to try every means at their disposal to have the terms revised before beginning non-co-operation. And there will certainly be no non-co-operation commenced so long as there is even hope of active co-operation on the part of the Government of India with the Mahomedans, that is, co-operation strong enough to secure a revision of the terms should they be found to be in conflict with the pledges of British statesmen. But if all these things fail, can Mahomedans as men of honour who hold their religion dearer than their lives do anything less than wash their hands clean of the guilt of British Ministers and the Government of India by refusing to co-operate with them? And can Hindus and Englishmen, if they value Mahomedan friendship, and if they admit then full justice of the Mahomaden fr
U||iendship and if they admit the full justice of the Mahomedan claim do otherwise than heartily support the Mahomedans by word and deed.
U||PLEDGES BROKEN
U||After the forgoing was printed the long-expected peace terms regarding Turkey were received. In my humble opinion they are humiliating to the Supreme Council, to the British ministers, and if as a Hindu with deep reverence for Christianity I may say so, a denial of Christ’s teachings. Turkey broken down and torn with dissentions within may submit to the arrogant disposal of herself, and Indian Mahomedans may out of fear do likewise. Hindus out of fear, apathy or want of appreciation of the situation, may refuse to help their Mahomedan brethren in their hour of peril. The fact remains that a solemn promise of the Prime Minister of England has been wantonly broken. I will say nothing about President Wilson’s fourteen points, for they seem now to be entirely forgotten as a day’s wonder. It is a matter of deep sorrow that the Government of India communique offers a defence of the terms, calls them a fulfilment of Mr. Lloyd George’s pledge of 5th January 1918 and yet apologises for their defective nature 
U||and appeals to the Mahomedans of India as if to mock them that they would accept the terms with quiet resignation. The mask that veils the hypocrisy is too thin to deceive anybody. It would have been dignified if the communique had boldly admitted Mr. Lloyd George’s mistake in having made the promise referred to. As it is, the claim of fulfilment of the promise only adds to the irritation caused by its glaring breach. What is the use of the Viceroy saying, “The question of the Khilafat is one for the Mahomedans and Mahomedans only and that with their free choice in the matter Government have no desire to interfere,” while the Khalif’s dominions are ruthlessly dismembered, his control of the Holy places of Islam shamelessly taken away from him and he himself reduced to utter impotence in his own palace which can no longer be called a palace but which can he more fitly described us a prison? No wonder, His Excellency fears that the peace includes “terms which must be painful to all Moslems.” Why sh
U||ould he insult Muslim intelligence by sending the Mussalmans of India a of encouragement and sympathy? Are they expected to find encouragement in the cruel recital of the arrogant terms or in a remembrance of ‘the splendid response’ made by them to the call of the King ‘in the day of the Empire’s need.’ It ill becomes His Excellency to talk of the triumph of those ideals of justice and humanity for which the Allies fought. Indeed, the terms of the so called peace with Turkey if they are to last, will be a monument of human arrogance and man-made injustice. To attempt to crush the spirit of a brave and gallant race, because it has lost in the fortunes of war, is a triumph not of humanity but a demonstration of inhumanity. And if Turkey enjoyed the closest ties of friendship with Great Britain before the war, Great Britain has certainly made ample reparation for her mistake by having made the largest contribution to the humiliation of Turkey. It is insufferable therefore when the Viceroy feels confid
U||ent that with the conclusion of this new treaty that friendship will quickly take life again and a Turkey regenerate full of hope and strength, will stand forth in the future as in the past a pillar of the Islamic faith. The Viceregal message audaciously concludes, “This thought will I trust strengthen you to accept the peace terms with resignation, courage and fortitude and to keep your loyalty towards the Crown bright and untarnished as it has been for so many generations.” If Muslim loyalty remains untarnished it will certainly not be for want of effort on the part of the Government of India to put the heaviest strain upon it, but it will remain so because the Mahomedans realise their own strength—the strength in the knowledge that their cause is just and that they have got the power to vindicate justice in spite of the aberration suffered by Great Britain under a Prime Minister whom continued power has made as reckless in making promises as in breaking them.
U||Whilst therefore I admit that there is nothing either in the peace terms or in the Viceregal message covering them to inspire the Mahomedans and Indians in general with confidence or hope, I venture to suggest that there is no cause for despair and anger. Now is the time for Mahomedans to retain absolute self-control, to unite their forces and, weak though they are, with firm faith in God to carry on the struggle with redoubled vigour till justice is done. If India—both Hindu and Mahomedan—can act as one man and can withdraw her partnership in this crime against humanity which the peace terms represent, she will soon secure a revision of the treaty and give herself and the Empire at least, if not the world, a lasting peace. There is no doubt that the struggle would be bitter sharp and possibly prolonged, but it is worth all the sacrifice that it is likely to call forth. Both the Mussalmans and the Hindus are on their trial. Is the humiliation of the Khilafat a matter of concern to the former? And if it i
U||s, are they prepared to exercise restraint, religiously refrain from violence and practise non-co-operation without counting the material loss it may entail upon the community? Do the Hindus honestly feel for their Mahomedan brethren to the extent of sharing their sufferings to the fullest extent? The answer to these questions and not the peace terms, will finally decide the fate of the Khilafat.
U||MORE OBJECTIONS ANSWERED
U||Swadeshmitran is one of the most influential Tamil dailies of Madras. It is widely read. Everything appearing in its columns is entitled to respect. The Editor has suggested some practical difficulty in the way of non-co-operation. I would therefore like, to the best of my ability, to deal with them.
U||I do not know where the information has been derived from that I have given up the last two stages of non-co-operation. What I have said is that they are a distant goal. I abide by it. I admit that all the stages are fraught with some danger, but the last two are fraught with the greatest—the last most of all. The stages have been fixed with a view to running the least possible risk. The last two stages will not be taken up unless the committee has attained sufficient control over the people to warrant the beliefs that the laying down of arms or suspension of taxes will, humanly speaking, be free from an outbreak of violence on the part of the people. I do entertain the belief that it is possible for the people to attain the discipline necessary for taking the two steps. When once they realise that violence is totally unnecessary to bend an unwilling government to their will and that the result can be obtained with certainty by dignified non-co-operation, they will cease to think of violence even by way of
U|| retaliation. The fact is that hitherto we have not attempted to take concerted and disciplined action from the masses. Some day, if we are to become truly a self-governing nation, that attempt has to be made. The present, in my opinion, is a propitious movement. Every Indian feels the insult to the Punjab as a personal wrong, every Mussalman resents the wrong done to the Khilafat. There is therefore a favourable atmosphere for expecting cohesive and restrained movement on the part of the masses.
U||So far as response is concerned, I agree with the Editor that the quickest and the largest response is to be expected in the matter of suspension of payment of taxes, but as I have said so long as the masses are not educated to appreciate the value of non-violence even whilst their holding are being sold, so long must it be difficult to take up the last stage into any appreciable extent.
U||I agree too that a sudden withdrawal of the military and the police will be a disaster if we have not acquired the ability to protect ourselves against robbers and thieves. But I suggest that when we are ready to call out the military and the police on an extensive scale we would find ourselves in a position to defend ourselves. If the police and the military resign from patriotic motives, I would certainly expect them to perform the same duty as national volunteers, not has hirelings but as willing protectors of the life and liberty of their countrymen. The movement of non-co-operation is one of automatic adjustment. If the Government schools are emptied, I would certainly expect national schools to come into being. If the lawyers as a whole suspended practice, they would devise arbitration courts and the nation will have expeditions and cheaper method of setting private disputes and awarding punishment to the wrong-doer. I may add that the Khilafat Committee is fully alive to the difficulty of the task and
U|| is taking all the necessary steps to meet the contingencies as they arise.
U||Regarding the leaving of civil employment, no danger is feared, because no one will leave his employment, unless he is in a position to find support for himself and family either through friends or otherwise.
U||Disapproval of the proposed withdrawal of students betrays, in my humble opinion, lack of appreciation of the true nature of non-co-operation. It is true enough that we pay the money wherewith our children are educated. But, when the agency imparting the education has become corrupt, we may not employ it without partaking of the agents, corruption. When students leave schools or colleges I hardly imagine that the teachers will fail to perceive the advisability of themselves resigning. But even if they do not, money can hardly be allowed to count where honour or religion are at the stake.
U||As to the boycott of the councils, it is not the entry of the Moderates or any other persons that matters so much as the entry of those who believe in non-co-operation. You may not co-operate at the top and non-co-operate at the bottom. A councillor cannot remain in the council and ask the gumasta who cleans the council-table to resign.
U||MR. PENNINGTON’S OBJECTIONS ANSWERED
U||I gladly publish Mr. Pennington’s letter with its enclosure just as I have received them. Evidently Mr. Pennington is not a regular reader of ‘Young India,’ or he would have noticed that no one has condemned mob outrages more than I have. He seems to think that the article he has objected to was the only thing I have ever written on General Dyer. He does not seem to know that I have endeavoured with the utmost impartiality to examine the Jallianwala massacre. And he can see any day all the proof adduced by my fellow-commissioners and myself in support of our findings on the massacre. The ordinary readers of ‘Young India’ knew all the facts and therefore it was unnecessary for me to support my assertion otherwise. But unfortunately Mr. Pennington represents the typical Englishman. He does not want to be unjust, nevertheless he is rarely just in his appreciation of world events because he has no time to study them except cursorily and that through a press whose business is to air only party views. Th
U||e average Englishman therefore except in parochial matters is perhaps the least informed though he claims to be well-informed about every variety of interest. Mr. Pennington’s ignorance is thus typical of the others and affords the best reason for securing control of our own affairs in our own hands. Ability will come with use and not by waiting to be trained by those whose natural interest is to prolong the period of tutelage as much as possible.
U||But to return to Mr. Pennington’s letter he complains that there has been no ‘proper trial of any one.’ The fault is not ours. India has consistently and insistently demanded a trial of all the officers concerned in the crimes against the Punjab.
U||He next objects to be ‘violence’ of my language. If truth is violent, I plead guilty to the charge of violence of language. But I could not, without doing violence to truth, refrain from using the language, I have, regarding General Dyer’s action. It has been proved out of his own mouth or hostile witnesses:
U||(1) That the crowd was unarmed.
U||(2) That it contained children.
U||(3) That the 13th was the day of Vaisakhi fair.
U||(4) That thousands had come to the fair.
U||(5) That there was no rebellion.
U||(6) That during the intervening two days before the ‘massacre’ there was peace in Amritsar.
U||(7) That the proclamation of the meeting was made the same day as General Dyer’s proclamation.
U||(8) That General Dyer’s proclamation prohibited not meetings but processions or gatherings of four men on the streets and not in private or public places.
U||(9) That General Dyer ran no risk whether outside or inside the city.
U||(10) That he admitted himself that many in the crowd did not know anything of his proclamation.
U||(11) That he fired without warning the crowd and even after it had begun to disperse. He fired on the backs of the people who were in flight.
U||(12) That the men were practically penned in an enclosure.
U||In the face of these admitted facts I do call the deed a ‘massacre.’ The action amounted not to ‘an error of judgment’ but its ‘paralysis in the face of fancied danger.’
U||I am sorry to have to say that Mr. Pennington’s notes, which too the reader will find published elsewhere, betray as much ignorance as his letter.
U||Whatever was adopted on paper in the days of Canning was certainly not translated into action in its full sense. ‘Promises made to the ear were broken to the hope,’ was said by a reactionary Viceroy. Military expenditure has grown enormously since the days of Canning.
U||The demonstration in favour of General Dyer is practically a myth.
U||No trace was found of the so-called Danda Fauj dignified by the name of bludgeon-army by Mr. Pennington. There was no rebel army in Amritsar. The crown that committed the horrible murders and incendiarism contained no one community exclusively. The sheet was found posted only in Lahore and not in Amritsar. Mr. Pennington should moreover have known by this time that the meeting held on the 13th was held, among other things, for the purpose of condemning mob excesses. This was brought out at the Amritsar trial. Those who surrounded him could not stop General Dyer. He says he made up his mind to shoot in a moment. He consulted nobody. When the correspondent says that the troops would have objected to being concerned in ‘what might in that case be not unfairly called a ‘massacre,’ he writes as if he had never lived in India. I wish the Indian troops had the moral courage to refuse to shoot innocent, unarmed men in full flight. But the Indian troops have been brought in too slavish an atmosphere to dare do 
U||any such correct act.
U||I hope Mr. Pennington will not accuse me again of making unverified assertions because I have not quoted from the books. The evidence is there for him to use. I can only assure him that the assertions are based on positive proofs mostly obtained from official sources.
U||Mr. Pennington wants me to publish an exact account of what happened on the 10th April. He can find it in the reports, and if he will patiently go through them he will discover that Sir Michael O’Dwyer and his officials goaded the people into frenzied fury—a fury which nobody, as I have already said, has condemned more than I have. The account of the following days is summed up in one word, viz. ‘peace’ on the part of the crowd disturbed by indiscriminate arrests, the massacre and the series of official crimes that followed.
U||I am prepared to give Mr. Pennington credit for seeking after the truth. But he has gone about it in the wrong manner. I suggest his reading the evidence before the Hunter Committee and the Congress Committee. He need not read the reports. But the evidence will convince him that I have understated the case against General Dyer.
U||When however I read his description of himself as “for 12 years Chief Magistrate of Districts in the South of India before reform, by assassination and otherwise, became so fashionable.” I despair of his being able to find the truth. An angry or a biased man renders himself incapable of finding it. And Mr. Pennington is evidently both angry and biased. What does he mean by saying, “before reform by assassination and otherwise became so fashionable?” It ill becomes him to talk of assassination when the school of assassination seems happily to have become extinct. Englishmen will never see the truth so long as they permit their vision to be blinded by arrogant assumption of superiority or ignorant assumptions of infallibility.
U||MR. PENNINGTON’S LETTER TO MR. GANDHI
U||Dear Sir,
U||I do not like your scheme for “boycotting” the Government of India under what seems to be the somewhat less offensive (though more cumbrous) name of non-co-operation; but have always given you credit for a genuine desire to carry out revolution by peaceful means and am astonished at the violence of the language you use in describing General Dyer on page 4 of your issue of the 14th July last. You begin by saying that he is “by no means the worst offender,” and, so far, I am inclined to agree, though as there has been no proper trial of anyone it is impossible to apportion their guilt; but then you say “his brutality is unmistakable,” “his abject and unsoldierlike cowardice is apparent, he has called an unarmed crowd of men and children—mostly holiday makers—a rebel army.” “He believes himself to be the saviour of the Punjab in that he was able to shoot down like rabbits men who were penned in an enclosure; such a man is unworthy to be considered a soldier. There was no bravery in his act
U||ion. He ran no risk. He shot without the slightest opposition and without warning. This is not an error of judgement. It is paralysis of it in the face of fancied danger. It is proof of criminal incapacity and heartlessness,” etc.
U||You must excuse me for saying that all this is mere rhetoric unsupported by any proof, even where proof was possible. To begin with, neither you nor I were present at the Jallianwalla Bagh on that dreadful day—dreadful especially for General Dyer for whom you show no sympathy,—and therefore cannot know for certain whether the crowd was or was not unarmed.’ That it was an ‘illegal,’ because a ‘prohibited,’ assembly is evident; for it is absurd to suppose that General Dyer’s 4-1/2 hours march, through the city that very morning, during the whole of which he was warning the inhabitants against the danger of any sort of gathering, was not thoroughly well-known. You say they were ‘mostly holiday makers,’ but you give nor proof; and the idea of holiday gathering in Amritsar just then in incredible. I cannot understand your making such a suggestion. General Dyer was not the only officer present on the occasion and it is impossible to suppose that he would have been allowed to go on shooting into
U|| an innocent body of holiday-makers. Even the troops would have refused to carry out what might then have been not unfairly called a “massacre.”
U||I notice that you never even allude to the frightful brutality of the mob which was immediately responsible for the punitive measure reluctantly adopted by General Dyer. Your sympathies seem to be only with the murderers, and I am not sanguine enough to suppose that my view of the case will have much influence with you. Still I am bound to do what I can to get at the truth, and enclose a copy of some notes I have had occasion to make. If you can publish an exact account of what happened at Amritsar on the 10th of April, 1919 and the following days, especially on the 13th, including the demonstration in favour of General Dyer, (if there was one), I for one, as a mere seeker after the truth, should be very much obliged to you. Mere abuse is not convincing, as you so often observe in your generally reasonable paper,
U||Yours faithfully, J. R. PENNINGTON, I.O.S. (Retd.) 35, VICTORIA ROAD, WORTHING, SUSSEX 27th Aug. 1920.
U||For 12 years Chief Magistrate of Districts in the south of India before reform, by assassination and otherwise, became so fashionable.
U||P.S. Let us get the case in this way. General Dyer, acting as the only representative of Government on the spot shot some hundreds of people (some of them perhaps innocently mixed up in an illegal assembly), in the bona fide belief that he was dealing with the remains of a very dangerous rebellion and was thereby saving the lives of very many thousands, and in the opinion of a great many people did actually save the city from falling in the hands of a dangerous mob.
U||SOME DOUBTS
U||Babu Janakdhari Prasad was a staunch coworker with me in Champaran. He has written a long letter setting forth his reasons for his belief that India has a great mission before her, and that she can achieve her purpose only by non-violent non-co-operation. But he has doubts which he would have me answer publicly. The letter being long, I am withholding. But the doubts are entitled to respect and I must endeavour to answer them. Here they are us framed by Bubu Janakdhari Prasad.
U||(a) Is not the non-co-operation movement creating a sort of race-hatred between Englishmen and Indians, and is it in accordance with the Divine plan of universal love and brotherhood?
U||(b) Does not the use of words “devilish,” “satanic,” etc., savour of unbrotherly sentiment and incite feelings of hatred?
U||(c) Should not the non-co-operation movement be conducted on strictly non-violent and non-emotional lines both in speech and action?
U||(d) Is there no danger of the movement going out of control and lending to violence?
U||As to (a), I must say that the movement is not ‘creating’ race-hatred. It certainly gives, as I have already said, disciplined expression to it. You cannot eradicate evil by ignoring it. It is because I want to promote universal brotherhood that I have taken up non-co-operation so that, by self-purification, India may make the world better than it is.
U||As to (b), I know that the words ‘satanic’ and ‘devilish’ are strong, but they relate the exact truth. They describe a system not persons: We are bound to hate evil, if we would shun it. But by means of non-co-operation we are able to distinguish between the evil and the evil-doer. I have found no difficulty in describing a particular activity of a brother of mine to be devilish, but I am not aware of having harboured any hatred about him. Non-co-operation teaches us to love our fellowmen in spite of their faults, not by ignoring or over-looking them.
U||As to (c), the movement is certainly being conducted on strictly non-violent lines. That all non-co-operators have not yet thoroughly imbibed the doctrine is true. But that just shows what an evil legacy we have inherited. Emotion there is in the movement. And it will remain. A man without emotion is a man without feeling.
U||As to (d), there certainly is danger of the movement becoming violent. But we may no more drop non-violent non-co-operation because of its dangers, than we may stop freedom because of the danger of its abuse.
U||REJOINDER
U||Messrs. Popley and Philips have been good enough to reply to my letter “To Every Englishman in India.” I recognise and appreciate the friendly spirit of their letter. But I see that there are fundamental differences which must for the time being divide them and me. So long as I felt that, in spite of grievous lapses the British Empire represented an activity for the worlds and India’s good, I clung to it like a child to its mother’s breast. But that faith is gone. The British nation has endorsed the Punjab and Khilsfat crimes. The is no doubt a dissenting minority. But a dissenting minority that satisfies itself with a mere expression of its opinion and continues to help the wrong-doer partakes in wrong-doing.
U||And when the sum total of his energy represents a minus quantity one may not pick out the plus quantities, hold them up for admiration, and ask an admiring public to help regarding them. It is a favourite design of Satan to temper evil with a show of good and thus lure the unwary into the trap. The only way the world has known of defeating Satan is by shunning him. I invite Englishmen, who could work out the ideal the believe in, to join the ranks of the non-co-operationists. W.T. Stead prayed for the reverse of the British arms during the Boer war. Miss Hobbhouse invited the Boers to keep up the fight. The betrayal of India is much worse than the injustice done to the Boers. The Boers fought and bled for their rights. When therefore, we are prepared to bleed, the right will have become embodied, and idolatrous world will perceive it and do homage to it.
U||But Messers. Popley and Phillips object that I have allied myself with those who would draw the sword if they could. I see nothing wrong in it. They represent the right no less than I do. And is it not worth while trying to prevent an unsheathing of the sword by helping to win the bloodless battle? Those who recognise the truth of the Indian position can only do God’s work by assisting this non-violent campaign.
U||The second objection raised by these English friends is more to the point. I would be guilty of wrong-doing myself if the Muslim cause was not just. The fact is that the Muslim claim is not to perpetuate foreign domination of non-Muslim or Turkish races. The Indian Mussalmans do not resist self-determination, but they would fight to the last the nefarious plan of exploiting Mesopotamia under the plea of self-determination. They must resist the studied attempt to humiliate Turkey and therefore Islam, under the false pretext of ensuring Armenian independence.
U||The third objection has reference to schools. I do object to missionary or any schools being carried on with Government money. It is true that it was at one time our money. Will these good missionaries be justified in educating me with funds given to them by a robber who has robbed me of my money, religion and honour because the money was originally mine.
U||I personally tolerated the financial robbery of India, but it would have been a sin to have tolerated the robbery of honour through the Punjab, and of religion through Turkey. This is strong language. But nothing less would truly describe my deep conviction. Needless to add that the emptying of Government aided, or affiliated, schools does not mean starving the young mind National Schools are coming into being as fast as the others are emptied.
U||Messrs. Popley and Phillips think that my sense of justice has been blurred by the knowledge of the Punjab and the Khilafat wrongs. I hope not. I have asked friends to show me some good fruit (intended and deliberately produced) of the British occupation of India. And I assure them that I shall make the amplest amends if I find that I have erred in my eagerness about the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs.
U||TWO ENGLISHMEN REPLY
U||Dear Mr. Gandhi,
U||Thank you for your letter to every Englishman in India, with its hard-hitting and its generous tone. Something within us responds to the note which you have struck. We are not representatives of any corporate body, but we think that millions of our countrymen in England, and not a few in India, feel as we do. The reading of your letter convinces us that you and we cannot be real enemies.
U||May we say at once that in so far as the British Empire stands for the domination and exploitation of other races for Britain’s benefit, for degrading treatment of any, for traffic in intoxicating liquors, for repressive legislation, for administration such as that which to the Amritsar incidents, we desire the end of it as much as you do? We quite understand that in the excitement of the present crisis, owing to certain acts of the British Administration, which we join with you in condemning, the Empire presents itself to you under this aspect along. But from personal contact with our countrymen, we know that working like leaven in the midst of such tendencies, as you and we deplore, is the faith in a better ideal—the ideal of a commonwealth of free peoples voluntarily linked together by the ties of common experience in the past and common aspirations for the future, a commonwealth which may hope to spread liberty and progress through the whole earth. With vast numbers of our countrymen we value the Bri
U||tish Empire mainly as affording the possibility of the realization of such an idea and on the ground give it our loyal allegiance.
U||Meanwhile we do repent of that arrogant attitude to Indians which has been all too common among our countrymen, we do hold Indians to be our brothers and equals, many of them our superiors, and we would rather be servants than rulers of India. We desire an administration which cannot he intimated either by the selfish element in Anglo-Indian political opinion or by any other sectional interest and which shall govern in accordance with the best democratic principles. We should welcome the convening of a National assembly of recognized leaders of the people, representing all shades of political opinion of every caste, race and creed, to frame a constitution for Swaraj. In all the things that matter most we are with you. Surely you and we can co-operate in the service of India, in such matters for example as education. It seems to us nothing short of a tragedy that you should be rallying Indian Patriotism to inaugurate a new era of good will under a watchword that divides, instead of uniting all.
U||We have spoken of the large amount of common ground upon which you and we can stand. But frankness demands that we express our anxiety about some items in your programme. Leaving aside smaller questions on which your letter seems to us to do the British side less than justice, may we mention three main points? Your insistence on spiritual forces alone we deeply respect and desire to emulate, but we cannot understand your combining into it with a close alliance with those who, as you frankly say, would draw the sword as soon as they could.
U||Your desire for an education truly national commands our whole-hearted approval. But instead of Indianizing the present system, as you could begin to do from the beginning of next year, or instead of creating a hundred institutions such as that at Bolpur and turning into them the stream of India’s young intellectual life, you appear to be turning that stream out of its present channel into open sands where it may dry up. In other words, you seem to us to be risking the complete cessation, for a period possibly, of years, of all education, for a large number of boys and young men. Is it best, for those young men or for India that the present imperfect education should cease before a better education is ready to take its place?
U||Your desire to unite Mohammedan and Hindu and to share with your Mohammedan brethren in seeking the satisfaction of Mohammedan aspirations, we can understand and sympathize with. But is there no danger, in the course which some of your party have urged upon the Government, that certain races in the former Ottoman Empire might be fixed under a foreign yoke, for worse than that which you hold the English yoke to be? You could not wish to purchase freedom in India at the price of enslavement in the middle East.
U||To sum up, we thank you for the spirit of your letter, to which we have tried to respond in the same spirit. We are with you in the desire for an India genuinely free to develop the best that is in her and in the belief that best is something wonderful of which the world to-day stands in need.
U||We are ready to co-operate with you and with every other man of any race or nationality who will help India to realize her best. Are you going to insist that you can have nothing to do with us if we receive a government grant (i.e., Indian money), for an Indian School. Surely some more inspiring battle cry than non-co-operation can be discovered. We have ventured quite frankly to point out three items in your present programme, which seem to us likely to hinder the attainment of your true ideals for Indian greatness. But those ideals themselves command our warm sympathy, and we desire to work, so far as we have opportunity, for their attainment. In fact, it is only thus that we can interpret our British citizenship.
U||Yours sincerely, (Sd.) H.A. POPLEY, (Sd.) G.E. PHILLIPS. Bangalore, November 15, 1920.
U||RENUNCIATION OF MEDALS
U||Mr. Gandhi has addressed the following letter to the Viceroy:—
U||It is not without a pang that I return the Kaisar-i-Hind gold medal granted to me by your predecessor for my humanitarian work in South Africa, the Zulu war medal granted in South Africa for my services as officer in charge of the Indian volunteer ambulance corps in 1906 and the Boer war medal fur my services as assistant superintendent of the Indian volunteer stretcher bearer corps during the Boer war of 1899-1900. I venture to return these medals in pursuance of the scheme of non-co-operation inaugurated to-day in connection with the Khilafat movement. Valuable as those honours have been to me, I cannot wear them with an easy conscience so long as my Mussalman countrymen have to labour under a wrong done to their religious sentiment. Events that have happened during the past month have confirmed me in the opinion that the Imperial Government have acted in the Khilafat matter in an unscrupulous, immoral and unjust manner and have been moving from wrong to wrong in order to defend their immorality. I can ret
U||ain neither respect nor affection for such a Government.
U||The attitude of the Imperial and Your Excellency’s Governments on the Punjab question has given me additional cause for grave dissatisfaction. I had the honour, as Your Excellency is aware, as one of the congress commissioners to investigate the causes of the disorders in the Punjab during the April of 1919. And it is my deliberate conviction that Sir Michael O’Dwyer was totally unfit to hold the office of Lieutenant Governor of Punjab and that his policy was primarily responsible for infuriating the mob at Amritsar. No doubt the mob excesses were unpardonable; incendiarism, murder of five innocent Englishmen and the cowardly assault on Miss Sherwood were most deplorable and uncalled for. But the punitive measures taken by General Dyer, Col. Frank Johnson, Col. O’Brien, Mr. Bosworth Smith, Rai Shri Ram Sud, Mr. Malik Khan and other officers were out of all proportional to the crime of the people and amounted to wanton cruelty and inhumanity and almost unparalleled in modern times. Your excellency’s l
U||ight-hearted treatment of the official crime, your, exoneration of Sir Michael O’Dwyer, Mr. Montagu’s dispatch and above all the shameful ignorance of the Punjab events and callous disregard of the feelings of Indians betrayed by the House of Lords, have filled me with the gravest misgivings regarding the future of the Empire, have estranged me completely from the present Government and have disabled me from tendering, as I have hitherto whole-heartedly tendered, my loyal co-operation.
U||In my humble opinion the ordinary method of agitating by way of petitions, deputations and the like is no remedy for moving to repentence a Government so hopelessly indifferent to the welfare of its charges as the Government of India has proved to me. In European countries, condonation of such grievous wrongs as the Khilafat and the Punjab would have resulted in a bloody revolution by the people. They would have resisted at all costs national emasculation such as the said wrongs imply. But half of India is to weak to offer violent resistance and the other half is unwilling to do so.
U||I have therefore ventured to suggest the remedy of non-co-operation which enables those who wish, to dissociate themselves from the Government and which, if it is unattended by violence and undertaken in an ordered manner, must compel it to retrace its steps and undo the wrongs committed. But whilst I shall pursue the policy of non-co-operation in so far as I can carry the people with me, I shall not lose hope that you will yet see your way to do justice. I therefore respectfully ask Your Excellency to summon a conference of the recognised leaders of the people and in consultation with them find a way that would placate the Mussalmans and do reparation to the unhappy Punjab. August 4, 1920.
U||MAHATMA GANDHI’S LETTER TO H.R.H. THE DUKE OF CONNAUGHT
U||The following letter has been addressed by Mr. Gandhi to his Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught;—
U||Sir,
U||Your Royal Highness must have heard a great deal about non-co-operation, non-co-operationists and their methods and incidentally of me its humble author. I fear that the information given to Your Royal Highness must have been in its nature one-sided. I owe it to you and to my friends and myself that I should place before you what I conceive to be the scope of non-co-operation as followed not only be me but my closest associates such as Messrs. Shaukat Ali and Mahomed Ali.
U||For me it is no joy and pleasure to be actively associated in the boycott of your Royal Highness’ visit—I have tendered loyal and voluntary association to the Government for an unbroken period of nearly 30 years in the full belief that through that way lay the path of freedom for my country. It was therefore no slight thing for me to suggest to my countrymen that we should take no part in welcoming Your Royal Highness. Not one among us has anything against you as an English gentleman. We hold your person as sacred as that of a dearest friend. I do not know any of my friends who would not guard it with his life, if he found it in danger. We are not at war with individual Englishmen we seek not to destroy English life. We do desire to destroy a system that has emasculated our country in body, mind and soul. We are determined to battle with all our might against that in the English nature which has made O’Dwyerism and Dyerism possible in the Punjab and has resulted in a wanton affront upon Islam a faith p
U||rofessed by seven crores of our countrymen. The affront has been put in breach of the letter and the spirit of the solemn declaration of the Prime Minister. We consider it to be inconsistent with our self respect any longer to brook the spirit of superiority and dominance which has systematically ignored and disregarded the sentiments of thirty crores of the innocent people of India on many a vital matter. It is humiliating to us, it cannot be a matter of pride to you, that thirty crores of Indians should live day in and day out in the fear of their lives from one hundred thousand Englishmen and therefore be under subjection to them.
U||Your Royal Highness has come not to end the system I have described but to sustain it by upholding its prestige. Your first pronouncement was a laudation of Lord Wellingdon. I have the privilege of knowing him. I believe him to be an honest and amiable gentleman who will not willingly hurt even a fly. But, he has certainly failed as a ruler. He allowed himself to be guided by those whose interest it was to support their power. He is reading the mind of the Dravidian province. Here in Bengal you are issuing a certificate of merit to a Governor who is again from all I have heard an estimable gentleman. But he knows nothing of the heart of Bengal and its yearnings. Bengal is not Calcutta. Fort William and the palaces of Calcutta represent an insolent exploitation of the unmurmuring and highly cultured peasantry of this fair province. Non-co-operationists have come to the conclusion that they must not be deceived by the reforms that tinker with the problem of India’s distress and humiliation. Nor must they be 
U||impatient and angry. We must not in our impatient anger resort, to stupid violence. We freely admit that we must take our due share of the blame for the existing state. It is not so much the British guns that are responsible fur our subjection, as our voluntary co-operation. Our non-participation in a hearty welcome to your Royal Highness is thus in no sense a demonstration against your high personage but it is against the system you have come to uphold. I know that individual Englishmen cannot even if they will alter the English nature all of a sudden. If we would be equals of Englishmen we must cast off fear. We must learn to be self-reliant and independent of the schools, courts, protection, and patronage of a Government, we seek to end, if it will not mend. Hence this non-violent non-co-operation. I know that we have not all yet become non-violent in speech and deed. But the results so far achieved have I assure Your Royal Highness, been amazing. The people have understood the secret and the value of non
U||-violence as they have never done before. He who runs may see that this a religious, purifying movement. We are leaving off drink, we are trying to rid India of the curse of untouchability. We are trying to throw off foreign tinsel splendour and by reverting to the spinning wheel reviving the ancient and the poetic simplicity of life. We hope thereby to sterilize the existing harmful institution. I ask Your Royal Highness as an Englishman to study this movement and its possibilities for the Empire and the world. We are at war with nothing that is good in the world. In protecting Islam in the manner we are, we are protecting all religions. In protecting the honour of India we are protecting the honour of humanity. For our means are hurtful to none. We desire to live on terms of friendship with Englishmen but that friendship must be friendship of equals in both theory and practice. And we must continue to non-co-operate, i.e. to purify ourselves till the goal is achieved.
U||I ask Your Royal Highness and through you every Englishman to appreciate the view-point of the non-co-operationists.
U||I beg to remain, Your Royal Highness’s faithful servant, (Sd.) M.K. GANDHI. February, 1921
U||THE GREATEST THING
U||It is to be wished that non-co-operationists will clearly recognise that nothing can stop the onward march of the nation as violence. Ireland may gain its freedom by violence. Turkey may regain her lost possessions by violence within measurable distance of time. But India cannot win her freedom by violence for a century, because her people are not built in the manner of other nations. They have been nurtured in the traditions of suffering. Rightly or wrongly, for good or ill, Islam too has evolved along peaceful lines in India. And I make bold to say that, if the honour of Islam is to be vindicated through its followers in India, it will only be by methods of peaceful, silent, dignified, conscious, and courageous suffering. The more I study that wonderful faith, the more convinced I become that the glory of Islam is due not to the sword but to the sufferings, the renunciation, and the nobility of its early Caliphs. Islam decayed when its followers, mistaking the evil for the good, dangled the sword in the fa
U||ce of man, and lost sight of the godliness, the humility, and austerity of its founder and his disciples. But, I am not at the present moment, concerned with showing that the basis of Islam, as of all religions, is not violence but suffering not the taking of life but the giving of it.
U||What I am anxious to show is that non-co-operationists must be true as well to the spirit as to the letter of their vow if they would gain Swaraj within one year. They may forget non-co-operation but they dare not forget non-violence. Indeed, non-co-operation is non-violence. We are violent when we sustain a government whose creed is violence. It bases itself finally not on right but on might. Its last appeal is not to reason, nor the heart, but to the sword. We are tired of this creed and we have risen against it. Let us not ourselves belie our profession by being violent. Though the English are very few, they are organised for violence. Though we are many we cannot be organised for violence for a long time to come. Violence for us is a gospel or despair.
U||I have seen a pathetic letter from a god-fearing English woman who defends Dyerism for she thinks that, if General Dyer had not enacted Jallianwala, women and children would have been murdered by us. If we are such brutes as to desire the blood of innocent women and children, we deserve to be blotted out from the face of the earth. There is the other side. It did not strike this good lady that, if we were friends, the price that her countrymen paid at Jallianwala for buying their safety was too great. They gained their safety at the cost of their humanity. General Dyer has been haltingly blamed, and his evil genius Sir Michael O’Dwyer entirely exonerated because Englishmen do not want to leave this country of fields even if everyone of us has to be killed. If we go mad again as we did at Amritsar, let there be no mistake that a blacker Jallianwala will be enacted.
U||Shall we copy Dyerism and O’Dwyerism even whilst we are condemning it? Let not our rock be violence and devilry. Our rock must be non-violence and godliness. Let us, workers, be clear as to what we are about. Swaraj depends upon our ability to control all the forces of violence on our side. Therefore there is no Swaraj within one year, if there is violence on the part of the people.
U||We must then refrain from sitting dhurna, we must refrain from crying ‘shame, shame’ to anybody, we must not use any coercion to persuade our people to adopt our way. We must guarantee to them the same freedom we claim for ourselves. We must not tamper with the masses. It is dangerous to make political use of factory labourers or the peasantry—not that we are not entitled to do so, but we are not ready for it. We have neglected their political (as distinguished from literary) education all these long years. We have not got enough honest, intelligent, reliable, and brave workers to enable us to act upon these countrymen of ours.
U||IX. MAHATMA GANDHI’S STATEMENT
U||[The following is the Statement of Mahatma Gandhi made before the Court during his Trial in Ahmedabad on the 18th March 1921.]
U||Before reading his written statement Mahatma Gandhi spoke a few words as introductory remarks to the whole statement. He said: Before I read this statement, I would like to state that I entirely endorse the learned Advocate-General’s remarks in connection with my humble self. I think that he was entirely fair to me in all the statements that he has made, because it is very true and I have no desire whatsoever to conceal from this Court the fact that to preach disaffection towards the existing system of Government has become almost a passion with me. And the learned Advocate-General is also entirely in the right when he says that my preaching of disaffection did not commence with my connection with “Young India” but that it commenced much earlier and in the statement that I am about to read it will be my painful duty to admit before this Court that it commenced much earlier than the period stated by the Advocate-General. It is the most painful duty with me but I have to discharge that duty knowing the r
U||esponsibility that rested upon my shoulders. And I wish to endorse all the blame that the Advocate-General has thrown on my shoulders in connection with the Bombay occurrence, Madras occurrences, and the Chouri Choura occurrences thinking over these things deeply, and sleeping over them night after night and examining my heart I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible for me to dissociate myself from the diabolical crimes of Chouri Choura or the mad outrages of Bombay. He is quite right when he says that as a man of responsibility, a man having received a fair share of education, having had a fair share of experience of this world, I should know them. I knew that I was playing with fire. I ran the risk and if I was set free I would still do the same. I would be failing in my duty if I do not do so. I have felt it this morning that I would have failed in my duty if I did not say all what I said here just now. I wanted to avoid violence. Non-violence is the first article of my faith. It is the last a
U||rticle of my faith. But I had to make my choice. I had either to submit to a system which I considered has done an irreparable harm to my country or incur the risk of the mad fury of my people bursting forth when they understood the truth from my lips. I know that my people have sometimes gone mad. I am deeply sorry for it; and I am, therefore, here to submit not to a light penalty but to the highest penalty. I do not ask for mercy. I do not plead any extenuating act. I am here, therefore, to invite and submit to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen. The only course open to you, Mr. Judge, is, as I am just going to say in my statement, either to resign your post or inflict on me the severest penalty if you believe that the system and law you are assisting to administer are good for the people. I do not expect that kind of conversion. But by the time I have finished with my statement you will, perhaps
U||, have a glimpse of what is raging within my breast to run this maddest risk which a sane man can run.
U||WRITTEN STATEMENT
U||I owe it perhaps to the Indian public and to the public in England to placate which this prosecution is mainly taken up that I should explain why from a staunch loyalist and co-operator I have become an uncompromising disaffectionist and non-co-operator. To the Court too I should say why I plead guilty to the charge of promoting disaffection towards the Government established by law in India. My public life began in 1893 in South Africa in troubled weather. My first contact with British authority in that country was not of a happy character. I discovered that as a man and as an Indian I had no rights. On the contrary I discovered that I had no rights as a man because I was an Indian.
U||But I was not baffled. I thought that this treatment of Indians was an excrescence upon a system that was intrinsically and mainly good. I gave the Government my voluntary and hearty co-operation, criticising it fully where I felt it was faulty but never wishing its destruction.
U||Consequently when the existence of the Empire was threatened in 1899 by the Boer challenge, I offered my services to it, raised a volunteer ambulance corps and served at several actions that took place for the relief of Ladysmith. Similarly in 1906 at the time of the Zulu revolt I raised a stretcher-bearer party and served till the end of the ‘rebellion’. On both these occasions I received medals and was even mentioned in despatches. For my work in South Africa I was given by Lord Hardinge a Kaiser-i-Hind Gold Medal. When the war broke out in 1914 between England and Germany I raised a volunteer ambulance corps in London consisting of the then resident Indians in London, chiefly students. Its work was acknowledged by the authorities to be valuable. Lastly in India when a special appeal was made at the War Conference in Delhi in 1917 by Lord Chelmsford for recruits, I struggled at the cost of my health to raise a corps in Kheda and the response was being made when the hostilities ceased and orders were re
U||ceived that no more recruits were wanted. In all those efforts at service I was actuated by the belief that it was possible by such services to gain a status of full equality in the Empire for my countrymen.
U||The first shock came in the shape of the Rowlalt Act a law designed to rob the people of all real freedom. I felt called upon to lead an intensive agitation against it. Then followed the Punjab horrors beginning with the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh and culminating in brawling orders, public floggings and other indescribable humiliations, I discovered too that the plighted word of the Prime Minister to the Mussalmans of India regarding the integrity of Turkey and the holy places of Islam was not likely to be fulfilled. But in spite of the foreboding and the grave warnings of friends, at the Amritsar Congress in 1919 I fought for co-operation and working the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, hoping that the Prime Minister would redeem his promise to the Indian Mussalmans, that the Punjab wound would be healed and that the reforms inadequate and unsatisfactory though they were, marked a new era of hope in the life of India. But all that hope was shattered. The Khilafat promise was not to be redeemed. The Punjab crim
U||e was white-washed and most culprits went not only unpunished but remained in service and some continued to draw pensions from the Indian revenue, and in some cases were even rewarded. I saw too that not only did the reforms not mark a change of heart, but they were only a method of further draining India of her wealth and of prolonging her servitude.
U||I came reluctantly to the conclusion that the British connection had made India more helpless than she ever was before, politically and economically. A disarmed India has no power of resistance against any aggressor if she wanted to engage in an armed conflict with him. So much is this the case that some of our best men consider that India must take generations before she can achieve the Dominion status. She has become so poor that she has little power of resisting famines. Before the British advent India spun and wove in her millions of cottages just the supplement she needed for adding to her meagre agricultural resources. The cottage industry, so vital for India’s existence, has been ruined by incredibly heartless and inhuman processes as described by English witnesses. Little do town-dwellers know how the semi-starved masses of Indians are slowly sinking to lifelessness. Little do they know that their miserable comfort represents the brokerage they get for the work they do for the foreign exploiter, th
U||at the profits and the brokerage are sucked from the masses. Little do they realise that the Government established by law in British India is carried on for this exploitation of the masses. No sophistry, no jugglery in figures can explain away the evidence the skeletons in many villages present to the naked eye. I have no doubt whatsoever that both England and the town dwellers of India will have to answer, if there is a God above, for this crime against humanity which is perhaps unequalled in history. The law itself in this country has been used to serve the foreign exploiter. My unbiased, examination of the Punjab Martial Law cases had led me to believe that at least ninety-five per cent. of convictions were wholly bad. My experience of political cases in India leads me to the conclusion that in nine out of every ten the condemned men were totally innocent. Their crime consisted in love of their country. In ninety-nine cases out of hundred justice has been denied to Indians as against Europeans in the Cou
U||rt of India. This is not an exaggerated picture. It is the experience of almost every Indian who has had anything to do such cases. In my opinion the administration of the law is thus prostituted consciously or unconsciously for the benefit of the exploiter. The greatest misfortune is that Englishmen and their Indian associates in the administration of the country do not know that they are engaged in the crime I have attempted to describe. I am satisfied that many English and Indian officials honestly believe that they are administering one of the best systems devised in the world and that India is making steady though slow progress. They do not know that a subtle but effective system of terrorism and an organised display of force on the one hand and the deprivation of all powers of retaliation of self-defence on the other have emasculated the people and induced in them the habit of simulation. This awful habit has added to the ignorance and the self-deception of the administrators. Section 124-A under which
U|| I am happily charged is perhaps the prince among the political sections of the Indian Penal Code designed to suppress the liberty of the citizen. Affection cannot be manufactured or regulated by law. If one has no affection for a person or thing one should be free to give the fullest expression to his disaffection so long as he does not contemplate, promote or incite to violence. But the section under which mere promotion of disaffection is a crime. I have studied some of the cases tried under it, and I know that some of the most loved of India’s patriots have been convicted under it. I consider it a privilege therefore, to be charged under it. I have endeavoured to give in their briefest outline the reasons for my disaffection. I have no personal ill-will against any single administrator, much less can I have any disaffection towards the King’s person. But I hold it to be a virtue to be disaffected towards a Government which in its totality has done more harm to India than any previous system. India is
U|| less manly under the British rule than she ever was before. Holding such a belief, I consider it to be a sin to have affection for the system. And it has been a precious privilege for me to be able to write what I have in the various articles tendered in evidence against me.
U||In fact I believe that I have rendered a service to India and England by showing in non-co-operation the way out of the unnatural state in which both are living. In my humble opinion, non-co-operation with evil is as much a duty as is co-operation with good. But in the past, non-co-operation has been deliberately expressed in violence to the evil doer. I am endeavouring to show to my countrymen that violent non-co-operation only multiplies evil and that as evil can only be sustained by violence, withdrawal of support of evil requires complete abstention from violence. Non-violent implies voluntary submission to the penalty for non-co-operation with evil. I am here, therefore, to invite and submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can he inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen. The only course open to you, the Judge and the Assessors, is either to resign your posts and thus dissociate yourselves from evil if you feel that the law 
U||you are called upon to administer is an evil and that in reality I am innocent, or to inflict on me the severest penalty if you believe that the system and the law you are assisting to administer are good for the people of this country and that my activity is therefore injurious to the public weal.

U||Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
U||Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
U||The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
U||While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
U||International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
U||Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
U||Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
U||Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
U||Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
U||Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.
U||This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

U||PREFACE
U||The struggle for Indian Home Rule which was started with the inauguration of the Indian National Congress has many difficulties to encounter, has strong and powerful opponents and has received many checks. But its strongest opponent is Mr. Gandhi and perhaps the most severe check it has received is the adoption by the National Congress at his instance in Calcutta and Nagpur of the so-called-Non-violent Non-co-operation. Non-co-operation as advocated by Mr. Gandhi may be a weapon to be used when constitutional methods have failed to achieve our purpose. Non-violence and passive suffering will lead to bloodshed or be unfruitful of any satisfactory results. Moreover, nothing shows the lack of statesmanship more than practically basing the claim for Swaraj upon the Punjab and the Khilafat grievances. As representing Asia against Europe, the fair {x} against the white race, the Hindus regarded the Turkish Empire with sympathy and were disposed to support the Mahomadens as Asiatic representatives. But when by Gand
U||hi and Khilafatist that claim was abandoned; when the Arabs perhaps the noblest of the Mahomadan races who fought as our allies and helped us to defeat Turkey were sought to be brought under Turkish dominion, when other Asiatic races freed by the war were asked to accept Turkish sovereignty on grounds based on the Mahomaden religion which had already produced such baneful result in India, the situation became entirely different. It was rightly realised by many, and the sequel has proved that they were right, that the path of the progress of the Gandhi movement fused with the Khilafat element will be bloody. The claim for Indian Home Rule rests upon very different grounds. The Hindus have nothing to do with the Khilafat agitation. The Mahomadans themselves are not agreed as to the claims advanced on behalf of the Calif. It is even questionable, to put it mildly, whether that claim has the support of the majority of the Mahomadans. While the claim itself rested on such slender grounds, the means first adopted 
U||{xi} to enforce the claim were grotesque. The methods advocated by Mr. Gandhi and the Congress are directed against Western civilization; against the class which fought for and won the reforms; and the Montague reforms scheme of constitutional progress. They have failed miserably and as was natural more violent methods leading to direct conflict with the forces of Government have been advocated which would in all probability have been carried out but for the arrest and imprisonment of Mr. Gandhi. He belongs to a class of thought which has attracted some of the noblest minds in this world, but in applying his the gospel of life to politics, he has shown himself a babe and his interference has been generally mischievous. In South Africa he is responsible for creating a situation which makes a peaceful and satisfactory solution practically impossible. His factious policy in India stands in the way of further reforms. The opposition to Gandhi was however not strenuous. The so-called Moderates only whispered thei
U||r protests against his policy so as not to be heard beyond a few feet. They are loud however, in their denunciation of Government action to check the illegal activities of Mr. {xii} Gandhi and his followers. It can hardly be doubted that their cautious attitude has contributed to the growth of the Gandhi movement. But the inexplicable conduct of a certain—I won't say class—body of gentlemen has still more contributed to that result.
U||There is scarcely any item in the Gandhi programme which is not a complete violation of everything preached by the foremost sons of India till 1919; which has not been strongly even vehemently denounced by those old respected members of the Congress who now follow Mr. Gandhi, Pandit Malaviya, Messrs. Vijayaragavachari, Lajapat Rai, Natarajam, S. Kasturiranga Iyengar, the Editor of the 'Hindu.' Mr. Gandhi's emotional outbursts, fastings, penances, Sanyasi waist cloth, may carry away the emotional masses, women and students. But whether this wave of emotionalism submerged the men abovenamed I would not care to guess. No one of course has any right to find fault with his genuine followers like Mr. Prakasam, Editor, 'Swaraj' whose motives, however much we might differ from his politics, no one will question. He is one of those genuine patriots who believes in the efficacy of Mr. Gandhi's methods to obtain {xiii} Home Rule. By far the great majority however, follow him for other reasons.
U||The severe simplicity and austerity of Mr. Gandhi's life combined with his appeal to the principle of 'Ahimsa' non-injury inherited from Buddists and now ingrained in Hindu life, has secured him the support of the Hindu masses and particularly vegetarians. His support of the caste system has won over the higher classes and the reactionary elements of Hindu society to his side. The caste system is entirely opposed to the 'Ahimsa' (Non-injury) principle. The former has dedicated one of the main castes to death. Its function is to kill and be killed. It is also the function of some of the sub-castes of the lowest caste or class to slaughter animals. His indiscriminating support of the extreme Khilafat demands has ensured the Mahomedan support. Islam is more opposed than the caste system to "Ahimsa." The trouble with the Hindus over the slaughter of cows is due to this difficulty. Some politicians who naturally desire to use him and the influence he has acquired for putting pressure on the Government to concede 
U||further reform, also have joined him. But I am satisfied he is using them all to further his own ends. An attempt {xiv} in which he is bound to fail. His success i.e. the success of the reactionary forces in India to obtain what they call Dominion status or Home Rule, but, which really means their rule, will not only lead to bloodshed and anarchy and the dismemberment of the Empire; but to the triumph of a reactionary policy, social, moral and economic, against which the democratic policy of the recent reforms and the Legislative Councils is an emphatic protest. I have attempted in the following pages to give my reasons for these conclusions.
U||Far more important than my narrative are the extracts published in the appendix. They consist of speeches made by the Viceroy, and members of Government in the Legislative Councils. I have on account of considerations of space omitted speeches in many provinces. I have not given any speech in full for the same reason. I have also given a list of riots or disturbances. These give a fair idea of the activities of Mr. Gandhi.

U||GANDHI AND ANARCHY
U||HIS PHILOSOPHY
U||All of us are now striving for "Swaraj" or Home Rule. We wish to be masters of our own destiny. We want sooner or later the representatives of the people of the country to govern it. There are some amongst us who consider that Home Rule, is an immediate necessity. Others believe that Home Rule, at present without the fulfilment of certain preliminary conditions would be attended with disastrous results. But all are agreed that we should work for it. The practical difficulties in the way of its attainment due, partly to the relations between the various communities in India, partly to the opposition of powerful interests and the period that must therefore elapse before we overcome them render the discussion {2} of time, ignoring or brushing aside those difficulties, only of academic interest. Mr. Gandhi's great influence is due to the popular belief in the efficacy of his leadership to attain immediate Home Rule. To me his Non-Co-operation Campaign appears to be an egregious blunder for which we are already p
U||aying dearly. A long line of illustrious statesmen, Indian and English have just succeeded in leading us out of the house of bondage. How long we shall have to wander in the deserts we do not know. But it is certain that Mr. Gandhi is not leading his followers in the direction of the promised land. He is not only going in the opposite direction but instead of toughening our fibre by a life of toil and struggle is endeavouring to entirely emasculate us and render us altogether unfit for the glorious destiny that, but for him and others like him, is awaiting us.
U||This will be clear once the nature of his agitation is realised. For that purpose, it is necessary to understand his mentality and his real views on the problems of life and the various questions now in debate.
U||These are given in various books which have been published and in his paper "Young {3} India", edited by him. His "Indian Home Rule", was first published in 1908. In a publication of 1921, he says "I withdraw nothing except one word of it and that in deference to a lady friend." The reason is the indelicacy of the expression....
U||The book is in the form of a dialogue between a Reader and the "Editor" the latter being Gandhi himself.
U||Mr. Gandhi wishes to know the necessity of driving away the English,
U||Reader:—"Because India has become impoverished by their Government. They take away our money from year to year. The most important posts are reserved for themselves. We are kept in a state of slavery. They behave insolently towards us, and disregard our feelings."
U||Gandhi:—"Supposing we get Self-government similar to what the Canadians and South Africans have, will it be good enough?"
U||Reader:—"That question also is useless. We may get it when we have the same powers. We shall then hoist our own flag. As is Japan so must India be. We must own our navy, our army, and we must have our own splendour. Then will India's voice ring throughout the world."
U||Gandhi:—"You have well drawn the picture. In effect it means this: that we want English Rule without the Englishman. You want the tiger's nature but not the {4} tiger; that is to say you would make India English and when it becomes English, it will be called not Hindustan but Englistan. This is not the Swaraj that I want."
U||Nothing can be clearer. He does not want the dominion status of Canada or South Africa for India. He does not claim the independence of Japan for India as he points out a few lines below, "What you call swaraj is not truly swaraj."
U||What is then the real "Swaraj" according to Mr. Gandhi? He proceeds to develop his views by illustrations.
U||He gives his views on the poverty of India. He says Railways, Lawyers and Doctors have impoverished the country, so much so that, if we do not wake up in time, we shall be ruined.
U||About railways he says as follows:—
U||"Man is so made by nature as to require him to restrict his movements as far as his hands and feet will take him. If we did not rush about from place to place by means of railways and such other maddening conveniences, much of the confusion that arises, would be obviated. Our difficulties are of our own creation. God set a limit to a man's locomotive ambition in the construction of his body. Man immediately proceeded to discover means of overriding the limit. God gifted man with intellect that he might know his Maker. Man abused it so that he might forget his Maker. I am so {5} constructed that I can only serve my immediate neighbours, but in my conceit, I pretend to have discovered that I must with my body serve every individual in the Universe. In thus attempting the impossible, man comes in contact with different religions and is utterly confounded. According to this reasoning, it must be apparent to you that railways are a most dangerous institution. Man has gone further away from his Maker".
U||And he advises all his friends to go into the interior of the country that has yet not been polluted by the railways and live there in order to be patriotic.
U||I shall not insult the intelligence of my reader by attempting a defence of the railways which have knit India together. I will only observe that according to Mr. Gandhi, the construction and use of railways for locomotion not possible for man in his natural condition, is an abuse of God's gift. And why? Because if he comes into contact with different natures, with different religions he might try to serve others than his neighbour whom alone God intended him to serve!!!
U||As to lawyers, he will have none of them; without lawyers, courts could not have been established or conducted and without them the British could not hold India. He has yet to {6} learn that there were courts both in pre-British India and British India before lawyers. He thinks the Hindu-Mahomedan quarrels have often been due to the intervention of lawyers. He wants all people to settle their own quarrels; "men were less unmanly if they settled their disputes either by fighting or by asking their relatives to decide them. They became more unmanly and cowardly when they resorted to the Courts of Law. It is a sign of savagery to settle disputes by fighting. It is not the less so by asking a third party to decide between you and me. The parties alone know who is right and therefore they ought to settle it". Such is his opinion of lawyers and of Courts.
U||He is even more harsh on doctors. His opinion is quoted below as any statement of it in my own words might be regarded as travesty:—
U||"Let us consider; the business of a doctor is to take care of the body, or, properly speaking, not even that. Their business is really to rid the body of diseases that may afflict. How do these diseases arise? Surely by our negligence or indulgence. I overeat, I have indigestion, I go to a doctor, he gives me medicine. I am cured, I overeat again, and I take his pills again. Had I not taken the pills in the first {7} instance, I would have suffered the punishment deserved by me, and I would not have over-eaten again. The doctor intervened and helped me to indulge myself. My body thereby certainly felt more at ease, but my mind became weakened. A continuance of a course of medicine must, therefore, result in loss of a control over the mind.
U||"I have indulged in vice, I contract a disease, a doctor cures me, the odds are that I shall repeat the vice. Had the doctor not intervened, nature would have done its work, and I would have acquired mastery over myself, would have been freed from vice, and would have become happy.
U||"Hospitals are institutions for propagating sin. Men take less care of their bodies, and immorality increases".
U||He says therefore that a doctor should "give up medicine, and understand that rather than mending bodies, he should mend souls", and he must also understand that "if, by not taking drugs, perchance the patient dies, the world will not come to grief and he will have been really useful to him".
U||There is no use in arguing with him and his dupes on this subject after this. But his views must be borne in mind when we come to deal with the present agitation.
U||About education, his views are equally remarkable. If, he says, education simply means knowledge of letters it is merely an {8} instrument and an instrument may be well used or abused. He adds:—
U||"We daily observe that many men abuse it and very few make good use of it".
U||He will not give any education to a raiyat or poor peasant:—
U||"The ordinary meaning of education is a knowledge of letters. To teach boys reading, writing and arithmetic is called primary education".
U||"What do you propose to do by giving him a knowledge of letters? Will you add an inch to his happiness? Do you wish to make him discontented with his cottage or his lot?"
U||So much for primary education. As to higher education he says he has learnt Geography, Astronomy, Algebra, Geometry etc., but neither has that learning benefited him nor any body about him. As to knowledge of English, it is only useful to enslave people:—
U||"The foundation that Macaulay laid of education", he says: "has enslaved us. It is worth noting that by receiving English education, we have enslaved the nation. Hypocrisy, tyranny etc. have increased; English-knowing Indians have not hesitated to cheat and strike terror into the people. Now, if we are doing anything for the people at all, we are paying only a portion of the debt due to them".
U||I shall have to deal with this question of {9} education later in connection with this appeal to the boys to leave the schools and colleges.
U||After all this, it will not surprise any one to be told that we must have nothing to do with machinery:—
U||"It was not that we did not know how to invent machinery, but our forefathers knew that, if we set our hearts after such things, we would become slaves and lose our moral fibre. They, therefore, after due deliberation, decided that we should only do what we could with our hands and feet. They saw that our real happiness and health consisted in a proper use of our hands and feet."
U||He would not therefore have mills for the reason that machinery is the chief symbol of modern civilisation and it has already begun to desolate Europe. In his opinion it were better for us to send money to Manchester and to use flimsy Manchester cloth than to multiply mills in India. I wonder why he does not ask Lancashire to pay him his crore of rupees. Lancashire would no doubt do so in consideration of the monopoly of supplying India with manufactured goods and India would, according to Mr. Gandhi, get Swaraj. India does not want manufactured goods; he asks:—
U||{10} "What did India do before these articles were introduced? Precisely the same should be done to-day. As long as we cannot make pins without machinery, so long will we do without them. The tinsel splendour of glassware we will have nothing to do with, and we will make wick, as of old, with home grown cotton, and use hand-made earthen saucers for Lamps". He finally adds: "I cannot recall a single good point in connection with machinery."
U||Mr. Gandhi wrote his book in 1908 after a visit to England when the Liberal and the Labour parties were carrying on their great campaign in favour of the working men and against the capitalists and Lloyd George was about to launch his great land campaign. He seems to have been impressed with the horrors of the condition of the wage earners which was then portrayed in dark colours in order to support that campaign. His mind, emotional and ill balanced, seems to have been entirely upset by the descriptions that he had then read. He is on the fringe of a large question about which he seems to have been singularly ill informed. In England there is not at this time and there was not when he wrote, any question of the destruction of machinery which is a necessary adjunct to the industrial system. {11} The questions under debate are the conditions of labour and the distribution of the wealth created by machinery between capitalists and labour. These questions have been under consideration now for some years; the co
U||ndition of the labourers is being slowly improved, a minimum wage has been introduced and there is a prospect of a still more equitable distribution of the proceeds between capital and labour. Mr. Gandhi says that he has read Dutt's book on the decline of Indian industries but he does not seem to have learnt the lesson inculcated therein—that it is necessary to improve our industries not only to meet the needs of the people of the country, find employment for our labouring population, but also not to force them to compete with the cultivating classes. In India the same problem as in England awaits us. We have to see that the condition of the labourers in the mills and in the other industries is improved. In asking for the ruin of all our manufacturing industries Mr. Gandhi is only playing into the hands of our opponents. He will find strong support in this respect from Lancashire who will, according to some Indian {12} publicists, only be too willing to take any steps to effect the destruction of our compe
U||ting industries. If he had directed half the energy of his non-co-operation campaign to improving the conditions of the workmen in all our industries he might possibly have succeeded in getting rid of many of those evils which in his opinion require elimination of all machinery and of all industrial undertakings. The other reason for the deplorable condition of the industrial workmen in England is the congestion and overcrowding, in the industrial centres. This is due to a great extent to the action of the landlords who will not allow any expansion of those industrial centres in order to increase the value of their land and thus to exploit the community. In India we have not got that trouble. There is ample room for extension except in Bombay, in all the industrial centres and even in Bombay the difficulty is not due, so far as I am informed to the action of landlords but to natural conditions arising out of the geography of Bombay. Machinery is essential to the creation of wealth by manufacturing industries
U||. The evils that have been portrayed by Mr. Gandhi can be and are being removed {13} by patient effort. His tirade against machinery and mill industries on account of the evils he has witnessed in the West, is due to his ignorance; a little knowledge in his case has proved a dangerous thing. It is this feeling which has led him to advocate the universal use of spinning wheel in India. This might be useful as a cottage or home industry. It might find work for some who would otherwise be idle. But he is living in a fool's paradise if he considers it a substitute for or will supplant, machinery.
U||It is unnecessary to say that he hates Parliaments:—
U||"The condition of England at present is pitiable. I pray to God that India may never be in that plight. That which you consider to be Mother of Parliaments is like a sterile woman and a prostitute. Both these are harsh terms, but exactly fit the case. That Parliament has not yet of its own accord done a single good thing; hence I have compared it to a sterile woman. The natural condition of that Parliament is such that without out-side pressure it can do nothing. It is like a prostitute because it is under the control of ministers who change from time to time. To-day it is under Mr. Asquith; tomorrow it may be under Mr. Balfour."
U||"If the money and the time wasted by Parliament were entrusted to a few good men, the English nation would be occupying to-day a much higher platform. {14} The Parliament is simply a costly toy of the nation. These views are by no means peculiar to me. Some great English thinkers have expressed them.
U||"That you cannot accept my views at once is only right. If you will read the literature on this subject, you will have some idea of it. The Parliament is without a real master, under the Prime Minister, its movement is not steady, but it is buffeted about like a prostitute. The Prime Minister is more concerned about his power than about the welfare of the Parliament. His energy is concentrated upon securing the success of his party. His care is not always that the Parliament shall do right. Prime Ministers are known to have made the Parliament do things merely for party advantage. All this is worth thinking over."
U||It is no wonder that he called upon all his followers to boycott the Indian Councils. I shall deal with this when dealing with the boycott question.
U||After all this one would naturally think that if we expel the English from India we would be happy. Not a bit, says Mr. Gandhi whose views about independence are peculiar. Look, he says, at Italy. He thinks that Italy has not gained anything by independence of Austrian domination. He adds:—
U||"If you believe that because Italians hold Italy, the Italian nation is happy, you are groping in darkness. What substantial gain did Italy obtain after the withdrawal {15} of the Austrian troops? The gain is only nominal. You do not want therefore to reproduce the same conditions in India. India to gain her independence can fight like Italy only when she has arms and in order to gain her independence India has to be armed and to arm India on a large scale is to Europeanise it. Then her condition will be just as pitiable as that of Europe. This means in short, that India must accept European civilisation ... but the fact is that the Indian nation will not adopt arms and it is well that she does not."
U||She must not therefore use force to fight the English.
U||But what is it she has to do. She must obtain Swaraj or Home Rule by 'soul force'. What is it?:—
U||"When we are slaves we think that the whole universe is enslaved. Because we are in an abject condition, we think that the whole of India is in that condition. As a matter of fact, it is not so, but it is as well to impute our slavery to the whole of India. But if we bear in mind the above fact we can see that if we become free, India is free. And in this thought you have definition of 'swaraj.' It is 'swaraj' when we earn to rule ourselves. It is therefore in the palm of our hands. Do not consider this 'swaraj' to be like a dream. Hence there is no idea of sitting still. The 'swaraj' that I wish to picture before you and me is such that, after we have once realised it, we will endeavour to the end of our lifetime to persuade others to do likewise. But {16} such 'swaraj' has to be experienced by each one for himself."
U||The assumption made by a few persons that Mr. Gandhi is only condemning parliamentary government for its inutility is unfounded. The extracts already given might lend some colour to that view. But such is not the fact. In England Parliamentary government is denounced by certain persons on the ground that it will always be under the influence of a capitalist Press and therefore unable to redress the evils from which the people of the country other than the capitalists are suffering. Mr. Gandhi's objection is not based on any such ground; he is against not only Parliamentary Government but practically against any Government in any form as is apparent from the extracts given above. The doctrine that Governments have very little to do with our happiness which depends upon self-control or 'soul force' has many advocates, but to deduce it as a doctrine from the alleged failure of Parliamentary Government in England is ludicrous. I shall not stop here to justify Parliamentary government which has justified itself b
U||y its results; it is only ignorance of the {17} work that has been done which is responsible for opinions like those to which Mr. Gandhi has given expression.
U||Towards the end of the book he says:—
U||Before I leave you, I will take the liberty of repeating:—
U||1. Real Home Rule is Self Rule or control;
U||2. The way to it is Passive Resistance; that is soul force or love force.
U||In my opinion, we have used the term "Swaraj" without understanding its real significance. I have endeavoured to explain it as I understand it, and my conscience testifies that my life henceforth is dedicated to its attainment.
U||Such is the real Gandhi. Railways, lawyers, courts, doctors, education on Western lines, machinery of every kind or manufacturing industries, parliamentary government should disappear. He is singularly ill informed on every one of the questions he has discussed. 'Soul force' alone should be relied upon. No resistance should be offered to violence. No resistance should be offered to robbery and the robbers are to be left to cut one another's throats. No resistance to be offered to murderers or to those who might want to enslave you. Briefly, no protection {18} is to be given by laws and their administrators to person and property.
U||There is no harm perhaps as long as such fantastic visionaries restrict the application of these principles to themselves, to their own persons or properties. But it becomes a serious matter when their general application is sought for.
U||These are the sentiments he expressed in 1908, and it was with these sentiments that he came to India. As it is well to be definite and clear, I will quote from a letter addressed by him in 1909 to a friend in India:—
U||"Bombay, Calcutta and the other chief cities of India are the real plague spots".
U||"If British rule were replaced tomorrow by Indian rule based on modern methods, India would be no better, except that she would be able then to retain some of the money that is drained away to England; but then India would only become a second or fifth nation of Europe or America".
U||"Medical science is the concentrated essence of black magic. Quackery is infinitely preferable to what passes for high medical skill".
U||"Hospitals are the instruments that the devil has been using for his own purpose, in order to keep his hold on his kingdom. They perpetuate vice, misery and degradation and real slavery".
U||{19} "India's salvation consists in unlearning what she has learnt during the past fifty years. The railways, telegraphs, hospitals, lawyers, doctors, and such like have all to go, and so called upper classes have to learn to live consciously and religiously and deliberately the simple peasant life, knowing it to be a life giving true happiness".
U||But he soon found that it was hopeless to carry out his theories in the face of the determination of the people of India to attain Home Rule preached by the Indian National Congress and the Indian politicians. He had accordingly to put on a new garb. Therefore, in 1917, the year of the famous declaration made by the British Government about the progressive realisation of self government, he found it necessary, to obtain a hearing, to accept the Home Rule programme. In his Presidential address at the First Gujarat Political Conference in 1917 he said that without going into the merits of the scheme of reforms approved by the Congress and the Muslim League he will do all that is necessary to get it accepted and enforced. Though the scheme itself is not 'swaraj', he admitted it was a great step towards 'swaraj'. At the same time he said that though he is acting on the propriety of the current trend of {20} thought it does not appear to him to be tending altogether in the right direction as the 'swaraj' put forw
U||ard is one of Western type. Nevertheless as India is being governed in accordance with the Western system and without Parliament we should be nowhere, he does not hesitate to take part in the Parliamentary swaraj movement and the programme that he sketched out for himself may be described thus in his own words written in 1921:—
U||"But I would warn the reader against thinking that I am to-day aiming at the Swaraj therein (spiritual swaraj as described in his 'Indian Home Rule'), I know that India is not ripe for it. It may seem an impertinence to say so. But such is my conviction. I am individually working for the self-rule pictured therein. But to-day my corporate activity is undoubtedly devoted to the attainment of Parliamentary Swaraj in accordance with the wishes of the people of India. I am not aiming at destroying railways or hospitals, though I would certainly welcome their natural destruction. Neither railways nor hospitals are a test of a high and pure civilisation. At best they are a necessary evil. Neither adds one inch to the moral stature of a nation. Nor am I aiming at a permanent destruction of law courts, much as I regard it as 'a consummation devoutly to be wished for,' still less am I trying to destroy all machinery and mills. It requires a higher simplicity and renunciation than the people are to-day prepared for".
U||{21} He also admitted that his acceptance of Parliamentary Swaraj required some modification of his theory of using violence or force. He admitted that though there is no scope for violence or force in spiritual swaraj, and military training is intended only for those who do not believe in it, he was prepared to accept the view that the whole of India will never accept Satyagraha. He added:—
U||"Not to defend the weak is an entirely effeminate idea, everywhere to be rejected. In order to protect our innocent sister from the brutal designs of a man we ought to offer ourselves a willing sacrifice and by the force of Love conquer the brute in the man. But if we have not attained that power, we would certainly use up all our bodily strength in order to frustrate those designs. The votaries of soul force and brute force are both soldiers. The latter, bereft of his arms, acknowledges defeat, the former does not know what defeat is".
U||It was a consequence of this acceptance of Parliamentary Swaraj that he should try to work the Montagu Chelmsford Council reforms. Though these reforms may be inadequate yet for one who accepts the goal of Parliamentary Government it was his bounden duty to avail himself of the available Parliamentary scheme to carry out those reforms which were then {22} possible and to take the necessary steps to enlarge the scope of the scheme to carry out the further reforms that might be needed. Accordingly at the Amritsar Congress in December 1919, he resolved to co-operate with the country in working the Reform Scheme.
U||I have already pointed out that he entirely disagreed with the system of Parliamentary government and his acceptance was one of necessity. At the earliest opportunity at the special sessions of the Indian National Congress held at Calcutta in September 1920 and at the National Congress held at Nagpur in December 1920 he took steps to destroy the Montagu Reform Scheme of Parliamentary Swaraj and everything else to which he had given a reluctant assent and to bring the country to adopt his wild theories already stated by me and in order to do so, he brought into prominence forces entirely opposed to his own principles which he proved himself unable to control with disastrous consequences and had to resort willingly or unwillingly to dishonest methods.
U||What was the reason for his throwing overboard the Montagu Reform Scheme? The following resolution which at his insistence was {23} passed by the National Congress at Calcutta and practically re-affirmed at Nagpur will explain the situation as then developed.
U||{24}
U||THE NON-CO-OPERATION RESOLUTION
U||"In view of the fact that on the Khilafat question both the Indian and Imperial Governments have signally failed in their duty towards the Musalmans of India, and the Prime Minister has deliberately broken his pledged word given to them, and that it is the duty of every non-Moslem Indian in every legitimate manner to assist his Musalman brother in his attempt to remove the religious calamity that has over taken him:—
U||"And in view of the fact that in the matter of the events of the April 1919 both the said Governments have grossly neglected or failed to protect the innocent people of the Punjab and punish officers guilty of unsoldierly and barbarous behaviour towards them and have exonerated Sir Michael O'Dwyer who proved himself directly or indirectly responsible for the most official crimes and callous to the sufferings of the people placed under his administration, and that the debate in the House of Lords betrayed a woeful lack of sympathy with the people of India and showed virtual support of the systematic terrorism and frightfulness adopted in the Punjab and that the latest Viceregal pronouncement {25} is proof of entire absence of repentance in the matters of the Khilafat and the Punjab.
U||"This Congress is of opinion that there can be no contentment in India without redress of the two afore-mentioned wrongs, and that the only effectual means to vindicate national honour and to prevent a repetition of similar wrongs in future is the establishment of Swarajya. This Congress is further of opinion that there is no course left open for the people of India but to approve of and adopt the policy of progressive non-violent non-co-operation until the said wrongs are righted and Swarajya is established.
U||"And inasmuch as a beginning should be made by the classes who have hitherto moulded and represented opinion and inasmuch as Government consolidates its power through titles and honours bestowed on the people, through schools controlled by it, its law courts and its legislative councils, and inasmuch as it is desirable in the prosecution of the movement to take the minimum risk and to call for the least sacrifice compatible with the attainment of the desired object, this Congress earnestly advises:—
U||(a) surrender of titles and honorary offices and resignation from nominated seats in local bodies;
U||(b) refusal to attend Government Levees, Durbars and other official and semi-official functions held by Government officials or in their honour;
U||(c) gradual withdrawal of children from Schools and colleges owned, aided or controlled by Government and in place of such schools and colleges in the establishment {26} of National Schools and Colleges in the various Provinces;
U||(d) gradual boycott of British Courts by lawyers and litigants and establishment of private arbitration courts by their aid for the settlement of private disputes;
U||(e) refusal on the part of the military, clerical and labouring classes to offer themselves as recruits for service in Mesopotamia;
U||(f) withdrawal by candidates of their candidature for election to the Reformed Councils and refusal on the part of the voters for any candidate who may despite the Congress advice offer himself for election; and
U||(g) the boycott of foreign goods.
U||"And inasmuch as non-co-operation has been conceived of as a measure of discipline and self-sacrifice without which no nation can make real progress, and inasmuch as an opportunity should be given in the very first stage of non-co-operation to every man, woman and child, for such discipline and self-sacrifice, this Congress advises adoption of Swadeshi in piece goods on a vast scale, and inasmuch as the existing mills of India with indigenous capital and control do not manufacture sufficient yarn and sufficient cloth for the requirements of the nation, and are not likely to do so for a long time to come this Congress advises immediate stimulation of further manufacture on a large scale by means of reviving hand-spinning in every home and hand weaving on the part of the millions of weavers who have abandoned their ancient and honourable calling for want of encouragement."
U||{27} The Khilafat question first, the Punjab wrongs next are given as the two grounds for discarding the Reform Scheme and demanding Swarajya or immediate Home Rule for the prevention of similar wrongs in future. For the attainment of such Swarajya or immediate Home Rule a policy of what is called non-violent non-co-operation is advocated and as a beginning the people are advised to take certain steps which are therein referred to. Though discarding the Montagu Chelmsford Reform Scheme of Home Rule by certain stages, Mr. Gandhi says he is working for immediate Home Rule in accordance with the Resolution, to me it seems clear what he is really aiming at is not Home Rule of any kind or form i.e. Parliamentary Government with absolute powers, but Swarajya or Home Rule, as he himself has outlined it in his Indian Home Rule, the purport of which I have briefly given above, i.e. anarchy and soul force. I shall now attempt to show that there were no adequate reasons to discard the Reform Scheme of Home Rule for a s
U||cheme of immediate Home Rule and that the steps proposed to be taken are not calculated to attain Home Rule of any kind or form {28} but are steps intended for Gandhi Swarajya which means anarchy or soul force.
U||In considering these questions the object of this movement must not be lost sight of. In Mr. Gandhi's own words "Non-co-operation though a religious and strictly moral movement deliberately aims at the overthrow of the Government." Prima facie therefore all steps taken in pursuance of this resolution are intended for this purpose.
U||I propose first of all to take up the Khilafat question which stands first in the Resolution.
U||{29}
U||THE KHILAFAT QUESTION
U||With reference to this Khilafat agitation it is important to bear this in mind. After the armistice of 1918, there were two memorials presented on behalf of Turkey by the Muslim residents in England, one in January 1919 soon after the armistice, which included the names of His Highness the Aga Khan, Abbas Ali Baig, Rt. Hon. Ameer Ali, Messrs: Yusaf Ali, H. K. Kidwai etc.; and one at the end of the year in December 1919, the signatories thereof included such Mahomedans as the following: H. H. Aga Khan, Rt. Hon. Ameer Ali, Hon. Mr. Bhurgi, Mr. M. H. Kidwai. Both included many non-Mahomedans, some of them of great influence and position. They claimed for Turkey, Constantinople, Thrace, Anatolia including Smyrna. There was no claim for the countries occupied by those who were not Turks.
U||The Indian Mahomedan claim went much {30} further. By the deputation to the Viceroy towards the end of that year and by the subsequent deputation to the Prime Minister and others the claim was advanced for the restoration of Turkey to the pre-war state, giving Home Rule if necessary to the Armenians or the Arabs etc. under Turkish sovereignty. This of course was an impossible demand. The Arabs are entitled to as much consideration as the Turks. Mahomad Ali and Shaukat Ali are really responsible for this claim.
U||Another claim advocated in the Council of State in India was to let Turkey have Anatolia and Thrace; full independence be given to the Arabs and the countries inhabited by them without any control by any non-muslim power. Whether the evacuation of Aden is included in this, I am unable to say.
U||The Indian Mahomedan agitation has become a danger to the State on account of the failure of the Secretary of State and Government of India to tell the Indian Mahomedans that they, the Government have nothing to do with the Khilafat question; that their responsibility is confined to representing to the British cabinet the feelings of the Indian Mahomedans, and {31} the ultimate decision will depend upon what is good for the Empire as a whole.
U||But so far as Gandhi was concerned the position is quite clear. He puts forward whichever is the most extreme demand made by the Khilafat party without any enquiry as to their reasonableness. He relies upon a 'promise' made by Lloyd George in favour of Turkey about their home lands and Thrace discarding at the same time the limitation contained in the promise to the subject races that they will not again be placed under Turkey. He relies upon another statement made by Lloyd George that after this, recruitment went up. The fact is that the recruitment of non Mahomedans also went up and both were due to Sir Michael O'Dwyer. Though he now denies having insisted upon the evacuation of Egypt by England as a necessary condition of satisfaction of the Khilafat claim, he insists upon the withdrawal of the Indian troops. For what purpose he does not explain nor does he say whether he wants England to evacuate Egypt. He knows, I presume, that Egypt has repudiated the Caliph's authority. He was not apparently aware tha
U||t the Arabs will not recognize the supremacy of {32} any Turkish power. But this is no difficulty to him. For if that turns out to be the case he says the Arab Chief who held sway over Mecca and Medina might become the Khalif. That Syria is not under England did not matter. He wants the non-co-operators to be satisfied by England that she was not in any way responsible for the French occupation or retention of Syria, in which case he is willing to excuse her. He fails to appreciate the weight of what appears to be an insuperable objection that the Turks and their Khalif do not want any domination over Arabia but, as they said in their deputation in January-February, 1919, after the armistice, only wanted to be left alone with economic and political independence in their own ethnological area. Neither Mr. Gandhi nor the Khilafat advocates show any realisation of this fact. With a light heart they maintain that the question is not Turkish but Mahomedan and therefore Turkish opinion alone cannot decide the ques
U||tion. Palestine, of course, according to Mr. Gandhi, must be under Turkish sovereignty. It is enough for him that the prophet of Arabia has so willed it. The prophets of {33} Israel or the founder of Christianity, Jewish or Christian sentiments, are as nothing in the balance. The real truth of course is that in the case of the Khilafat agitation Mr. Gandhi and some of its most active and prominent leaders want to use the agitation to destroy the Government and not to effect a real settlement of the question. The most energetic of the promoters of the movement were Mohomed Ali and Shaukat Ali. They were active members of the Muslim League advocating Mahomedan interests in opposition to the Hindus in the old days of the Bengal Partition agitation. In their public speeches they emphasised the identity of the interests of the Indian Mahomedans with the interests of the Mahomedans elsewhere in Tripoli and Algeria in preference to those of the Hindus, though living under the same Government with them. Since the Ba
U||lkan wars, however, on account of their intense hatred towards the British Government for their failure to assist their co-religionists in the West, they found it politic to approach the Hindus. Then followed the internment of the brothers which naturally still more embittered their feelings towards the Government. {34} During the internment they did not cease to preach sermons of virulence against the Government, and even after their release they did not cease their propaganda of hatred against the British Government. The independence of India—no doubt as a preliminary step towards a subsequent Mahomedan domination in India—was as much their object as the full restoration of the Khilafat domination to its pre-war condition. This was avowed by the Ali Brothers themselves. Mr. Shaukat Ali said in April 1920:—
U||"We do not embark on this step without fully realising what it means. It means a movement for absolute independence."
U||In fact, to those who know them or who have read the proceedings of their trial no evidence of this kind is required.
U||At the Khilafat Conference in Karachi—of which they were the guiding spirits—held on the 9th of July 1921 the following resolution calling upon the Mohomedan sepoys to desert in the name of religion was passed:
U||"The meeting clearly proclaims that it is in every way religiously unlawful for a Mussalman at the present movement to continue in the British Army or to induce others to join the army, and it is the duty of all the {35} Mussalmans in general and Ulemas in particular to see that these religious commandments are brought home to every Mussalman in the army and that if no settlement is arrived at before Christmas regarding our campaign an Indian republic will be declared at the Ahmedabad sessions of the Congress."
U||The two brothers were tried and convicted by the ordinary civil courts, and the judge pointed out that however lawful and constitutional the Khilafat committee may have been in its origin, however permissible the agitation carried on in its earlier stages, those who were controlling it soon began to rely on dangerous religious propaganda. About them he said: "They had seen them in Court, heard their statements in the Lower Court and their speeches here, and they could have no doubt that with the exception of accused No. Six (a Hindu) they openly gloried in their hatred of the Government of India and the British name. They justified the above resolution by the religious law of the Koran which they said the Mussalmans are bound to follow even when opposed to the law of the land. All the Mohamedans in this case including Mohamad Ali and Shaukat Ali maintained, 'first, that their religion compels them to do certain {36} acts, secondly, that no law which restrains them from doing those acts which their religion c
U||ompels them to do has any validity, and thirdly, that in answer to a charge of breaking the law of the land it is sufficient to raise and prove the plea that the act which is alleged to be an offence is one which is enjoyed by their religion.'"
U||It is impossible to believe that Gandhi and his adherents are not aware that this claim of the Mahomedans to be judged only by the law of the Koran, is a claim which is the fons et origo of all Khilafat claims of whatever kind. It is as well to be clear about this, for not only does the acceptance of the claim mean the death knell of the British Empire or Indo-British commonwealth, whatever name we may care to give to the great fraternity of nations to which we belong, but specifically as regards India it means a real denial of Swaraj. For it involves Mahomedan rule and Hindu subjection or Hindu Rule and Mahomedan subjection. Let there be no mistake about this, no camouflage. Whatever the Hindus may mean by the Hindu Muslim entente, and I believe they mean a true equality, and {37} whatever the more enlightened Mussalmans may mean, Mohamad Ali, Shaukat Ali, and those of their persuasion, mean a Mussalman dominion pure and simple, though they are of course clever enough to keep the cat in the bag so long as t
U||he time for its emergence is yet unripe. They protest, it need hardly be said, that they are animated by no arriere pensee, no sectarian spirit, only by the most loving goodwill towards the Hindu brethren. But there are some of us who are too experienced to be caught by this mischievous and pernicious chaff and must sound the warning to those less experienced and more gullible. Considering the high character of some of the men who follow Gandhi, I can only believe that this realization came to them so late that it was difficult for them to withdraw.
U||As pointed out in the Karachi trial, these movements at first appear innocuous, then grow dangerous.
U||The Khilafat associations throughout the country were intended to carry on the "non-violent non-co-operation" campaign against Government. The process of evolution from ostensible non-violence at first to violence is {38} so well described by Mr. Macpherson speaking, in the Legislative Council that I have quoted it (App. XVI). It applies to all organisations, but with greater force to Khilafat for reasons arising out of Islam which will be shortly explained. There is no judicial description of this development in Malabar, the most notorious instance. I shall content myself, therefore, with giving a summary of the judgment convicting certain persons for a riot in Malegaon in April, 1920. So early had lawlessness in this form begun to show itself. It will also explain the methods adopted.
U||A political movement began in Malegaon on the 15th March 1920, when a "Khilafat Committee" and a body of "volunteers" were formed. The Committee's activities took the shape of lectures and "wazas". The lectures were political and the "wazas" are said to have been religious sermons. In January, 1921, Shaukat Ali visited the town and lectured on the Khilafat movement. It was shortly after this visit that political activity became intensified.
U||The two Mahomedan schools, the Beitulullum and the Anjuman school, used to receive {39} grants-in-aid from Government. Money was raised to enable the two State-aided schools to refuse the Government grant-in-aid in pursuance of the non-co-operation movement, and a few Hindus were members of the party. The collections were to be made by means of a "paisa" fund, an old idea. Every person selling a "sari", that is all the weavers in Malegaon, were required to pay a "paisa" or quarter of an anna to the fund.
U||The system left practically no option to the weavers who objected to pay the "paisa". Objecting buyers were encountered by persecution. The fund Committee called a public meeting on the 27th February, at which it was resolved that the buyers refusing to make the collections as directed should be commercially boycotted. The commercial boycott of the recalcitrant buyers was enforced by picketing their shops with volunteers and their business was stopped. The former had appealed for protection to the authorities by applications and petitions, but so long as nothing actually illegal was done these were powerless actively to interfere.
U||Meanwhile lectures and "wazas" were being {40} continually held in the open spaces in the town and excitement was running high. On the reports made to him the District Magistrate came to the conclusion that in a place like Malegaon which is ill-lighted the carrying of swords and cudgels at public meetings at night by volunteers was likely to lead to a breach of the peace. He therefore issued a proclamation on the 30th March prohibiting the practice. It was a breach of the terms of this proclamation and its enforcement by prosecutions which was the immediate excuse for the riot.
U||But the local authorities had also tried to allay the friction and excitement in other ways. The Sub-Divisional Officer, had called a meeting on the 13th March with a view to find a method of collection of the Fund which might put an end to the trouble about it and stop enforced contributions. Collection boxes were recommended, but nothing definite was agreed to by the other side.
U||Some of the leaders were persuaded to issue a manifesto which was signed by eleven persons. This manifesto quotes Mr. Gandhi's dictates to non-violence and exhorts the volunteers {41} not to carry cudgels and recommends that only peaceful methods should be used in collecting the Funds.
U||It clearly had little effect. One of the men who signed it, on the 4th April (it had been issued on the 1st April) at a public meeting apologized for it on his own and the other signatories' behalf and they were pardoned for having signed it. Meanwhile the boycotting and picketing of the shops of the Anti-Fund people was continued. On the 15th prosecutions were instituted against 24 volunteers for a breach of the District Magistrate's proclamation of the 30th March. On the 24th April, the day before the hearing of these cases, a meeting was again called at night at which a leading Mahomedan is reported to have used the following words:—
U||"They must not be afraid of Government or of the police and that the volunteers would see about the cases brought against them and may God give the volunteers strength to promote their religion." The next day April 25th twelve of these cases came on for hearing before Mr. Thakar the Resident Magistrate. They ended in the conviction of the 6 volunteers {42} and their being fined Rs. 50 each with the alternative of 4 weeks' simple imprisonment. The fines were not paid.
U||On the result being known the mob that had collected gave vent to their feelings by loud cries of "Alla-ho-akbar," the war cry used by the mob throughout the riot, assaulted all the police to be found in the town of Malegoan, burned a temple, killed the Sub-Inspector of Police, not the only one killed and threw his body into the fire and looted the houses of all who were opposed to the Khilafat movement, the owners themselves having fled in the meantime.
U||This illustrates the 'non-violent' methods followed by the Khilafat committees and volunteers. I give another instance in full for illustration Barabanki (App. XI) which shows perhaps more forcibly the violent fanaticism supporting the movement. More instances can be easily given.
U||The development from an apparently peaceful to a revolutionary attitude is strikingly illustrated in the Khilafat agitation not only by revolutionary activities but by open declaration. The resolution of the Karachi Conference {43} showed the Mahomedan intention to declare independence and proclaim an Indian Republic at the following Congress at Ahmedabad in December 1921. A resolution for absolute independence was actually passed in the Subjects Committee of the Khilafat Conference at Ahmedabad, but was not passed at the Conference itself only because the President ruled it out of order. But immediately after the meeting formally closed, the motion was passed by the members of the Conference at the instance of the President of Muslim League whose speech as President will amply repay perusal (App. XVIII). He was in effect only carrying out at the Khilafat Conference the intention of the Karachi Conference of which the Ali Brothers were the moving spirits. In his speech he points out, what in effect is appare
U||nt to all, that Islam is opposed to non-violence and, as he said in the course of one of his speeches, the Mussalmans accepted it on the promise of Mr. Gandhi to secure Swaraj within a year. It was a legitimate move therefore to proclaim a rebellion. Another difference in principle was pointed out which is productive of frightful consequences and must {44} alienate Hindus from Mahomedans. The Ali Brothers had already said that if the Afghans invaded India to wage a holy war the Indian Mahomedans are not only bound to fight them but also to fight the Hindus if they refuse to co-operate with them. When therefore Gandhi and his followers fraternised with the Khilafatists, the latter had no doubt of their support if eventually it came to rebellion. They were confirmed in this by Gandhi's attitude on the questions in issue between them and the Hindus. He advises the latter Hindus—to submit themselves to Mahomedan dictation. He begs them not to insist on the prohibition of the cow slaughter by Mahomedans and to 
U||rely upon Mahomedan forbearance to afford them relief in that direction. On the other hand he advises the Hindus to refrain from irritating the Mahomedans by insisting on carrying their processions past the mosques on their religious occasions. He advises them to study Hindustani as against Hindi; in fact complete submission to the Muslim feelings in all matters in controversy between them. His attitude towards the Mopla outrages shows the extent of his surrender. His alliance with the {45} Khilafat movement has led to frightful results in Malabar. Relying on the assurance of Gandhi and his followers, of Hindu support for the Khilafat movement, and supported by the teaching that the Hindus may be treated as foes on failure to support them in a holy war, the Moplas when they rose against the British Government were furious at the Hindu attitude of loyalty to England. The result was, themselves, armed and organised they took the Hindus unawares and committed atrocities too well known, to need recapitulation he
U||re—butchered them and inflicted injuries on them far worse than death.
U||For sheer brutality on women, I do not remember anything in history to match the Malabar rebellion. It broke out about the 20th of August. Even by the 6th of September the results were dreadful. The Viceroy's speech made on that date deserves careful attention (App. I).
U||The atrocities committed more particularly on women are so horrible and unmentionable that I do not propose to refer to them in this book. I have selected a few accounts out of literally hundreds that might be selected from {46} the English and vernacular papers (App. III). One narrative is by Mrs. Besant. The resolution passed at a meeting presided over by the Zamorin Maharaja at which, many of the leading Hindus in the District were present enters a strong protest against the attempts made by interested persons to minimize the gravity of the occurrence (App. V). The moving appeal signed by many ladies headed by the senior Rani of Nilambur who belongs to one of the wealthiest families and were rulers in ancient days shows the nature of the atrocities and the apprehensions still entertained after the rebellion is quelled (App. IV). I do not think it advisable to publish any more but I would point out in addition to those mentioned in these articles two other forms of torture credibly reported as having been 
U||resorted to in the case of men—flaying alive, and making them dig their own graves before their slaughter. It is now ascertained that the Mahomedans had held frequent meetings in their mosques and, had made all preparations for a rising. Hence it was difficult for the Hindus in these tracts to make any defence or escape. The horrid tragedy continued for months. {47} Thousands of Mahomedans killed, and wounded by troops, thousands of Hindus butchered, women subjected to shameful indignities, thousands forcibly converted, persons flayed alive, entire families burnt alive, women it is said hundreds throwing themselves into wells to avoid dishonour, violence and terrorism threatening death standing in the way of reversion to their own religion. This is what Malabar in particular owes to the Khilafat agitation, to Gandhi and his Hindu friends. The President of the Indian Moslem League, following the Ali injunction, justified the Mahomedan atrocities as an act of war against the Hindus and the Government. Gandhi
U|| too pleaded for the Mahomedans. All this was too much even for their dupes who have entered a spirited protest (App. III). It is impossible after all I have said above that there can be any sympathy with the Khilafat agitation. The future may be envisaged. Gandhi and his dupes have led Khilafatists to understand that the Hindus will stand by them in any contingency, impliedly assuring them, as they believed in Malabar, of support even in resistance to British rule. This Islamic consciousness {48} which looks to a brotherhood beyond India and beyond the Empire does not support the claim for early concession of Home Rule, for Home Rule means Home Rule within the Empire, not outside it—the Home Rule enjoyed by the self-governing constituents of the commonwealth. The Empire, it will be reasonably urged, cannot afford to place great power in the hands of a party which would subordinate the interests of the Empire and of India to the interests of a large body outside the Empire who actually stand in opposition 
U||to it. The introduction of this religious element in this manner is fatal to the well-being of the Empire, and unless some other basis can be found for the Hindu-Mahomedan entente, it must go. The extent to which Mr. Gandhi is prepared to go in support of the Khilafat claim is stated in this extract:—
U||"What will the Imperial Government do if France were to attempt to deprive England of Dover and India were secretly to help France or openly to show indifference or hostility to England's struggle to retain Dover? Can Indians be expected to sit idle when the Khilafat is vivisected?"
U||It is one thing to ask the Empire or India to go to war in favour of an oppressed class—but {49} to ask her to do it in the interests of co-religionists of a community living outside the Empire is very different.
U||What is the present position? I shall describe it in the words of one of Mr. Gandhi's dupes, a secretary of a District Congress Committee, Mr. K. Madhavan Nair of Calicut, who writes on January 4th as follows:—
U||Now the position is this:—
U||The Hindus and Mohamedans have been waging a common war with non-violence as the fundamental creed. It has to be noted however, that there is a party led by the Maulana that advocates violence for the achievement of their object. Suppose to-morrow that party takes to violence and the other remains non-violent, what will be the fate of the non-violent party if Maulana's views are pushed to their logical conclusion? Is freedom worth having if in the attainment of it you have to loot, murder and outrage your innocent neighbour who does not agree with you or approve of your methods and is Swaraj possible of achievement and the Khilafat likely to be righted by such means? Maulana's views make those who have absolutely no faith in violence to think over these facts deeply and anxiously.
U||The Indian Non-Mahomedans, did not trouble themselves about the Khilafat claims. Mr. Gandhi and his followers took it up as an anti-British movement to secure Mahomedan support {50} to his non-co-operation movement. Even that non-Mahomedan sympathy with the Khilafat movement, has vanished. That movement acquired its strength on account of such unfortunate statements that the Secretary of State and the Government of India are in hearty sympathy with the Moslim demands; statements like those reported to have been made by His Highness Aga Khan that Mr. Montagu is doing as much as it is possible to support the Mahomedan claim and Gandhi himself could not have done more. I doubt whether any influential newspaper or any publicist in America, England or the continent support the Khilafat claim as advanced by Indian Mahomedans or by Gandhi. However, the reputed sentiments of Mr. Montagu and the Government of India have influenced even moderate Mahomedans and Hindus to support them against the cabinet in starting and
U|| supporting an agitation, which has now assumed dangerous proportions.
U||The Khilafat movement does not want, and Mr. Gandhi is not for, any reasonable settlement of the Mahomedan grievance or for Home Rule. They wish to get rid of the {51} British Government. Such being the objective naturally the Khilafat Indian agitators have put forward demands which the Turks themselves recognise as outside practical politics. They have hampered the efforts of their friends for a revision of the treaty of Sevres. Everybody now realises that this attitude of the Khilafat movement under the guidance of Gandhi and Mahomed Ali stood in the way of any reasonable settlement. It is a futile endeavour of the Indian and British Governments to satisfy Mr. Gandhi or the Khilafat agitators led by the Ali brothers. Gandhi and his followers have greatly encouraged the growth of Indian Pan Islamism which will in future be always opposed to other Religions and civilizations. I can well understand the adherent of large numbers of Mussulmans to the idea of Pan-Islamism. It must naturally have a fascination fo
U||r devotees of Islam by reason of the splendour of its promise that Mussulmans the world over shall one day be united under one flag, but we have to take the world as it is and to take into the consideration the forces actually at work in reconstruction. The world has passed the stage of religious empires. It {52} has gone beyond the stage of religious crusades. We are on the threshold of an era of a brotherhood transcending religious differences, transcending even national differences and of which one of the dominant notes is a unity of purpose in which religious differences of race and customs are to be merged and harmonised. Pan-Islamism or Pan-Christianity or Pan-Budhism—one can hardly speak of Pan-Hinduism—belong to the world that is dead and not to the world that is living. They mean destruction, proselytisation, the assertion of superiority the world war was waged to destroy. This also shows the dangerous foundation on which the Gandhi movement rests. Home Rule or Swaraj is claimed not as an end in
U|| itself but for the purpose of righting the alleged wrongs sustained by foreigners. We know Gandhi's principles which I have set forth above. Swaraj or political independence is not what he really wants. It is not the Caliph grievances that have led him to claim political independence. He wants to destroy the British Government, as a hater of all Governments.
U||The attitude of the Government towards the people of the Punjab and the Punjab officials {53} is stated in the Congress Resolution as the second and the only other reason for this non-co-operation campaign against the Government.
U||{54}
U||THE PUNJAB ATROCITIES
U||No one feels for the Punjab more than I do. I doubt whether anybody was in a position to know more of it than I was. Even now with all the enquiries made by the Hunter Commission and by the Congress Sub-Committee many deplorable incidents as bad as any, worse perhaps, than any reported have not been disclosed. At this distance of time it is best that they should remain so. It is with a full knowledge of this that I make the following remarks.
U||The conditions now have entirely changed. Before the Reforms under a Lieutenant-Governor, a single individual, the atrocities in the Punjab which we know only too well, could be committed almost with impunity. Now instead of one man the Government of the Punjab consist not only of a Governor who no doubt is an Englishman, but of an Executive Council consisting of an Englishman and an {55} Indian, who was a non official before appointment to his seat in the Council and for all practical purposes two Indian Ministers who are also consulted in all important matters. Though, therefore, a repetition of the old incidents may be possible, it is unlikely. The Government of India again, which then consisted of only one Indian, now includes three Indian members, a powerful contingent. Above all, it will be remembered that it was necessary to pass an Act of Indemnity to save the delinquents from proceedings in civil and criminal Courts. Such an Act of Indemnity would scarcely be possible now, with a Legislative Assembl
U||y consisting of a majority of elected members under the new constitution. The trouble in the Punjab arose out of the Rowlat Act which is repealed. Many high handed proceedings were taken under the Regulations of 1818 the provisions of which were applied for purposes for which they were never intended. The regulations are now repealed so far as the matters are concerned. Many of these proceedings were taken under the Defence of India Act and they also have gone so that for the future at any rate our position is very different {56} from what it was in the past. In such circumstances what is it that one would expect? If it is an honest endeavour that is being made to solve the difficulties which arose out of the Punjab, one would expect a demand for any further guarantees that may be necessary against a repetition of such occurrences and the punishment of those who have acted not under an error of judgment and not in good faith. But the demands now made are of a very different kind. They do not seek for further
U|| guarantees, at least none are formulated.
U||I realise that the eulogium passed by the English Cabinet on Lord Chemsford and Sir Michael O'Dwyer was an outrage on Indian public opinion. I believe also that the Government of India committed a great political blunder in not publishing their proceedings, punishing the subordinate officials in accordance with the orders of the Cabinet. I agree further that it was an egregious mistake to pass the Indemnity Act when India was so excited. The Government should have waited for the result of the proceedings in Civil or Criminal Courts, when they might have pardoned those who acted in good faith {57} reimbursing their expenses. But that is not the question now. Mr. Gandhi and his party want certain persons to be punished on the strength of the report submitted by the Congress Committee who made an ex parte enquiry of their own without hearing the other side. This is not right. Moreover every where it is recognised that the security of the subject, person and property, requires that the punishment of the guilty s
U||hould be in the hands of the Courts and not within the discretion of an Executive Council. If these officers whose punishment is called for are guilty it is the Courts that ought to punish them, and I speak with knowledge when I say that no steps open to them have yet been taken by those who carry on the agitation to vindicate justice. Is it possible, then, to maintain that the Punjab question in any way justifies the tremendous agitation that is being carried on for the dismemberment of the Empire. Besides how is it possible for any reasonable man to say that this affords any justification for not utilizing the Legislative Councils to help the Punjab and to carry out the reforms of which the country is urgently in {58} need. Besides it must be remembered that some of the Punjab political leaders have failed in their duty. During the crisis they refused to come forward to substantiate their complaints of maladministration of Martial Law, even of those matters within their personal knowledge. They did not giv
U||e a chance to the Government of India to control the Government of the Punjab or the administration of Martial law. The real truth, of course, is that the Punjab grievances are only a pretext for this agitation, by the violent section headed by Mr. Gandhi. It is really not the redress of the Punjab grievances or prevention of the repetition of atrocities that is sought for, so much as the expulsion of the British Government from India.
U||{59}
U||SWARAJ OR HOME RULE
U||The Resolution says that on account of the failure of Government to redress these grievances we must have 'Swaraj.' It is important to remember that long before these occurrences Mr. Gandhi had come to the conclusion that we must have Independence. It would accordingly seem dishonest on his part to say that these events led him to the demand for Swaraj or Home Rule.
U||In his scheme of "Home Rule for India" Mr. Gandhi said:—
U||"Now you will have seen that it is not necessary for us to have as our goal the expulsion of the English. If the English became Indianised we can accommodate them. If they wish to remain in India along with their civilisation, there is no room for them. It lies with us to bring about such a state of things."
U||Then in reply to the question that it is impossible that Englishmen should ever become Indianised, he says:—
U||"To say that is equivalent to saying that the English {60} have no humanity in them. And it is really beside the point whether they become so or not. If we keep our own house in order only those who are fit to live in it will remain. Others will leave of their own accord."
U||It is something that he gives a loophole to the Englishman to remain in India. To the question that there may be chaos and anarchy on account of the Hindu Mahomedan position he states:—
U||"I would prefer any day anarchy and chaos in India to an armed peace brought about by the bayonet between the Hindus and Musalmans."
U||When it was pointed out to him that the dissensions amongst the Hindus themselves may cause the same result he is not dismayed. He says:—
U||"We are not to assume that the English have changed the nature of the Pindarries and the Bhils. It is therefore better to suffer the Pindarri peril than that some one else should protect us from it and thus render us effeminate. I should prefer to be killed by the arrow of the Bhil than to seek nominal protection."
U||When it was pointed out to him that for Home Rule at this stage we have not got an army for our own protection he said the other day:—
U||"I am here to confess that we are fully able to take charge of all military dispositions in the {61} country and that we feel able to deal with all foreign complications." The worst that may happen is he continued that we may be blotted out from the face of the earth for which he was prepared so long as he can breathe the free atmosphere of India.
U||The following report is interesting; we give it below from the "Daily Express."
U||Q:—Are you anxious to take over the whole control of the army at once or would you make an exception of that object?
U||A:—I think we are entirely ready to take up the whole control of the Army which means practically disbanding three fourths of it. I would keep just enough to police India.
U||Q:—If the army were reduced to that extent, do you not apprehend anything aggressive from the frontier territories?
U||A:—No.
U||Q:—My information, derived from Military sources, is that there are over half-a-million armed men on the frontier.
U||A:—You are right, I agree.
U||Q:—These tribes have frequently attacked India hitherto. Why do you think they will refrain from doing so when India possesses Home Rule?
U||A:—In the first instance, the world's views have changed and secondly the preparations that are now made in Afghanistan are really in support of the Khilafat. But when the Khilafat question is out of the way, then the Afghan people will not have any design {62} on India. The warrior tribes who live on loot and plunder are given lakhs of rupees as subsidy. I would also give them a little subsidy. When the Charka comes into force in India, I would introduce the spinning wheel among the Afghan tribes also and thus prevent them from attacking the Indian territories. I feel that the tribesmen are in their own way God-fearing people.
U||But for the fact that he is well known to be a Saint and Mahatma, I would have had no hesitation in saying that his last observations about meeting the Afghans show him to be either a fool or a knave.
U||He said on the 16th February 1921:—
U||"There must be complete independence, if England's policy is in conflict with the Moslim sentiment on the Khilafat question or with the Indian sentiment in the Punjab."
U||And in his recent speech at the congress opposing the resolution for Independence it was said that if the Punjab and Khilafat demands are complied with, Independence is not necessary. Well, he knows or ought to know they are impossible demands. The implication is plain and taken in conjunction with what has been said above as to the Western civilisation and the Indianisation of the English people, the conclusion that he is really aiming at {63} Independence is inevitable. To certain Boy Scouts on the 23rd March he was quite plain. He said:—
U||"No Indian could remain loyal in the accepted sense to the Empire as it was at present represented and be loyal to God at the same time. An Empire that could be responsible for the terrorism of the martial law regime, that would not repent of the wrong, that could enter into secret treaties in breach of solemn obligations could only be reckoned as a Godless Empire. Loyalty to such an Empire was disloyalty to God".
U||These have to be borne in mind when we consider the question of the Swaraj that he has put forward. The Swaraj that he works for is thus described:—
U||"Swaraj means full Dominion status. The scheme of such swaraj shall be framed by representatives duly elected in terms of the Congress constitution. That means four anna franchise. Every Indian adult, male or female, paying four annas and signing the Congress creed will be entitled to be placed on the electoral list. These would elect delegates who would frame Swaraj constitution. This shall be given effect to without any change by the British Parliament".
U||A more preposterous demand cannot be imagined. He excludes all those who do not belong to his Congress. Those who do not pay annas four and sign the congress creed form the {64} majority of the population. Again to ask the British Parliament to accept the scheme framed by his party however absurd, without examination of the same is absolute nonsense. If Mr. Gandhi and his party can frame a scheme of Swaraj for the consideration of the rest of India, have it discussed with others modified if necessary after such discussion, it may be, and it ought to be placed before the Government and Parliament. But this is the last thing he will do, for various reasons. Mr. Gandhi himself will never do it because I doubt whether he has any correct idea of the Dominion status and all that it involves. Mr. Gandhi is not a student but an impulsive fanatic indifferent to facts but obsessed by phantasmagoria. He jumps to what he calls conclusions but which have in fact no premises. Again he will not see it done because what he 
U||really desires is not an honest settlement which will give India a further instalment of Swaraj but as the preceding extracts show what he wants is really absolute independence according to his professions but really anarchy or soul force. If he were honest in his desire to secure Swaraj he and his followers would not have boycotted {65} the Councils but would have entered them to take further steps towards its attainment.
U||I am therefore satisfied that Mr. Gandhi does not aim at a fair settlement of the Punjab difficulties. He does not want an equitable peace satisfying the just claims of the Mahomedans. He does not want Parliamentary Swaraj or Home Rule. But for tactical purposes he is putting them forward to destroy the English Government, in order to attain his object of a society outlined in his "Indian Home Rule," some features of it I have set forth above.—A society without Government, Railways, Hospitals, Schools, Courts, etc. His programme is therefore put forward to clear the way to obtain his object. This Swaraj is to be attained by, in the words of the Resolution, non-violent non-co-operation with Government. And among others the following steps were recommended for adoption: (1) Boycott of Government aided schools and colleges and establishment of National schools and colleges, (2) Boycott of British Courts by Lawyers and Litigants (3) Boycott of Reformed Councils (4) Boycott of Foreign goods and use of spinning 
U||wheels. Out of these I shall naturally {66} take up the question of the boycott of Government and aided institutions and the nature of education sought to be imparted by Mr. Gandhi.
U||{67}
U||EDUCATION
U||The system of Education which Mr. Gandhi apparently wants to introduce has already been tried in some parts of India. The results of a teaching confined to Eastern classics and vernaculars has already been apparent. It has produced a mentality amongst Hindus and Mahomedans which has divided them from one another. It has separated still further the Brahmins from non-Brahmins, the caste Hindus from the noncaste Hindus. It has again produced amongst those who have received that education a vague longing for speculative theories and a distaste for experiment and research by which, theories may be tested. Of course Mr. Gandhi does not know these results. His speeches and writings do not show that he ever cared to enquire into these questions. He does not want education to be imparted to the masses and Western education to be imparted to anybody for the reason that it would make {68} them discontented with their present lot in life, i.e. in other words he wants each class to remain in its present condition, the lo
U||wer castes, slaves of their masters—the higher classes. This consequence follows from his acceptance of the caste system. He says "Varanashram (caste system) is inherent in human nature and Hinduism has simply reduced it to a science. It does attach by birth. A man cannot change his Varna by choice. Prohibition against intermarriage and interdining is essential for a rapid evolution of the soul." He would relegate those Hindus outside the pale of caste, the panchamas or the so-called degraded classes, by whatever name they are called, to degradation for the service of the higher castes. His writings or speeches do not show any knowledge of Indian History and having spent the main portion of his life in a far-off country the evils of the system perhaps never came to his knowledge. Otherwise he would have learnt the following facts. It is this caste system which has brought about the conquest of India by the Mahomedans and the Englishmen, both of whom were always supported by the lower castes against the hig
U||her. {69} It is responsible for the large conversions to Christianity and Mahomedanism. It is responsible for a degradation of humanity for which no parallel can be found in slavery, ancient or modern. It is responsible for a good deal of Hindu-Mahomedan, Brahmin non-Brahmin problem and stands in the way of our social, economical and political progress. Yet Mr. Gandhi supports the system, though he advocates the removal of one or two blots which hardly affect the main structure. He enters on an elaborate disquisition on the benefits and necessity of caste which will not do credit to Macaulay's fourth form schoolboy. He shows no knowledge of the vast literature on the subject or of the main arguments against it. He is supporting the caste system to secure the support of the higher castes, without whose financial support his agitation must collapse. One of his own followers would have told him that caste has killed all the arts and science in this country. Sir P. C. Ray points out in his history of Hindu chemi
U||stry:—"the fear of losing caste was thus responsible for the loss of the faculty of independent enquiry and hence for the decline and decay of {70} all the arts and sciences for which India was once so famous." Of course he does not want that education which is indispensable for those who occupy the higher Government offices in the country. He does not want that education which is essential for the development of Indian manufacturing industries and development of mineral resources.
U||Mr. Gandhi accordingly made his wicked attempt to destroy the National Hindu University of Benares and the Mahomedan University of Aligarh. They combined Eastern and Western learning. The attempt was happily unsuccessful. Strong pressure was put upon the students to leave the Schools and Colleges. Looking to the final results as disclosed in the Report of the Congress Secretary reviewing the work of 1921, Government have reasons to congratulate themselves. By far the majority of the aided institutions in Bengal have been recognised by the Educational Authorities to be very inefficient and they have been attempting either to disaffiliate them or reduce their numbers to give more efficient instruction to those who remain, as a good number of them were institutions started for commercial purpose. {71} It is remarkable that the great majority of the students who obeyed the Congress cause belonged to these aided institutions. Those who left the Government Schools and Colleges with better discipline and more effic
U||ient teaching were very few if any. I would refer the reader for further information as to the results of the education campaign to the speech of the President of the Thana conference, a genuine patriot who happens, however, to be one of Gandhi's followers (App. VI).
U||Mr. Gandhi asked all the boys to withdraw now from the schools on the pretence that until the Government punishes the Punjab offenders in the manner advocated by him and satisfies the claims of the Khilafatists we should no longer associate with the Government, and we can there-by hasten the advent of Swaraj. This is a mere pretext. He advocated the substitution of the national kind of education as outlined by him in favour of the present system of education long before there was any Punjab or Khilafat questions. He advocated them in 1908 in his book "The Indian Home Rule." To say now that he advocated them on account of those reasons is sheer hypocrisy. {72} The step will not hasten but might retard Swaraj. Even if the Punjab wrongs are redressed in the manner suggested and even if the Khilafatists are satisfied and Parliamentary Swaraj obtained, he will still be an advocate of the abstention from English Schools in favour of the system of national education as above set forth.
U||{73}
U||VAKILS AND COURTS
U||The same is the case about his propaganda about the Vakils and the Courts. It never had any chance of success. I shall not dwell however upon this but would refer to Thana President's speech to which in connection with education attention has been already drawn (App. VI). He now puts them forth ostensibly for the purpose of compelling the Government to redress the Punjab and other wrongs. As a fact he advocated them long before that in 1908, as I have already pointed out above. Here again it is sheer hypocrisy to say that they are advocated not as an end in themselves but as a means for the redress of the Punjab and Khilafat wrongs. He dare not openly advocate this as desirable in itself as he would then be laughed at.
U||{74}
U||BOYCOTT OF COUNCILS
U||The other step that he advocates is abstention from the new councils. His followers generally have not voted at the elections or have stood for election. His reason given at the Calcutta Congress in September 1920 when he moved his resolution on non-co-operation is this. "I now come to the burning topic viz. the boycott of the councils. Sharpest difference of opinion existed regarding this and if the house was to divide on it, it must divide on one viz. whether Swaraj has to be gained through the councils or without the councils. If we utterly distrust the British Government and we know that they are to-day unrepentant now can you believe that the councils will lead to Swaraj and not tighten the British hold on India"? I can only ask him to read the history of the Parliamentary struggle for freedom in England which will show how freedom is won from reluctant monarchs and privileged {75} classes. Even in India the subsequent history of the Legislative councils has shown that the Government is willing to meet 
U||the councils half way and almost every question taken up by the councils has been advanced nearer solution. But I doubt whether there is any use of arguing with Mr. Gandhi. The real truth is as he has candidly avowed in his "Indian Home Rule" that Parliamentary Government is in itself bad and India should not strive after it as it will stand in the way of his spiritual Swaraj. I need not argue this point so far as the followers of Gandhi are concerned as they are heartily sorry that they boycotted the councils. I refer on this point also to the Thana Conference President's speech (App. VII). They feel ashamed of themselves the majority of them desire the dissolution of the present councils and a re-election so that they might utilize these councils for more powerful Parliaments. Perhaps I should add that considering the undisciplined fanaticism of the non-co-operator and his total ignorance of development of political organization, it is probably just as well that the councils were {76} in their inception pr
U||eserved from such a calamitous invasion. The council and the assembly have even in the short duration of their existence, achieved good results which are carrying us far and quietly on that true road to Home Rule from which Mr. Gandhi seeks to divert us. Had the Non-Co-operators been members of these councils and had they acted in their present temper, they might well have wrecked the Reforms and have set back the clock of India's progress even more than they have done already. The boycotting is therefore in all probability a blessing though designed as a curse. Still the fact remains that the Councils might have done even more had Mr. Gandhi been endowed with the wisdom to see that India's interests would best be served by using the councils and the assembly as levers to obtain further freedom on sane, safe, and constitutional lines.
U||{77}
U||BOYCOTT OF FOREIGN GOODS
U||There is not only no objection to the Charka but it is very much to be commended. It is very useful as a cottage or home industry and will find an occupation to many who might otherwise be idle. But it will not displace foreign goods at least without the aid of mills by foreign machinery.
U||All these with other minor ones are only steps to be taken to carry out the policy of non-violent non-co-operation for the attainment of Swaraj and Mr. Gandhi asks every body, in fact the people of India, to carry on non-violent non-co-operation with the Government so as ostensibly to attain Swaraj but really I have no doubt as an end in itself.
U||I have already pointed out that non-violent submission to suffering and the consequent attainment of self-control over oneself which he called Swaraj was the end which he had in view. He found that there was no use in {78} directly advocating it. He therefore puts it forward as the chief instrument for obtaining the Parliamentary Swaraj which the people of India wanted. He based his appeal to the Hindus on the well known doctrine of "Ahimsa". I will not stop here to discuss how far suffering for the purpose of inducing another to follow a particular line of conduct is included in the scope of Ahimsa. I myself believe it is not only not so included but is totally inconsistent with it. I will merely point out that this principle has already been condemned by the Penal Code which makes it a crime for a creditor to realise his debt by Dharna. For my purpose it is only necessary to say that this principle of non-violence if accepted in practice generally will lead to chaos and anarchy. If applied to Government al
U||one by refusal to recognise the jurisdiction of the courts it will lead to the same results. How it will lead to 'Parliamentary Swaraj' it is impossible to see. Mr. Gandhi says if all the people of India adopted it the machinery of Government is bound to come to a standstill. But that all will adopt it without leaving sufficient men with the aid of those who will be imported {79} from England and elsewhere to carry out the administration is only the fantasy of a diseased imagination. Non-violence is a guarantee on the part of those who carry it out that the Government has nothing to fear from physical force. If they use force then they abandon the weapon of non-violence. Mr. Gandhi and his followers, are agreed that physical force is now out of the question on ground, according to Mr. Gandhi, that we will be crushed. I cannot help thinking that when we take this aspect of the matter along with others already mentioned that Mr. Gandhi himself does not consider this as any effective step towards the attainment
U|| of the 'Parliamentary Swaraj,' but only to attain his "Spiritual Swaraj." This explains what he is so fond of reiterating that when Lajpatrai, Motilal Nehru, and C. R. Das and others were arrested and went to Jail without complaint, or resistance denying the jurisdiction of the courts, in pursuance of the policy of non-violent non-co-operation, though Parliamentary Swaraj was not attained, the spiritual 'Swaraj' of which he was in search has been attained to his intense satisfaction. If he had advocated abstention from schools, boycott of {80} Councils and Courts, non-violence as a means of attaining his (spiritual) Swaraj, giving up Punjab Khilafat and Parliamentary Home Rule, no one would perhaps have any right to complain, and it would have been a straightforward and honest course. But he has adopted underhand methods which appear to me, unless a satisfactory explanation is given, little short of dishonest and fraudulent.
U||But it may be asked whether anybody would have accepted a policy of non-violent non-co-operation in the circumstances of the case unless there was some reasonable prospect of success within any measurable time. Here we come to the most sinister aspect of the matter. In moving his resolution on non-co-operation in the National Congress held at Calcutta in September 1920, he said, "If there is sufficient response to my scheme I make bold to reiterate my statement that you can gain Swarajya in the course of an year" and he laid down certain conditions, the more important of which have been mentioned. That period has been extended subsequently by a few months. Even that extended period has elapsed. When charged with his failure to attain Parliamentary Swaraj {81} within the period asked for by him he had effrontery to state that the conditions mentioned by him have not been complied with. A political leader has no right to put forward before the country any scheme under conditions which he has no reasonable beli
U||ef of being likely to be complied with. Did he honestly believe that those conditions named by him would be complied with and Parliamentary Swaraj obtained within the time mentioned by him? Looking to the nature of the conditions I do not think he believed that they would be complied with, not only in one year but at any time; and even if complied with I have no doubt he did not believe that Swaraj would come though he might assert the contrary. He put the lure forward simply for the purpose of persuading the Congress to make an important change in the policy which the country had hitherto adopted. The National Congress, carried away by its hostility towards Government, accepted his programme. Some of the younger men may have believed in it. The older and the most experienced I have no doubt never believed in its possibility but considered it a means, of rousing the people of the country from their {82} political lethargy, to put pressure on the Government for further and more extensive reforms. They may als
U||o have felt that this might be a means of Mahomedan co-operation for their policy. I do not deny that according to English political life this is a perfectly legitimate manoeuvre though none of those leaders believed in the soundness of the policy put forward by Mr. Gandhi and many of them said so.
U||Having attained his purpose by a representation, the truth of which I cannot help thinking he did not believe, and could not have believed, and having committed the Congress to a certain course of action, he is now able to carry the Congress with him for revolutionary action, as it finds it has gone too far on this course to revert to its own natural methods of progress. But as a matter of fact he went further than this.
U||On 29th December, 1920, i.e. three months after the change of programme, he said, "my experience during the last months fills me with the hope that within the nine months that remain of the year in which I have expected Swaraj for India we shall redress the two {83} wrongs and we shall see Swaraj (Parliamentary) established in accordance with the wishes of the people of India." But I do not think for a moment he believed what he said. He used these words to dupe the people of India to follow him yet a step further and to pay him money. After about a month on the 21st of January 1921—he again confirmed his previous statement. He said: "Four months of this one year have already gone by and my faith has never burnt as brightly as it burns tonight as I am talking to the young men of Bengal." And he added "that in case of his death before the expiry of eight months he is satisfied that the people of India will secure Swaraj before the year is out." Is this not a definite statement that the Indian people are goi
U||ng to get Swaraj? A few days later the purpose comes out. In a public address to the merchants of Calcutta on the 30th January, 1921, he said:—
U||"What I purposed to do I can accomplish in a certain line. I Must attain Swaraj. If thirty crores of people say that they are not with me yet I shall do my work and win Swaraj.... If you wish to accomplish work of thirty crores of men then come out with your money. Try to have money and ask me to give an account of {84} the same. I appoint some one treasurer.... If you know that you yourself can not attain Swaraj then help one with money. If you do not help with money Swaraj will be difficult but not impossible to attain. If the students of India do not help, me it does not matter. If the pleaders do not help, it does not matter."
U||The old conditions of the boycott of schools and of the courts as conditions indispensable for the attainment of Swaraj are dropped. And he promises Swaraj and asks for money for getting it in nine months. He collected money on the faith of that representation. Earlier on the same day he got ten thousand rupees, and on the spot a large sum is said to have been collected. On the same date in addressing the students he said: "If the response continues as it has begun there is no doubt of Swaraj coming within the time prescribed". On the 23rd February 1921 he again said: "Last five months experience has confirmed me in the opinion. I am convinced that the country has never been so ready for establishing Swaraj as now." To me only one conclusion is possible that he was collecting the money from the people who understood him to say that Swaraj will be attained within the period mentioned by him. In March he said:—
U||{85} "The last Congress has given a constitution whose working in itself calculated to lead to Swaraj. It is intended to secure in every part of India representative committees working in conjunction with, and under willing and voluntary submission to a central organisation—The all India Congress Committee. It establishes an adult suffrage open to men and women subject only to two qualifications signing of the creed and a nominal payment of four annas. It is intended to secure due representation of the parties and communities, if then, it is honestly worked, and commands confidence and respect, it can oust the present Government without the slightest difficulty. For, the latter has no power except through the co-operation willing or forced, of the people. The force it exercises is almost through our own people. One lac of Europeans, without our help, can only hold less than one seventh of our villages each and it would be difficult for a man even when physically present, to impose his will on, say four hun
U||dred men and women—the average population of Indian village."
U||He said that we have therefore to concentrate our attention up to the 30th of June on getting:—
U||(1) One crore of rupees for Tilak Swaraj Fund.
U||(2) One crore members on the Congress register.
U||(3) The spinning wheel introduced in twenty lacs of homes.
U||He added, however:—
U||{86} "This programme does not mean cessation of the other activities of Non-co-operation. They go on. Drink and untouchability must vanish. The education movement is steadily going forward. The National institutions that have sprung up will, if they are efficiently managed make headway and attract students who are still hesitating. The pleaders, always a cautious and calculating class by training, will, as they see the movement progressing more and more, fall in line with the rest of the country. Boycott of law courts by the public is making fair progress. These things do not now require concentration of universal effort. They apply to special classes. But the three things mentioned by me are the most essential: they must be done now and without them the movement, as a mass movement must be pronounced a failure." "Young India" 30th March.
U||After this it is impossible to rely upon boycott of schools &c. as conditions for Swaraj within a year. It is now admitted and the Secretaries report that the money demanded has been collected. Such money was paid on the fraudulent representation of Swaraj within the year. Judged by ordinary standards Mr. Gandhi's whole procedure with the promises, the persuasions, the evasions, the subterfuges and all the other manœuvres, would be characterised by men of the world and {87} of sane judgment in language, I hesitate to reproduce, for the simple reason that I believe that Mr. Gandhi is honest in his self hypnotisation. I believe he does not really know what he is doing. At least this is the only possible charitable assumption when we watch his feats of political acrobatics which have the power of deluding such vast numbers of people making them passionately intolerant, violently intolerant often, of the slightest criticism of their hero.
U||When the Congress was asked in September to change its policy, Mr. Gandhi's idea to start an organisation to supercede the existing Government was not brought before them. It is the first direct step in the path of revolution. His followers have been by this time brought to a proper frame of mind. The use of the money to be collected was, as stated on the 13th April, to be as follows; "The only activity involving financial obligations is that of spinning, organising national service, in some cases supporting lawyers, who might have suspended practice and cannot be included in the national service as for supporting national educational institutions." {88} It will now be understood why some lawyers were willing to suspend practice. Before the expiry of one year period however other conditions were imposed which would put off Swaraj practically for a very long time to come, the removal of untouchability of the lower classes in India without which it was said Swaraj would be a meaningless term. This means, as I 
U||have no doubt, Mr. Gandhi knew, he was putting off Swaraj indefinitely. If this had been mentioned as condition when the Congress was asked to change its policy it is very doubtful whether he would have got the Congress to agree with him. As to these two conditions themselves they are admirable. With a little tact the Government might turn the tables on Mr. Gandhi. If proof of untouchability consists only in the admission of the boys of these classes to schools of higher classes, it does not mean much, though it is a notable advance. If a contact with a low class person is placed on the same footing as contact with caste man it may be said that we have got rid of untouchability. But this will not come throughout the greater portion of India for years. On {89} these questions the education of Mr. Gandhi has only commenced. He will find that without abrogating the ceremonial law on which the caste system rests there will be no practical reform. He is apparently not aware of the far more heinous custom of dista
U||nce pollution, i.e. not only pollution by touch but by approach within a certain distance. This far from being a move against Government would support the Government contention against reform.
U||About temperance also the move is salutary. If the system of picketing adopted by the volunteers is abandoned and peaceful persuasion alone is attempted no one has any right to complain. What all this has to do with Parliamentary Swaraj or Home Rule one finds it difficult to understand. But they are necessary for the 'Gandhi Swaraj' advocated in his 'Indian Home Rule', and I have little doubt that like his other proposals they were intended to attain that object.
U||It is admitted in the Report of the Secretaries that the crore of Rupees which was required to be collected, as stated above, has been realised. About the middle of July {90} he said he still looked forward before the next meeting of the Congress for the satisfaction of his demands about the Punjab and the Khilafat and full immediate Swaraj in accordance with the wishes of her chosen representatives. August and September were devoted to the campaign of burning foreign cloth which in his view was an act of non-violent non-co-operation with the Government. This step appeared unintelligible and inaccurate to his followers who believed bona fide that he was striving for political control. But it is quite consistent with and in pursuance of his scheme of spiritual swaraj of sacrifice and self-control. On the 27th of October Mr. Gandhi speaks of his "threat to seek the shelter of the Himalayas should violence become universal in India, and should it not have engulfed me."
U||As New India points out: "that would be interesting to know when this threat was made. We all know that Mr. Gandhi said that if there was violence he would go to the Himalayas. There was a riot, but he did not go, but excused himself by saying that if it occurred a second time, he would go. A second riot occurred; he said nothing but did not go. Now we hear that he had made a threat to go, should it become universal in India. When and where was this said?"
U||{91} Towards the end of the month the Times of India observed:—
U||"Writing in the latest issue of Navajivan, his Gujarati newspaper, Mr. Gandhi makes the interesting announcement that if Swaraj is not obtained by December, he will either die of a broken heart or retire from public life, leaving the heedless people of India to their resources. Were so clear a pronouncement by any other politician, we could say definitely that when the new year dawns Mr. Gandhi will no longer be actively engaged in politics!"
U||Can there be any possible doubt that all these statements were made by him in order to impress upon his dupes the fact that they were going to get Swaraj within a year and to deceive his followers to follow him and finance him. Yet what was the situation! Almost every item in his programme has been tried and found useless to attain Home Rule. I would again draw attention to the speech of the President of the Thana District conference for a review of the situation as it then stood in the opinion of one of his prominent followers, (App. VI). This is the opinion of most of his prominent supporters who have been opposing Mr. Gandhi's programme from the very beginning and accordingly the programme was practically shelved and at the Congress {92} held at the end of the year it was resolved to suspend all the activities of the Congress on which stress was much laid. The programme of the volunteer organisation throughout the country was to be carried out on a more extensive scale and the laws of the country were to 
U||be defied by disobeying the notifications issued by Government. The Congress also recommended civil disobedience as the only civilised and effective substitute for an armed rebellion and recommended individual disobedience as well as mass civil disobedience when the mass of the people have been sufficiently trained in the practice of non-violence. And the activities of the Congress were to be suspended for that purpose (App. XX). "Offensive civil disobedience herein recommended is thus defined. Offensive civil disobedience means deliberate and wilful breach of State made non-moral laws—that is, laws the breach of which does not involve moral turpitude—not for the purpose of securing the repeal of, or relief from hardships arising from obedience to such laws, but for the purpose of diminishing the authority of, or overthrowing, the State."
U||{93} What took place at the Congress itself was remarkable. The President of the Moslem League, Moulana Hajrat Mohini, who was also a member of the National Congress, proposed his resolution for complete independence. He is reported to have said that although last year they have been promised Swaraj, the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs within a year, they had so far achieved nothing (App. XVIII for his view). Mr. Gandhi denied that there was any limitation of one year when the creed was accepted in Nagpur and Calcutta. The special representative of the Congress organ, the Bombay Chronicle says: "The feeling in general appear to be in favour of Moulana Hajrat Mohini's resolution" though it was not carried on account of the passionate appeal of Mahatma Gandhi against it. It is instructive to read the resolutions (Appendix XX) that were then passed. Thus Swaraj was to come on September 1-1921, October 31-1921, December 13-1921. At the Congress in December, 1921, Mr. Gandhi gave up fixing any date 
U||for the attainment of Swaraj.
U||The resolution passed in September, 1920, was seditious. The resolution passed in December, {94} 1921, is openly revolutionary, and in fact Gandhi made no secret of it. He says: "Lord Reading must clearly understand that the non-co-operators are at war with the Government. They have declared rebellion against it in as much as it has committed a breach of faith with the Mussalmans. It has humiliated the Punjab and insists upon imposing its will upon the people and refuses to repair the breach and repent for the wrong done in the Punjab" (Young India). Mr. Gandhi also said: "The Government want to goad us into violence or abject surrender. We must do neither. We must retort by such civil disobedience as would compel shooting." The volunteer organizations were pledged to act accordingly. Yet when the Government notified those illegal associations and punished those who defied them, the rebels indignantly remonstrate against what they call coercion and interference with the liberty of person and security of prop
U||erty. They want to be in the limelight to evoke the admiration of America and Europe for their patriotism in rebelling against a Satanic Government. But they are wanting in the {95} redeeming features of these rebels elsewhere—their contempt of danger and death. That is left here to the ignorant masses—the dupes of these men who seek to protect themselves from danger by their doctrine of non-violence.
U||{96}
U||NON-VIOLENT NON-CO-OPERATION
U||How on earth is it possible to imagine that all activities would be non-violent when those who are carrying them on proclaim themselves rebels against constitutional authority and are bent upon destroying it; when they say that they must commit civil disobedience of a character that would compel the officials to shoot them! when we know that one large section of it, the Mahomedans, follow a militant religion which not only sanctions but requires them to use force to vindicate what they consider to be their religious law. When we consider further the nature of the activities of those who carry on the Non-co-operation movement there can be still less room to doubt that riots ending in bloodshed are bound to follow. In order to carry out the Non-co-operation campaign India is divided into various Congress provinces. Congress committees are formed consisting of members who {97} are also pledged to carry out the Congress principles: there are also volunteer organizations formed. The function of these bodies is to
U|| impress upon the people of the country the enormity of Government's crime with reference to the Punjab and the Khilafat and the consequent necessity of Home Rule or Swaraj. For attaining such Swaraj they advocate progressive non-co-operation by "peaceful" methods. Such methods consist of various steps which are described in the speech of Mr. Macpherson, extracted below. Starting, perhaps, peacefully they soon exhibit a tendency to violence and when Mahomedan sentiments are involved, when appeals are made to Mahomedan religious feelings, that tendency becomes almost irresistible in their case. Opposition to constituted authority inflames them into violence and instead of submitting to violence at the hands of authorities according to the dictates of Gandhi—a counsel of perfection—they retort—and murder is the result. The process is so well put by Mr. Macpherson in the Behar Legislative Council that I take the liberty of quoting the following extract from his speech:—
U||"It is necessary to consider what is the essence of {98} the non-co-operation movement, what are its ultimate objects and what are its methods. From the moment Mr. Gandhi first unfolded his plan of campaign—that was, I think, at a Benares or Allahabad Conference in 1920—there has never been any doubt in my mind that the objects of the movement were entirely unconstitutional, that its methods were illegal and that its prosecution to the bitter end is bound to result in violence, disorder and anarchy, however much non-violence may be proclaimed as the watchword of its leaders. The movement cannot be judged by its earlier and comparatively innocuous stages, as if these stood by themselves. I refer to the resignation of titles, the boycott of Government schools and colleges, the abandonment of their profession by legal practitioners and other such manifestations of non-co-operation, although all these items in the programme have done an infinite amount of harm, especially to the youth of the country, and eve
U||n these earlier stages have been marked by repeated outbursts of violence, by a concerted system of intimidation and social boycott, and by the excitement of racial hatred which has had deplorable results in individual cases. No, the plan of campaign must be taken as a whole, and judged by its closing stages, the enforcement of civil disobedience towards the laws of the country, interference with the police and the judicial administration, the invasion of police stations, picketing of Courts, the seduction of the troops from their allegiance, and the refusal to pay taxes or rent or revenue. The movement must indeed {99} be judged by its ultimate object, which is the paralysis and subversion of the existing Government and by its inevitable result, general disorder and bloodshed and widespread misery amongst all classes and communities. If pursued to the bitter end, it will assuredly have this result, whether it succeeds or fails, and should it (which God forbid) succeed, the end can only be a state of chaos w
U||hich will make India the prey of the violent tribes that dwell around her borders or the hungry hordes of Central Asia who, in the course of history, have more than once invaded India. The object of the movement being what it is, the overthrow of the existing Government in India, what is the use of telling us that either its leaders or its followers have signed a pledge of non-violence? The pledge is a farce, it has already been broken a hundred times over, and the longer the movement continues and the further it advances, the more it will be broken."
U||That this has been the case is illustrated by almost all the riots which have taken place. Malabar stands first in its unenviable notoriety. There the Congress committees were formed; the Khilafat committees also were formed; Gandhi and Shaukat Ali visited Malabar, preached their sermons and the usual result followed. With Mahomedans Swaraj was only their secondary aim, their principal object being the redress of the Khalif's wrongs and {100} the establishment of a Khilafat kingdom in the country. When, therefore, the British Government interfered with the activities of some of the Khilafat leaders the Mohomedan population as a whole rose in rebellion and invited the Hindus to join them. The Hindus as a body remained loyal; and the results were disastrous both to the Mahomedans and to the Hindus, more than two thousand Mahomedans killed by troops according to official estimates, thousands more in other ways; far larger numbers wounded; the number of Hindus butchered in circumstances of barbarity, flayed aliv
U||e, made to dig their own graves before slaughter, running into thousands; women and purdah women too, raped, not in a fit of passion but systematically for months passed from hand to hand and with calculated revolting and horrible cruelty for which I have not been able to find a parallel in history. Thousands were forcibly converted. All this done in the name of, and to enforce, the Khilafat movement: all this due directly to the visit of Gandhi and Shaukat Ali and to the organization of Khilafat associations. They carried on their activities openly without any {101} obstruction by the authorities; the Government of Madras was prevented from interfering with Khilafat agitators by the Government of India who are therefore as responsible as if they had directly ordered all this frightfulness.
U||I take the United Provinces next and will refer not only to the activities of the volunteers but to the entire situation as it developed itself from the commencement of the year 1921. That will also show the earnest efforts which were made by the Government to co-operate with the constitutional party to work the Reform Scheme in a sympathetic spirit.
U||In welcoming the Legislative Council on the 22nd of January, 1921, Sir Harcourt Butler drew attention to the great efforts which were being made by Mr. Gandhi's party to achieve their objects, to their aim, to their failure till that time to achieve any appreciable success (App. VII). By March the situation had become worse and he narrated the circumstances which compelled him to extend the Seditious Meetings Act to some of the districts (App. VIII). By the end {102} of the year the situation became intolerable. Sir Harcourt Butler has described the efforts of the Non-co-operators, and the success they have achieved, in his speech on the 17th December 1921 (App. IX).
U||And finally Sir Ludovic Porter, a member of the Government, described the whole situation, including the various efforts that were being made by the Non-co-operators on the 23rd of January 1922 (App. X). This will explain also the nature of the associations of volunteers formed under the Resolution of the Congress already referred to, their efforts and their illegal character. And more recently we now hear of far more serious disturbances in Gorakhpur where a mob of volunteers and villagers about 2000 in number led by the former killed 21 policemen and chowkidars (App. XII) and at Rai Bareilly where there was a serious collision. In order to understand the modus operandi I give an official narrative of the events at Barabanki (App. XI). About Behar we have the speech of Mr. Macpherson, a member of Council, in which he refers to the plans of the non-co-operation {103} party to win Swaraj, gives the organization of the national volunteers describes how the Government offices were to be taken possession of, civ
U||il disobedience was to be started, gives the deplorable conditions in various districts brought about by the non-co-operation campaign and describes the revolutionary character of the movement in that province (App. XVI). The chief secretary, Mr. Hammond, in his speech gives various instances of tyranny practised by the non-co-operation volunteers, a practical speech which proves his contention (App. XVII). In Bengal, on Nov. 20 Lord Ronaldshay drew attention to the nature of Gandhi Swaraj and Turkish administration (App. XIII). In Nov. 1921, he spoke about the intended boycott of the Prince of Wales (App. XIII). In another speech he pointed out the lies that were being spread about the bombardment of Mecca (App. XIII). In Dec. 1921, he described the activities which led to the interference of Government. A brief extract will be found in (App. XII). Finally, in Feb. 1922, he made a lengthy reference to the political outlook (App. XIII). In the Legislative Council Sir Henry Wheeler a member {104} of Governmen
U||t described the situation (App. XV).
U||In the Legislative Assembly also the matter was fully discussed in Jan. 1922. Sir William Vincent summed up the situation, various instances of their activities among which will be found a particularly revolting statement about the corpse of a diseased person who was loyal to the Government, and therefore obnoxious to Gandhi's party, being dug out of the grave (App. XXIII).
U||This completes my review of the situation. Considerations of space have compelled me to exclude many speeches which would throw further light on the situation.
U||I will, therefore, content myself with giving a list of the disturbances and riots throughout India, due to Gandhi's movement supplied to me by the Legislative Department of the Government of India (App. XXII).
U||In February 1922 Mr. Gandhi issued an ultimatum to the Government of India that if within a certain period of time his demands formulated in his ultimatum were not conceded he would start what is called mass civil disobedience at Bardoli, that is to say, the people {105} of Bardoli would be asked to refuse to pay taxes etc. The Government of India issued a communique in reply in which reviewing the situation they pointed out the grave dangers that would follow such civil disobedience and gave him a stern warning (App. XIX).
U||This attitude no doubt surprised him. The Government he thought was on the run, when they had submitted meekly to his contemptuous refusal for a conference at Calcutta and he had apparently therefore expected them to beg for an armistice. There was a remarkable change. He or rather the working committee of the Congress suspended mass civil disobedience having found a pretext in the occurrence of a riot about this time at Gorakhpur. So far as the campaign against the Government is concerned the following are the important resolutions:—
U||"The working Committee of the Congress resolves that mass civil disobedience contemplated at Bardoli and elsewhere be suspended and instructs the local Congress Committees forthwith to advise the cultivators to pay the land revenue and other taxes due to the Government and whose payment might have been suspended in anticipation of mass civil disobedience and instructs them to suspend every other preparatory activity of an offensive nature." "The suspension of mass civil disobedience {106} shall be continued till the atmosphere is so non-violent as to ensure the non-repetition of popular atrocities such as at Gorakhpur, or hooliganism such as at Bombay and Madras respectively on the 17th November, 1921 and 13th January last. In order to promote a peaceful atmosphere the working Committee advises till further instruction, all Congress organisations to stop activities specially designed to court arrest and imprisonment, save normal Congress activities including voluntary hartals wherever an absolutely peaceful 
U||atmosphere can be assured, and for that end all picketing shall be stopped save for the bona fide and peaceful purpose of warning the visitors to liquor shops against the evils of drinking. Such picketing to be controlled by persons of known good character and specially selected by the Congress Committee concerned."
U||"The working Committee advises, till further instructions, the stoppage of all volunteer processions and public meetings merely for the purpose of defiance of the notification regarding such meetings. This, however, shall not interfere with the private meetings of the Congress and other committees or public meetings which are required for the conduct of the normal activities of the Congress".
U||The working Committee advised all Congress organisations to be engaged in the following activities:—
U||"To enlist at least one crore of members of the Congress. The workers should note that no one who does not pay the annual subscription can be regarded as a qualified congressman." {107}
U||"To continue the Swaraj fund and to call upon every Congressman or Congress-sympathiser to pay at least one hundredth part of his annual income for the year 1921. Every province to send every month 25 per cent of its income from the Tilak Memorial Swaraj fund to the All-India Congress Committee."
U||The above resolutions were directed to be placed before the All-India Congress Committee for revision if necessary. They were accordingly brought before the All-India Congress Committee whose Resolution runs thus.
U||"The All-India Congress Committee have carefully considered the resolutions passed by the Working Committee at its meeting held at Bardoli on the 11th and 12th instant, confirms the said resolutions with the modifications noted herein and further resolves that individual civil disobedience whether of a defensive or aggressive character, may be commenced in respect of particular places or particular laws, at the instance of, and upon permission being granted therefore, by the respective provincial Committee.
U||"Provided that such civil disobedience shall not be permitted unless all the conditions laid down by the Congress or the All-India Congress Committee or the Working Committee are strictly fulfilled.
U||"Reports having been received from various quarters that picketing regarding foreign cloth is as necessary as liquor picketing, the All-India Congress Committee {108} authorises such picketing of a bona fide character on the same terms as liquor picketing mentioned in the Bardoli resolutions.
U||"The All-India Congress Committee wishes it to be understood that the resolutions of the Working Committee do not mean an abandonment of the original Congress programme of non-co-operation or the permanent abandonment of mass civil disobedience, but considers that an atmosphere of necessary mass non-violence can be established by the workers concentrating upon the constructive programme framed by the Working committee at Bardoli. The All-India Congress Committee holds civil disobedience to be the right and duty of the people to be exercised and performed whenever the State opposed the declared will of the people."
U||{109}
U||INDIVIDUAL CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
U||Note.—Individual civil disobedience is disobedience of orders or laws by a single individual or an ascertained number or group of individuals. Therefore, a prohibited public meeting where admission is regulated by tickets and to which no unauthorised admission is allowed, is an instance of individual civil disobedience whereas a prohibited meeting to which the general public is admitted without any restriction, is an instance of mass civil disobedience.
U||Such civil disobedience is defensive, when a prohibited public meeting is held for conducting a normal activity although it may result in arrest. It would be aggressive, if it is held, not for any activity, but merely for the purpose of courting arrest and imprisonment.
U||This shows that there is practically no change in the situation. This may be read with the resolution of the congress 28th Dec. 1921 (App. XX). Gandhi's agitation continues revolutionary.
U||For more than thirty years the constitutional Reform party have been fighting for various indispensable reforms in the administration of {110} the country with but moderate success. At last however, in 1919 they obtained a Reform scheme which brought India directly on to the path leading to Home Rule. In fact the Reform Act made Home Rule inevitable within a comparatively short time, and indicated the nature of the constitutional methods of its early attainment. Mr. Gandhi was in India for some years before that date. He scarcely lent any assistance to the Reform party. Considering his principles he could not. After having obtained the Act, the Reform party proceeded to work it, to carry out the administrative reforms needed, to educate the masses to enable them to claim and exercise larger political powers, in order to claim at as early a date as possible that further instalment of Reform provided for and contemplated in the act itself. Mr. Gandhi is standing right athwart their path, thus preventing or at 
U||least retarding and dangerously imperilling the indispensable reforms, regardless of the sufferings of the people entailed thereby, in order to carry out his own wild principles which have not the slightest chance of acceptance provided they are understood {111} by the people of the country for what they are, emotional speculations without any considered relation to existing conditions. Mr. Gandhi, to take him at his best is indifferent to facts. Facts must submit to the dictates of his theories. The only difficulty in his way is that they don't. Will o'the wisp politics are not of use to a people who have to live in a world which, from long and bitter experience, has at last come to realise that dreams of distorted brains are not the stuff of which contented Nations are made. Gandhi in fact is seeking not only to destroy the fruits of the long endeavour of the constitutional reformers, but blast for ever any hopes of Indian regeneration.
U||To push forward the working of the Act has been the work before the Reform party which he is thus so perniciously thwarting. They had to take up in the Legislative Councils the question of the redress of the grievances under which the people suffered, not only to agitate for their removal, but to show the people that by constitutional agitation sooner or later they can get what they want. The most important question with which the constitutional Reformers had to deal {112} was one concerning the great poverty of the country. For this it is necessary to consider the question of the Land Tax—its nature, incidents, relation to other taxes, its necessity, the distribution of the land produce between the Government and the classes that own the land. This is a question in which the landholding classes are very much interested. They would have understood the arguments addressed to them and therefore it would have served as a means of political and social education. The Councils have already been dealing with it, 
U||and, considering the conditions, satisfactorily. The Government have been meeting them in a sympathetic spirit and are trying to give effect to their proposals as much as possible. What is Mr. Gandhi's advice? He does not seek to co-operate to make the tax less oppressive. He would have the people pay no land tax to Government. Only the dreadful consequences that would ensue prevent him in this case, from giving full effect to his intentions. In any case, it is not the oppressive nature of the tax that he relies on, nor is it alleged that it is an innovation of the British Government, which of course {113} it is not. He objects to the tax, not for itself, but because it is another weapon with which to destroy the Government.
U||A cognate question is that which arises between the landlords and tenants. In this also all the landholding classes are deeply interested, and a discussion of the nature of the distribution of the produce between the landlord, farmer and agricultural labourer would have been of great educative value. The Legislative Councils are dealing with the question. Government in this matter also are showing the greatest possible consideration for the feelings of the people of the country. Yet Mr. Gandhi and his friends would not only take no part in the deliberations of the council but would prevent an amicable settlement by steps which have produced riots between the classes interested in the land, with the object of discrediting the Reform Scheme and paralysing the Government of the country.
U||Closely connected with this is the question of Indian manufactures, industries and the development of mineral resources, which, besides, conferring other benefits, will relieve undue pressure on the land. Our industries have been {114} destroyed by English competition and constitutional reformers are determined to take all the steps necessary to enter into healthy competition with English industries in Indian interests and to develop their own mineral and other resources. In so doing they have to take care that the conditions which accompanied the rise of industrial prosperity in the West are not reproduced in India. They have to see that wage earners received adequate protection. What are the tactics of Mr. Gandhi and his friends? All these industries are to him the devil's-own agency to destroy the soul. He says they cannot add an inch to India's moral stature. Starvation due to the absence of industries may destroy the body and certainly hinders the development of the soul. But to him this does not matter
U||. He and his followers would taboo machinery, without which competition or development is hopeless. Without attempting to promote an amicable settlement between English capitalists and Indian labourers they have on the contrary been responsible for a deliberate widening of the chasm between the races.
U||{115} The administration of justice is another matter in which all are interested; and already the Legislative Councils are dealing with the question of the separation of Judicial and Executive functions. The Government again are not only not standing in their way but are rendering every assistance towards the solution of the problem. This is also the case with reference to the removal of discriminations between Europeans and Indians in the administration of justice. The people of the country understand this question well as they are deeply interested in it. Mr. Gandhi is asking the people of the country to avoid all courts and thus not to interest themselves in the improvement of judicial administration.
U||I might take many other questions relating to finances, army, etc., and show the baneful influence of his propaganda. In all these Mr. Gandhi's campaign against Government has hampered the reformers who would otherwise have made the redress of these grievances a more effective plank in their platform; these questions would have been more widely discussed throughout the country. But such discussion is now almost impossible with the {116} result that these questions are not settled as satisfactorily as they might otherwise be. But it is as regards education that the reformers have most felt the want of that popular support necessary to carry out the reforms needed.
U||Mr. Gandhi will never be forgiven by all true lovers of sound National Education for India for the campaign he has carried on against real education. The education that has been hitherto imparted had been as everybody, including Mr. Gandhi also recognised, lamentably defective. The reformers had to insist on the imparting of suitable primary education to the masses, to the workers, to the labouring men and others, to enable them to improve their condition, because no class can generally rise except under the ultimate stress of its own will and ability. They had to demand suitable higher education, which was required not only in the interests of the culture but also for the industrial regeneration of the country and for the development of India's natural resources. In the laboratories of Europe, America and Japan students are devoting themselves to discover means for the alleviation of misery and pain. Nay, higher claims are advanced, {117} for it has been declared by scientists that we are on the eve of disc
U||overy of means for a practically indefinite prolongation of life under certain conditions which make us intensely expectant to know whether they are the same as described in our ancient books as efficacious for that purpose, descriptions which have hitherto been contemptuously discarded as worthless. Archaeologists are almost every day unveiling to us ancient remains and writings which give us a different and a startling conception of ancient History and Civilisation. Indian History is being rewritten. When we hear of the Marconi wireless, our young men turn to our own ancient descriptions of the training of human body and mind which make these fit to receive and convey messages regardless of space and distance and they show eagerness to take part in experiment and research. When we find rays penetrating solid matter, our young scientists wonder whether after all the stories of great seers whose vision, not of the material eye, is not bounded by time or space or distance, may not be true and wonder whether w
U||e should not now take up the training prescribed to attain those results. Researches are made {118} in the laboratories to control the forces of nature, to increase human comforts and happiness, to increase productivity in all directions. Researches have already attained brilliant results. The lessons of the survey of the regions above by the telescope, of all below by the microscope, and generally speaking all these marvels of science which lend fresh light and new significance to the lesson of ancients as to the all pervading of the universe are all anathema to Mr. Gandhi.
U||He wants to hold back our boys from the Universities and post-graduate studies and research that they may go back to their ploughs while the Universities of the Western world are sending their delegates all over the world to take stock of what has been done and to devise means for the intellectual and moral uplift of the Nations.
U||The constitutional reformers and the Councils have the great task before them of reconciling the Hindus and Mahomedans on a basis for their unity other than the one which arose out of the Mahomedan fury against the British Government for its failure to support Mahomedan interests in the West. {119} They have also to promote goodwill between the Hindus and the Mahomedans on the one side and the Europeans on the other, both in India and in the colonies. They have to face the rising antagonism between the dark, the fair and the white—an antagonism which threatens in course of time to engulf the whites with all that modern civilisation, whatever be its faults, is standing for. The Reform party want India to take her rightful place in the Indo-British commonwealth, the first place, in fact, to which her natural genius and her resources entitle her, with all its responsibilities. The conditions are all favourable to India. Governorships of Provinces are thrown open to Indians. There are Indians in the Viceroy's 
U||and other Councils. But Mr. Gandhi and his friends will not only do practically nothing in that direction but they have created what threatens to be a permanent gulf between the Mahomedans and non-Mahomedans, and they are dangerously widening the gulf between the Indians and Europeans. The reformers have to improve the conditions of women both amongst the Mahomedans and the Hindus, as without such improvement India is not entitled {120} to take her place among civilised nations. They have practically to get rid of the caste system as with such a cancer political progress is impossible. Mr. Gandhi, on the other hand, panders to Mahomedan vanity and justifies the racial differences as between different classes of Hindus. He insists upon the necessity of our going back to our own caste system, which is responsible for the condition of our women and of the lower classes. He has given a handle to those who want to maintain the repressive laws, and is really responsible for the retention of them. He has not only t
U||hrown doubts as to our fitness for Self-Government but has rendered it possible for our opponents to urge with plausibility that danger would accrue to the Empire and to India itself by granting Home Rule to India. He has thus to the best of his sinister ability attempted to prevent all reforms and has tried to paralyse all the efforts of the reformers in every direction, fomenting racial and class differences, as I have already explained.
U||Everywhere we see a class of narrow thought in the white world raising the colour sentiment against the Asiatics, and against {121} Indians in particular, proclaiming that there is no place for Indians in British Empire on terms of equality. These are not the intellectual leaders of the white races, nor are they those who set the best standards of morality. On the other hand, we see the noblest of them proclaiming and striving with all their might, with varying degrees of success, to enforce the opposite ideal. We know also that in India the question is only one of time and within a short period absolute equality in every respect will be carried out. We see further that our countrymen elsewhere are weak and comparatively helpless, and till we in India attain our manhood they must continue at the mercy of the white races. What is it, then, that not only Religion, Universal morality, or good, but also policy and prudence, dictate? There can be only one answer. We must strengthen the hands of those who are figh
U||ting for race equality and give no opportunity to those who maintain that the Indians are a peril to the white race. What is Mr. Gandhi doing? He is doing everything possible to increase racial and class hatred.
U||We see the wonderful phenomenon of {122} Australian ladies begging pardon for the atrocious treatment of their Indian sisters by a few Englishmen in Fiji and elsewhere. We see the Universities and Professors, ashamed of themselves for their aberration during the great War, hastening to make amends by trying to bring together all classes and races of men. We see white women trying to band themselves and other women of whatever colour and creed into one sisterhood, without any difference, to throw themselves into all social and political movements for sex enfranchisement and uplift; to work for the good not only of themselves but of children in particular, and generally to devote themselves to all activities of mercy. We find various Nations calling to one another across seas, deserts and mountains to join in a common fellowship, not to work in opposition to one another. Every where, after the fearful cataclysm through which we have passed, there is wistful yearning for fellowship and brother-hood to carry out
U|| in practice the teachings of the ancient prophets and seers, Buddha, Confucius, Zoroaster, the seers of the Upanishads, Christ, Mahomed, in opposition to the Churches and the dogmatic {123} religions identified with their names. And is it not extraordinary, we see this man, uninfluenced by this tremendous intellectual and moral up-heaval, waging a bloody and racial struggle for what? that if successful Indians may not take part in any of these movements, shun them all, since God has not created man with his limited means of natural locomotion to labour for general good, and may therefore, retire to their village to lead a solitary life.
U||If he had followed this advice for himself, or had retired to the Himalayas to live a mahatmaic life he would have saved the lives literally of thousands, prevented horrible outrages worse than death, saved thousands from incalculable misery. Instead of paying the penalty themselves, he and his lieutenants stalk about the country dripping with the blood of the victims of their policy.
U||Who is responsible for all this? The Government of India cannot divest themselves of their responsibility and India will hold the Indian members primarily responsible for the present situation. For no Viceroy will venture to disregard their advice in a matter of this sort. They do not seem to have strengthened {124} the fibre of the Government. Nor have the Legislative Councils who also must share the responsibility advanced the claim for the transfer of the administration of justice to popular control. The Gandhi movement will no doubt collapse by internal disruption as it is composed of various elements, drawn from Tolstoy Lenin communism, socialism, Rigid Brahmanism, militant Mahomedanism mutually repellent and explosive when they come into contact with one another and already producing the natural terrible results. But before the final collapse comes it will have produced appalling misery and bloodshed unless it is dealt with firmly and with statesmanship. The Government should give Mr. Gandhi and some o
U||f his chief lieutenants who accept the whole programme the rest, they sadly need. And the Congress and the Khilafat associations must be treated as they themselves wish to be treated as disloyal illegal associations.
U||Since the above lines were written Mr. Gandhi has been arrested, tried and convicted. He pleaded guilty to the charges framed against him. His statements are worthy of careful attention (App. XXI). He said "I {125} wish to endorse all the blame that the learned Advocate-General has thrown on my shoulders in connection with the Bombay occurrences, Madras occurrences and the Chauri Chaura occurrences. Thinking over these deeply and sleeping over them night after night, it is impossible for me to dissociate myself from the diabolical crimes of Chauri Chaura or the mad outrages of Bombay." He is quite right when he says, that "as a man of responsibility, a man having received a fair share of education, having had fair share of experience of this world, I should have known the consequences of every one of my acts. I knew that I was playing with fire. I ran the risk and if I was set free I would still do the same. I have felt it this morning that I would have failed in my duty, if I did not say what I said here ju
U||st now." A man who says that if set free he would still pursue the same course though aware of the consequences of his acts is not a safe leader. There are signs however of a general recognition throughout the country that Mr. Gandhi's theories are no longer suitable as a guide for political action. The Maharashtra party have apparently resolved to seek admission into the {126} Legislative councils. The Central Provinces are also apparently of the same opinion. A large section of Bengal represented by the Chitagong conference apparently hold the same view. In Madras a considerable section is inclined to agree. But there is little doubt that it would take a long time to eradicate the feeling of hatred that has been roused by Mr. Gandhi throughout the country.
U||As I left the Government of India long before the campaign of non-co-operation was launched, perhaps there is nothing inappropriate in the few observations which I propose to make regarding the delay in taking action against Mr. Gandhi and his followers. In September 1920 the Congress adopted the non-co-operation resolution. The Government might then have taken action with the support of a large majority of Indian politicians. After the final adoption of a non-co-operation programme by the Nagpur Congress it was felt that the Government should have stopped the activities of the party which from that moment had openly declared their disloyalty. They maintained their silence however even after Gandhi and the Congress {127} party resolved on the recruitment of volunteers and the organisation of a parallel Government. On the arrest and trial of the Ali Brothers Mr. Gandhi challenged the Government to arrest him as he maintained that the conduct of the Ali Brothers in tampering with the loyalty of the Sepoys and 
U||uttering sedition was only in pursuance of the policy adopted by himself and the congress. His words are remarkable. "The National Congress began to tamper with the loyalty of the sepoys in September last year, i.e. 1920 the Central Khilafat Committee began it earlier and I began it earlier still, for I must be permitted to take the credit or the odium of suggesting, that India had a right openly to tell the sepoy and everyone who served the Government in any capacity whatsoever that he participated in the wrongs done by the Government."—"Every non-co-operator is pledged to preach disaffection towards the Government established by law. Non-co-operation, though, a religious and strictly moral movement, deliberately aims at the overthrow of the Government, and is therefore legally seditious in terms of the Indian Penal Code. But this is no new discovery. {128} Lord Chelmsford knew it. Lord Reading knows it" ... "we must reiterate from a thousand platforms the formula of the Ali Brothers regarding the sepoys,
U|| and we must spread disaffection openly and systematically till it pleases the Government to arrest us." It will hardly be believed that even after this no steps were taken against him. Towards the end of the year he said "Lord Reading must clearly understand that the non-co-operators are at war with the Government. They have declared rebellion against it." It was after this that there was an attempt to bring about a conference between him and the Government which was contemptuously brushed aside by him. One of the mopla leaders when tried for rebellion pleaded that he was under the impression that the British Government no longer ruled the country and had abdicated. There is very little doubt of the unfortunate fact that there was a general belief that the Government was powerless and could be safely defied by Gandhi and his congress.

U||APPENDIX I
U||VICEROY'S SPEECH.
U||"A few Europeans and many Hindus, have been murdered, communications have been obstructed, Government offices burnt and looted and records have been destroyed, Hindu temples sacked, houses of Europeans and Hindus burnt, according to reports Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam and one of the most fertile tracts of South India is faced with certain famine. The result has been the temporary collapse of the Civil Government, the offices and Courts have ceased to function and ordinary business has been brought to a standstill. European and Hindu refugees of all classes are concentrated at Calicut and it is satisfactory to note that they are safe there. One trembles to think of the consequences if the forces of order had not prevailed for the protection of Calicut. The non Muslim in these parts was fortunate indeed that either he or his family or his house or property came under the protection of the soldiers and the police. Those who are responsible for causing this grave outbreak of violence and crime must b
U||e brought to justice and made to suffer the punishment of the guilty.
U||Effect of violent preaching
U||"But apart from direct responsibility, can it be doubted that when poor unfortunate and deluded people are led to believe that they should disregard the law and defy authority, violence and crime must follow? This outbreak is but another instance on a much more serious scale and among a more turbulent and fanatical people, of the conditions that have manifested themselves at times {130} in various parts of the country and, gentlemen, I ask myself and you and the country generally what else can be the result from instilling such doctrines into the minds of the masses of the people? How can there be peace and tranquility when ignorant people, who have no means of testing the truth of the inflamatory and too often deliberately false statements made to them, are thus misled by those whose design is to provoke violence and disorder. Passions are thus easily excited to unreasoning fury.
U||The Leader of the Movement
U||"Although, I freely acknowledge that the leader of the movement to paralyse authority, persistently, and, as I believe, in all earnestness and sincerity, preaches the doctrine of non-violence and has even reproved his followers for resorting to it, yet again and again it has been showed that his doctrine is completely forgotten and his exhortations absolutely disregarded when passions are excited as must inevitably be the consequence among emotional people.
U||Its inevitable result
U||"To those who are responsible for the peace and good government of this great Empire and I trust that to all men of sanity and common sense in all classes of society, it must be clear that the defiance of the Government and constituted authority can only result in widespread disorder, in political chaos, in anarchy and in ruin."
U||APPENDIX II
U||DIABOLICAL ATROCITIES.
U||Calicut, Sept. 7—In my first article I dealt with the prime causes of the present outbreak, the dangerous game played by the leaders of the Khilafat and Non-Co-operation movements in Malabar which set the whole of Ernad and Walluvanad ablaze, and the extent of plunders, murders and forcible conversions committed by the Mopla rebels. In this article I intend to confine myself to the nature of the atrocities committed by them and other details.
U||{131} The experiences I am about to relate will satisfy every Hindu endowed with ordinary common sense that the Moplas resorted to most repugnant fanaticism, which may be ascribed to nothing but selfishness, love of money and love of power, which are the prominent features of the present outbreak. Refugees narrate that, after forcibly removing young and fair Nair and other high caste girls from their parents and husbands, the Mopla rebels stripped them of their clothing and made them march in their presence naked, and finally they committed rape upon them. In certain instances, devoid of human feelings and blinded by animal passion, the Moplas are alleged to have utilised a single woman for the gratification of the carnal pleasures of a dozen or more men. The rebels also seem to have captured beautiful Hindu women, forcibly converted them, pierced holes in their ears in the typical Mopla fashion, dressed them as Mopla women and utilised them as their temporary partners in life. Hindu women were threatened, m
U||olested and compelled to run half-naked for shelter to forests abounding in wild animals. Respectable Hindu gentlemen were forcibly converted and the circumcision ceremony performed with the help of certain Musaliars and Thangals. Hindu houses were looted and set fire to, will not all these atrocities remain as a shameful image of the Hindu Muslim "unity", of which we have heard much from the Non-Co-operation Party and Khilafat-wallahs? The ghastly spectacle of a number of Hindu damsels being forced to march naked in the midst of a number of licentious Moplas cannot be forgotten by any self respecting Hindu, nor can it be erased from their minds. On the other hand, I have never heard of the modesty of a Mopla woman being outraged by a Mopla rebel. "Times of India."

U||APPENDIX III
U||MALABAR'S AGONY.
U||By Annie Besant
U||It would be well if Mr. Gandhi could be taken into Malabar to see with his own eyes the ghastly horrors which have been created by the preaching of himself and his "loved brothers," Muhommad and Shaukat Ali. The Khilafat Raj is established there; on August 1, 1921, sharp to the date first announced by Mr. Gandhi for the beginning of Swaraj and the vanishing of British Rule, a Police Inspector was surrounded by Moplas, revolting against that Rule. From that date onwards thousands of the forbidden war-knives ware secretly made and hidden away, and on August 20, the rebellion broke out, Khilafat flags were hoisted on Police Stations and Government offices. Strangely enough it was on August 25th 825 A.D. that Cherman Perumal ascended the throne of Malabar, the first Zamorin, and from that day the Malayalam Era is dated that is still in use; thus for 1096 years a Zamorin has ruled in Calicut, and the Rajas are mostly Chiefs who for long centuries have looked to a Zamorin as their feudatory Head. These are the men
U|| on whom the true pacification of Malabar must ultimately depend. The crowded refugees will only return to their devastated homes when they see those once more in safety in their ancestral places. Their lands, which they keep under their own control, are largely cultivated by Moplas, who are normally hardy, industrious agricultural labourers.
U||Our correspondent has sent accounts of the public functions connected with my hurried visit to Calicut and Palghat, and that which I wish to put on record here is the ghastly misery which prevails, the heart-breaking wretchedness which has been caused by the Mopla outbreak, directly due to the violent and unscrupulous attacks on the Government made by the Non-Co-operators and the Khilafatists and the statements scattered broadcast, predicting the speedy disappearance of British Rule, and the establishment of {133} Swaraj, as proclaimed by the N.C.O. and Khilafat Raj as understood by the Moplas from the declarations of the Khilafatists. On that, there is no doubt whatever, so far as Malabar is concerned. The message of the Khilafats, of England as the enemy of Islam, of her coming downfall, and the triumph of the Muslims, had spread, to every Mopla home. The harangues in the Mosques spread it everywhere, and Muslim hearts were glad. They saw the N.C.O. preachers appealing for help to their religious leaders, 
U||naturally identified the two. The Government was Satanic, and Eblis, to the good Muslim, is to be fought to the death. Mr. Gandhi may talk as he pleases about N.C.O.s accepting no responsibility. It is not what they accept; it is what facts demonstrate. He accepted responsibility for the trifling bloodshed of Bombay. The slaughter in Malabar cries out his responsibility. N.C.O. is dead in Malabar. But bitter hatred has arisen there, as fighting men from the dragon's teeth of Theseus. That is the ghastly result of the preaching of Gandhism, of N.C.O. of Khilafatism. Every one speaks of the Khilafat Raj, and the one hope of the masses is in its crushing by the strong arm of the Government. Mr. Gandhi asks the Moderates to compel the Government to suspend hostilities, i.e., to let loose the wolves to destroy what lives are left. The sympathy of the Moderates is not, I make bold to say, with the murderers, the looters, the ravishers, who have put into practice the teachings of paralysing the Government of the N.
U||C.O.'s, who have made "war on the Government" in their own way. How does Mr. Gandhi like the Mopla spirit, as shown by one of the prisoners in the Hospital, who was dying from the results of asphyxiation? He asked the surgeon, if he was going to die, and surgeon answered that he feared he would not recover. "Well, I'm glad I killed fourteen infidels," said the Brave, God-fearing Mopla, whom Mr. Gandhi so much admires, who "are fighting for what they consider as religion, and in a manner they consider as religious." Men who consider it "religious" to murder, rape, loot, to kill women and little children, cutting down whole families, have to be put under restraint in any civilised society.
U||Mr. Gandhi was shocked when some Parsi ladies had {134} their saries torn off, and very properly, yet the God-fearing hooligans had been taught that it was sinful to wear foreign cloth, and doubtless felt they were doing a religious act; can he not feel a little sympathy for thousands of women left with only rags, driven from home, for little children born of the flying mothers on roads in refuge camps? The misery is beyond description. Girl wives, pretty and sweet, with eyes half blind with weeping, distraught with terror; women who have seen their husbands hacked to pieces before their eye, in the way "Moplas consider as religious"; old women tottering, whose faces become written with anguish and who cry at a gentle touch and a kind look waking out of a stupor of misery only to weep, men who have lost all, hopeless, crushed, desperate, I have walked among thousands of them in the refugee camps, and some times heavy eyes would lift as a cloth was laid gently on the bare shoulder, and a faint watery smile of
U|| surprise would make the face even more piteous than the stupor. Eyes full of appeal, of agonised despair, of hopeless entreaty of helpless anguish, thousands of them camp after camp, "Shameful inhumanity proceeding in Malabar," says Mr. Gandhi. Shameful inhumanity indeed, wrought by the Moplas, and these are the victims, saved from extermination by British and Indian swords, For be it remembered the Moplas began the whole horrible business; the Government intervened to save their victims and these thousands have been saved. Mr. Gandhi would have hostilities suspended—so that the Moplas may sweep down on the refugee camps, and finish their work?
U||I visited in Calicut three huge Committee camps, two Christian, and the Congress building and compound where doles of rice are given daily from 7 A.M. to noon. In all, the arrangements were good. Big thatched sheds, and some buildings shelter the women and children, the men sleep outside. They are all managed by Indians, the Zamorini's Committee distributing cloths and money to all, except the Congress committee, which work independently and gives food from its own resource. At Palghat, similar arrangements are made by the Zamorini's Committee, and the order and care in feeding are good to see.
U||{135} Let me finish with a beautiful story told to me. Two Pulayas, the lowest of the submerged classes, were captured with others, and given the choice between Islam and Death. These, the outcaste of Hinduism, the untouchables, so loved the Hinduism which had been so unkind a step-mother to them, that they chose to die Hindus rather than to live Muslim. May the God of both, Muslim and Hindus send His messengers to these heroic souls, and give them rebirth into the Faith for which they died. New India, 29 November 1921.
U||Wilful murders of Hindus and arson were first begun in my own place by Chembrasseri Thangal and his Lieutenant, another Thangal. You might have read accounts written by me in the Malabar journal which was sent to you last time. This contagion began to spread like wild fire and we began to hear of murders daily. Within a fortnight cold-blooded murders of Hindus became very common. From within the borders of Calicut and Ernad taluks refugees come in large numbers with tales of murders and atrocities committed by the rebels. At Puthur Amson in Ernad only 12 miles northeast of Calicut—One day in broad daylight twenty-five persons who refused to embrace Islam were butchered and put into a well. One out of these who narrowly escaped death got out of the well when the rebels left the place and ran to Calicut for life. He is now in the hospital. So the accounts must be true as he himself was one of the victims.
U||During the last week news of numerous murders and forcible conversions came from another quarter also, Mannur near Aniyallur and Kadalundi railway station in Ernad taluk. This place also is only 14 miles away from Calicut. Every train to Calicut was carrying with it daily hundreds of refugees during the last week. If there were ten thousand refugees fed by the Relief Committee last week, it must have fed fifteen thousand this week. According to the statements given by them there must be at least fifty murders and numerous cases of conversions and house-burning. Can you conceive of a more ghastly and inhuman crime than the murders of babies and pregnant women? Two days {136} back I had occasion to read a report given by a refugee in Calicut. A pregnant woman carrying 7 months was cut through the abdomen by a rebel and she was seen lying dead on the way with the dead child projecting out of the womb. How horrible! Another: a baby of six months was snatched away from the breast of his own mother and cut into tw
U||o pieces. How heart-rending! Are these rebels human beings or monsters? From the same quarters numerous forcible conversions are also reported. One refugee has given statement that he had seen with his own eyes that the heads of a dozen people were being shaved by the rebels and afterwards they were asked to recite some passages from the Quran. This he witnessed from a tree. I wonder what is the authority of some people who contradict the news of murders, and forcible conversions of Hindus. Let them come here and test the veracity of these statements for themselves.
U||'Yesterday another report of murders came from a place very near Kottakal. The report says that eleven Hindus (males and females), were murdered by the rebels.
U||'A fortnight ago fifteen dead bodies of Hindus were seen under culvert on the road between Perinialmanna and Melatur.'
U||Will you not be sick of these stories of murders? All these reports are, as far as possible, proved also to be correct.
U||Words fail to express my feelings of indignation and abhorrence which I experienced when I came to know of an instance of rape, committed by the rebels under Chembrasseri Thangal. A respectable Nayar Lady at Melatur was stripped naked by the rebels in the presence of her husband and brothers, who were made to stand close by with their hands tied behind. When they shut their eyes in abhorrence they were compelled at the point of sword to open their eyes and witness the rape committed by the brute in their presence. I loathe even to write of such a mean action. I thank God that my family and relatives reached safe at Calicut without being dishonoured by these brutes, though we sustained serious loss of property and the loss of four lives (two servants and two relatives,—More afterwards). This instance of rape was communicated to me by one of her brothers confidentially. There are {137} several instances of such mean atrocities which are not revealed by people. New India 6th Dec. 1921.
U||Truth is infinitely of more paramount importance than Hindu-Muslim unity or Swaraj, and therefore, we tell the Maulana Sahib and his co-religionists and India's revered leader Mahatma Gandhi—if he too is unaware of the events here—that atrocities committed by the Moplahs on the Hindus are unfortunately too true and that there is nothing in the deeds of Moplah rebels which a true non-violent non-co-operator can congratulate them for. What is it for which they deserve congratulation? Their wanton and unprovoked attack on the Hindus, the all but wholesale looting at their houses in Ernad, and parts of Valluvanad, Ponnani, and Calicut Taliques; the forcible conversion of Hindus in a few places in the beginning of the rebellion and the wholesale conversion of those who stick to their homes in its later stages, the brutal murder of inoffensive Hindus, men, women, and children in cold blood, without the slightest reason except that they are "Kaffirs" or belong to the same race as the Policemen, who insulted the
U||ir Tangals or entered their Mosques, the desecration and burning of Hindu Temples the outrage on Hindu women and their forcible conversion and marriage by Moplahs; do these and similar atrocities proved beyond the shadow of a doubt by the statements recorded by us from the actual sufferers who have survived, deserve any congratulation? On the other hand should they not call forth the strongest condemnation from all right-minded men and more especially from a representative body of Mohamedans like the Khilafat Conference pledged to non-violence under all provocation? Did the Moplahs, who committed such atrocities, sacrifice their lives in the cause of their religion?

U||Maulana Mohani justifies the looting of Hindus by Moplahs as lawful by way of commandeering in a war between the latter and the Government or as a matter of necessity when the Moplahs were forced to live in jungles. Maulana perhaps does not know that in the majority of cases, the almost wholesale looting of Hindu houses in portions of Ernad, Valluvanad and Ponani Taluques was perpetrated on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of August before the military had arrived in the affected area to arrest or fight the rebels even before Martial law had been declared. The Moplahs had not betaken themselves to jungles at the time as Moulana supposes nor had the Hindus as a class done anything to them to deserve their hostility. The out-break commenced on the 20th of August, the police and the District Magistrate withdrew from Tirunangadi to Calicut on the 21st and the policemen throughout the affected area had taken to their heels. There was no adversary to the Moplahs at the time whom the Hindus could possibly have helped or in
U||vited, and the attack on them was most wanton and unprovoked.

U||APPENDIX V
U||Petition of Malabar Ladies to Lady Reading
U||To
U||Her Gracious Excellency
U||THE COUNTESS OF READING,
U||Delhi.
U||The humble memorial of the bereaved and sorrow-stricken women of Malabar.
U||May it please your gracious and compassionate Ladyship.
U||We, the Hindu women of Malabar of varying ranks and stations in life who have recently been overwhelmed by the tremendous catastrophe known as the Moplah rebellion, take the liberty to supplicate your Ladyship for sympathy and succour.
U||2. Your Ladyship is doubtless aware that though our unhappy district has witnessed many Moplah outbreaks in the course of the last one hundred years, the present rebellion is unexampled in its magnitude as well as unprecedented in its ferocity. But it is possible that your Ladyship is not fully appraised of all the horrors and atrocities perpetrated by the fiendish rebels; of the many wells and tanks filled up with the mutilated, but often only half dead bodies of our nearest and dearest ones who refused to abandon {140} the faith of our fathers; of pregnant women cut to pieces and left on the roadsides and in the jungles, with the unborn babe protruding from the mangled corpse; of our innocent and helpless children torn from our arms and done to death before our eyes and of our husbands and fathers tortured, flayed and burnt alive; of our hapless sisters forcibly carried away from the midst of kith and kin and subjected to every shame and outrage which the vile and brutal imagination of these inhuman hell-h
U||ounds could conceive of; of thousands of our homesteads reduced to cinder-mounds out of sheer savagery and a wanton spirit of destruction; of our places of worship desecrated and destroyed and of the images of the deity shamefully insulted by putting the entrails of slaughtered cows where flower garlands used to lie, or else smashed to pieces; of the wholesale looting of hard earned wealth of generations reducing many who were formerly rich and prosperous to publicly beg for a piece or two in the streets of Calicut, to buy salt or chilly or betel-leaf—rice being mercifully provided by the various relief agencies. These are not fables.
U||The wells full of rotting skeletons, the ruins which once were our dear homes, the heaps of stones which once were our places of worship—these are still here to attest to the truth. The cries of our murdered children in their death agonies are still ringing in our ears and will continue to haunt our memory till death brings us peace. We remember how driven out of our native hamlets we wandered starving and naked in the jungles and forests; we remember how we choked and stifled our babies' cries lest the sound should betray our hiding places to our relentless pursuers. We still vividly realise the moral and spiritual agony that thousand of us passed through when we were forcibly converted into the faith professed by these blood thirsty miscreants; we still have before us the sight of the unendurable and life long misery of those—fortunately few—of our most unhappy sisters who born and brought up in respectable families have been forcibly converted and then married to convict coolies. For five long month
U||s not a day has passed without its dread tale of horror to unfold.
U||3. Your gracious Ladyship's distracted memorialists have {141} endeavoured without exaggeration, without setting down aught in malice to convey at least some idea of the indescribably terrible agonies which they and thousands more of their sisters have been enduring for over five months now through this reign of inhuman frightfulness inaugurated and carried on in the name of the Khilafhat. We have briefly referred without going into their harrowing details to our heartrending tale of dishonour, outrage, rapine, and desolation. But if the past has been one of pain and anguish, the future is full of dread and gloom. We have to return to a ruined and desolated land. Our houses have been burnt or destroyed; may of our breadwinners killed; all our property looted; our cattle slaughtered. Repatriation without compensation means for us ruin, beggary, starvation. Will not the benign Government come to our aid and give us something to help us to begin life anew? We are now asked to settle down as paupers in the midst
U|| of the execrable fiends who robbed, insulted and murdered our loved ones—veritable demons such as hell itself could not let loose. Many of us shrink from the idea of going back to what there is left of our homes; for though the armed bands and rebels have been dispersed the rebellion cannot be said to be entirely quelled. It is like a venomous serpent whose spine has been partly broken, but whose poison fangs are still intact and whose striking power, if diminished, has not been destroyed. A few thousands of rebels have been killed and a few more thousands have been imprisoned, but as the Government are only too well aware many more thousands of rebels, looters, savagely militant evangelists and other inhuman monsters yet remain at large, a few in concealment, but most, moving about with arrogance openly threatening reprisals on all non-moslims who dare to return and resume possession of their property. Many refugees who went back have paid for their temerity with their lives. In fact, repatriation, if it
U|| is not to be a leap from the frying pan into the fire, must mean for the vast bulk of your Ladyship's impoverished and helpless memorialists and their families a hard inexorable problem of financial help, and adequate protection against renewed hellish outrages from which immunity would be utterly impossible as {142} long as thousands of men and even women and children of this semi-savage and fanatical race in whom the worst instinct of earth hunger, blood-lust and rapine have been awakened to fierce activity are free to prey upon their peaceable and inoffensive neighbours who—let it be most respectfully emphasised—because of their implicit trust in the power and the will of a just and benign Government to protect them, had suffered their own art and capacity for selfdefence to emasculate and decay.
U||4. We, Your Ladyship's humble and sorrow-stricken memorialists do not seek vengeance. Our misery will not be rendered less by inflicting similar misery upon this barbarous and savage race; our dead will not return to us if their slayers are slaughtered. We would not be human, however, if we could ever forget the cruel and shameful outrages and indignities perpetrated upon us by a race to whom we have always endeavoured to be friendly and neighbourly; we would be hypocritical if, robbed of all our possessions we did not plead for some measure of compensation to help us out of the pauperism now forced upon us; we would be imbecile, if knowing the ungovernable, anti-social propensities and the deadly religious fanaticism of the moplah race we did not entreat the just and powerful government to protect the lives and honour of your humble sisters who have to live in the rebel-ravaged zone. Our ambition after all is low enough; sufficient compensation to save us and our children from starvation, and enough militar
U||y protection against massacre and outrage are all that we want. We beseech Your Compassionate Ladyship to exercise all the benevolent influence that you possess with the government to see that our humble prayers are granted. But if the benign Government does not consider it possible to compensate us and to protect us in our native land we would most fervently pray that free grants of land may be assigned to us in some neighbouring region which though less blessed with the lavish gifts of nature may also be less cursed by the cruelty and brutality of man.
U||We beg to remain,
U||Your Ladyship's most humble
U||and obedient servants,

U||APPENDIX VI
U||ON NON-CO-OPERATION
U||By M. R. Jayakar
U||[We take the following extracts from the Presidential address of Mr. M. R. Jayakar at the Third Thana District Conference. Mr. Jayakar is a well-known Non-Co-operator who believes in the "principles and policy" of the movement and who joined the movement because he realised that "Our quarrel with the bureaucracy was far more substantial than our differences with the Congress Programme."]
U||The Failure of the Programme
U||The principles and the policy of the movement (N.C.O.) are substantially sound and have achieved unexpected success. But, with every month that has passed, the need has been felt in many quarters of revising and adjusting the programme in the light of previous experience. When dispassionately judged by such experience it will be found that some details of the congress programme have not achieved the desired success; on the contrary, they have formed weak links in the main. When these items were undertaken they evoked a large volume of adverse criticism in the ranks of Congress workers. Many of them have, no doubt, subordinated their differences, out of loyalty to the main cause, and quite a large number, out of their esteem and regard for the personality of the selfless and saintly promoter of the movement. But, notwithstanding this admirable display of loyalty among Congress men, the fact remains and has to be reckoned with, that many items have proved unsuccessful and perhaps act, in consequence as a clog 
U||on the movement. The soreness, which some of these details have caused, still remains and is operating to undivide some from others and makes them lukewarm or unwilling to throw their whole heart into this movement. If these co-workers of ours could be placated by a revision of the Congress programme, so that most of the earnest-minded workers for cause could substantially agree to its {144} adoption, it would be a great advantage. And herein perhaps, lay the chief merit of the amendment moved by Mr. B. C. Pal, which was rejected by the majority at Calcutta. Taken at its highest, our success has not gone much beyond what that amendment would have made possible. It would have had the further advantage of retaining within our ranks many of our former associates, who are, at present, either lukewarm or hostile.
U||Experiment in youthful sacrifice
U||When once the necessity is recognized of revising the programme in the light of these comments, which are being made throughout the country, it will not be difficult to find out in what directions the programme has not achieved the expected success and the reasons for the same. For instance, the boycott of schools and colleges have not succeeded and even persons, of known and undoubted loyalty to the cause, complain that the action of Congress workers has caused more harm than good. They concentrated too much on the disruption of existing institutions and less on the creation and maintenance of new ones on "national" lines. They forgot that a student cannot be left idle in the street and that, if the Congress must call him out, it can only be after it has provided for him a good substitute. In Bombay we let pass the psychological moment when we could have founded and reared up an excellent college with various branches. Public enthusiasm was ripe for it in the early part of the year, but we let it evaporate 
U||in declamation and emotional exaltation. Some went so far as to suggest that it was no part of the Congress programme to start national Colleges though the terms of the Congress Resolution specially provided for it. 50000 boys are out in idleness, says Sir Ashutosh Mukherji, some may glorify in this catastrophe, but there are many who regard this disruptive event with sad dismay. We have experimented too much in youthful sacrifice. Our youth have reciprocated with more love and tenderness than we have shown for their welfare. The few good institutions which Congress workers have created, are suffering from our neglect and apathy and dragging a weary existence. The shadow of a name has, very often been pursued, to the abandonment of the substance, and we now {145} find a large number of boys in the country, who are practically loafing in the streets, with a vague ambition "to do something patriotic".
U||The Lawyer-Failure
U||Our ban on lawyers has, likewise, not attained much success. Few lawyers, whose sacrifice of their practice has added strength to the Congress cause, have responded to the call. The prestige of British court in civil Suits between an Indian and Indian has not been destroyed and can not be so easily destroyed; for, ordinarily this variety of legal contests is not much colored with injustice, as political trials are. If lawyers had been called out, because, being a trained class of workers, the country wanted their undivided time and attention at this critical hour, it would have been a different matter, and, perhaps, if the call had been so made many, many more would have responded to it. But it was put the wrong way, and the lawyer was made to appear as if, in pursuing his profession, he was acting sinfully and must atone for it by a complete withdrawal from practice. The result was that, out of sheer self-respect, many really good lawyers have declined to respond to the call. Many could not give up their pr
U||actice for pecuniary reasons and were too honest to adopt subterfuges calculated to create a semblance of sacrifice. Lawyers have become "pariahs" of our present political life. Some of them had borne the brunt of public agitation for more than two decades; their place is vacant and no class of workers of equal intelligence and keenness has come forward to take it.
U||A Foul Atmosphere
U||This part of the Congress programme has created a foul atmosphere of hypocrisy, intolerance, imposture and conceit in the Congress Camp, in which modesty, self-respect, and honesty often time find it hard to hold their place. In our enthusiasm, we forget that many lawyers value their profession for the training it affords in courage, truthfulness, honor and toleration. No other profession trains a young man so well to withstand and expose injustice and to uphold the tradition of truth and honor. Our past political history of thirty-three years is a brilliant record of the services rendered {146} by lawyers to the Congress cause. If a greater sacrifice than before was needed now on their part, a direct call on their self-respect and patriotism on this footing should have been made, but no good has arisen from putting the lawyer under the ban of ridicule and infamy. The call made upon them was singularly harsh. No other class of public workers was required to give up his means of livelihood. The importing merc
U||hant supports British prestige as much as, if not more than the lawyer and yet he stalks unabashed in the Congress camp without closing his shop. No ban was put on litigants, without whom the lawyer cannot thrive. I am therefore, surprised that notwithstanding so much hardship, so many lawyers have come out and are to be found in the vanguard of the movement. The few courts of justice, we called into existence have not had enough support and are a mockery.
U||Revise the Programme
U||The failure of these parts of the programme is now practically admitted and they are now pushed into the background. It would be better if, in revising the programme in the next Session of the Congress, these limbs, which have ceased to function or respond to the laws of our growth, are boldly amputated. In any event, they make clear the necessity of a revision, so as to render the programme more effective, elastic and practical.
U||Enter the Councils
U||The fight requires to be carried on in manifold ways. Some may carry it in the Councils, face to face with the officials. Why cannot "Non-Co-operation," in its proper sense, be practised in the Councils? Sir P. M. Mehta, when he left the Council Hall with his colleagues on a memorable occasion when he, face to face with the then home member, mercilessly uncloacked the preposterous pretensions of the bureaucracy, was fighting with weapons and a spirit which many Non-Co-operators of the true and accredited brand may envy in these days. If Non-Co-operation is an attitude of the mind, as its eminent author conceives it, and not so much a programme or a creed, a Council Hall is as fitting a place for its display as a mass meeting in a Marwadi Vidyalaya. The {147} spirit resides in the mind and is independent of the environment. It is no ground to say that, often times, the environment frightens a weakling, for we do not build our doctrines only on the possibility of men being weak and timid.
U||N.C.O. Concession
U||We have already departed from the original rigor of our programme in this behalf. A Non-Co-operator can now compete at Municipal elections. He can offer advice to Government in or outside private interviews. Non-co-operator papers do report the proceedings of the Legislative Bodies, comment on them, and suggest remedies for the benefit of the Government. Scarcely a non-Co-operator now-a-days speaks without referring to gubernatorial utterances and orders in Council. He comments on the policies of Government, suggesting remedies as he goes on with his comments. Several lawyers in Bombay, who are still in practice, are now allowed to occupy prominent places as speakers at Non-Co-operation meetings. This is as it should be, for we cannot afford to ignore or despise, in the stinted state as our resources, the co-operation of any honest workers, prepared to make a sacrifice commensurate with his capacity. This is all done now silently and as a concession. My plea is for making the programme so wide, elastic and n
U||atural, as to turn these concessions into acknowledged rights. The Congress Creed calls upon us to obtain Swaraj by all legitimate and peaceful means. All weapons, all avenues of work and all manner of public workers are enjoined on us, for the attainment of the common end. Why set up ascetic standards, unpractical tests, and unnatural bans, which may often let in the dishonest but keep out the honest man, whose co-operation, even with a difference, is often worth loving. The programme may become theoretically less perfect, perhaps logically less consistent, but it will certainly be more natural, real and effective.
U||Suggested Modifications
U||The exact form of the modification must be left to future discussion. I would, therefore, suggest as follows:
U||(1) That foreign propaganda, so summarily put an end to at {148} the last Congress, be resumed and if possible extended within proper bounds. The Indian view has to be put forward before the civilised world. This is an urgent need of the hour. The Government are doing it from their own point of view, and we ought to do the same from ours.
U||(2) That the time limited be abandoned, for reasons mentioned in para 25 below.
U||(3) That the elections to Legislative Bodies, whenever a chance should occur, should be contested perhaps with the limitation, that in the Provinces, unless complete autonomy is introduced, Congressmen should not accept office under the present system of Government. This may be, if so desired, made conditional on Government agreeing to dissolve the present Bodies.
U||(4) A large modification of the educational boycott, including the total abrogation of the compulsory part of it. Attention should be concentrated more on the creation of national institutions than on the withdrawal of students as a set propaganda. When such institutions are projected, and some of them actually in existence, and they compete favorably with state aided institutions, I have no doubt that sufficient impulses have been generated in the country to secure the exercise of the option in favor of the former. Side by side with this, an intensive propaganda should be carried on in the Councils and outside, having for its object the popularisation of the Universities by a change of the Act governing them, and also the "nationalisation" of the existing system of state-aided education, so as to bring it into greater accord with the present-day requirements and aspirations of the people. To me, it seems to be such a pity that we have deserted this avenue of agitation, to be feebly utilised by a few persons
U|| in the present Councils, struggling against an unsuitable environment. Nine crores, which is nearly the total output on State education, we are not in a position to despise, and it seems wrong to wait for this reform till complete Swarajya is attained, which may or may not be for some time yet. Considerable harm has been done to the cause of education by the exclusion of this avenue work from the programme of Congress activities. The fate of primary {149} education in the Bombay presidency will clearly illustrate the point I am making.
U||(5) A large modification of the ban against lawyers, so as to admit of several grades of sacrifice from complete abstention from practice to a giving up of the entirety or a part of the earnings. A way should be found for getting as many lawyers as possible to work in this movement provided they are prepared to give the cause at least a part of their time or money. The Congress ought to modify its call, so as to make it possible for all honest-minded lawyers to bear the burden of the country's cause, commensurate with their capacity to sacrifice.
U||Similarly, in the matter of conducting defences in British courts, some curious departure have come to be made from the strict Congress rule. These departures only indicate that, in its operation, the rule has been found unpractical and irksome. Congressmen are not to engage pleaders nor offer a defence with legal aid. They are simply to make a "statement." A statement is as much an aid to the administration of justice as a lawyer-made defence, and in so far, it equally supports the prestige of British courts. Only, it has the disadvantage of being prolix and unconvincing. It, therefore, fails of its mark more often than a lawyer's defence.
U||Who can urge that the long and interesting statements made by the Ali Brothers and their co-accused, in the trial at Karachi were out of place? Yet they had all the features of a lawyer-made defence, as an aid to the court. The evidence was discussed, legal objections raised, relevancy commented on and the prosecution evidence answered. All this assistance was given to the court, helping it to arrive at truth and justice, precisely in the same way as a practising lawyer aids judicial administration.
U||If a statement is permitted, why cannot a lawyer be employed in Court to make it more convincing and exculpatory? A statement must be based on facts, and these facts become material only when proved. On what rational grounds can, therefore, a statement permitted and yet the material evidence supporting it disallowed? It is no answer to say that the statement {150} is meant for the guidance of the Swaraj Courts when the same are established, for when that eventuality happens, a statement supported by evidence will be any a better help to these Swaraj Courts than a mere statement? It is obvious that no Swaraj Court will liberate a man merely on his own statement, without further inquiry.
U||Civil Disobedience
U||We are on the eve of Mahatma Gandhi undertaking an important part of his programme by starting Civil Disobedience in a district in Surat. It is very difficult to offer any useful comment on this undertaking because beyond the general lines, his programme in its detail is not yet before the Country. We can only hope that the resistance to law will not be so undertaken as to be widely interpreted as a sort of charter for general lawlessness. That would be a catastrophe for which the country is not prepared. This seems also to be Mr. Gandhi's opinion, for he has very prudently circumscribed the practice of the resistance with very severe restrictions, involving a moral and economic preparation. To disobey specific orders of Government or their officials, which have no moral sanction behind them or are illegal in their inception, is a comparatively easy matter, fraught with no far-reaching harm to the community. The disobedience, in such a case commands the moral approval of the civilised community, and ends onl
U||y by affecting the prestige of the promulgator of the order. But when a campaign is undertaken involving a wholesale and general defiance of order and authority, forces may arise, which, in the hands of inexperienced and enthusiastic associates or partisans, may reach extreme limits, involving the community in chaos, disorder and possibly violence. The country has had only a year's training in his (Mr. Gandhi) counsels of non-violent resistance—far too short a period for his countrymen to imbibe his spirit, in a manner worthy of his teaching. May we, therefore, hope that in launching on this undertaking he will seriously consider this aspect of the case? We shall of course, watch his experiment but with concern and solicitude, feeling secure in the {151} hope, created by his magnificent personality, that in his hands the destinies of the country are perfectly safe.
U||APPENDIX VII
U||Extracts from the speech delivered by His Excellency Sir Harcourt Butler,
U||Governor of the U. P. of Agra & Oudh,
U||at the opening of the U. P. Legislative Council,
U||Lucknow, 22nd January, 1921
U||Mr. President and Members of the Legislative Council,
U||"Great efforts have been made to draw away young men from schools and colleges and to induce professional men to give up their careers. Great efforts have been made to prevent voters from going to the polls. But these efforts have met with little success. The elections have undoubtedly given the province a really representative legislative council. The chief opponents of the reforms have shown by word and act that their aim is not the ordered development of political institutions in India but the expulsions of Western civilization from India—a course involving the reversion to the condition of disorder, lawlessness and internecine strife such as prevailed in the unsettled times before the advent of British rule."
U||"The tenantry were widely stirred up. The criminal classes took advantage of the occasion and serious trouble ensued in which there was regrettable loss of life. A full report on the Rae Bareli disturbances will be published within a few days. It was fortunately possible to restore order without calling in military aid from outside, and for this I have already congratulated the local authorities and others concerned. Statements, I may say that all reports from both Rae Bareli and Fyzabad indicate that the tenantry are actuated by no hostility to Government or to Europeans. The agitators have endeavoured to stir up such hostility."
U||"As for my Government I have chosen as colleagues without {152} favour strong and independent men. They will have my complete confidence in all matters, and it is my desire that we should work together as far as possible as one Government. I shall endeavour to secure that we all, Europeans and Indians, work together on harmonious lines as brother-subjects of the King-Emperor; and I pray that the Reforms Scheme which we are commencing to-day will and largely and effectively to the well-being and happiness of this ancient land of Hindustan."
U||APPENDIX VIII
U||Extracts from the speech delivered by His Excellency Sir Harcourt Butler
U||at a meeting of the United Provinces Legislative Council
U||28th March 1921
U||Mr. President and Members of the Legislative Council,
U||"The recent disorder in Rae Bareli has necessitated a further reconsideration of the question. Whereas the former disorders in Rae Bareli were largely agrarian in origin the recent disorders were mainly political in origin and wholly revolutionary".
U||"The result of the disorders has been an unfortunate loss of life, for which the agitators are directly responsible, and a feeling of insecurity which if unchecked may spread with untoward results, affecting innocent and guilty alike. Confronted with an elemental question as to the maintenance of order, my Government came unanimously to the conclusion that it was necessary to stop the campaign of unconstitutional agitation and lying, propaganda which has been carried on the four south-eastern districts of Outh—Rae Bareli, Partabgarh, Sultanpur and Fyzabad. We therefore applied to the Government of India to extend the Seditious Meetings Act to those four districts. This has been done".
U||"I believe that this action will have the support of this Council and of responsible people generally in this province. With the non-co-operators we can have nothing to do beyond meeting their {153} mischievous activities. Their movement is a revolutionary movement playing on passion and pandering to ignorance but the mass of people are loyal and all their interests are bound up with the maintenance of order."
U||APPENDIX IX
U||Extracts from the speech by His Excellency Sir Harcourt Butler
U||at a Durbar held at Lucknow
U||17th December 1921
U||Gentlemen,
U||I am glad to have this opportunity of meeting you to-day, in formal assembly, and to outline to you the policy of the Government.
U||My Government was accused some months ago of being repressive. I have met that charge completely with facts and figures and proved that the Government has acted with due patience in spite of deliberate and repeated provocation. It has dealt with agitation under the ordinary law and has maintained order and security with reasonable success. Of late the agitators, whose openly avowed object is to make Government impossible, have entered on a campaign of increased activity. Quite recently the Government received reports from several quarters foreshadowing lawlessness and disorder. The Collector of Meerut reported that civil disobedience had been openly preached at the District Congress at Garhmukhtesar, that cloth shops were picketed, that agitation was plainly on the increase, and that everything looked like working up to a climax at an early date. The Commissioner of Fyzabad reported that the situation was menacing in the Bara Banki district where the Deputy Commissioner could not appear without being hooted 
U||and the loyal section of population were frightened and disheartened. A speech was delivered in which the audience was asked by a political fanatic whether they would agree to murder the Deputy Commissioner and they replied with one voice that they would. The Commissioner also reported that {154} things were menacing in the Tanda sub-division of the Fyzabad district. At Gonda regular volunteer corps had been instituted with officers. From Cawnpore and Etawah reports came of a recrudescence of criminal intimidation. In Ballia the people were asked to prepare themselves for killing and being killed. Alarming reports were also received from Saharanpur, Aligarh and Gorakhpur.
U||Now all these reports reached the Government within three or four days. It was quite clear that we were on the verge of serious and widespread trouble. The Government decided, and decided unanimously, to apply the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 1908, part II, to the whole province at once and to issue instructions to Commissioners and District Officers to take all measures under the law necessary for the preservation of order and protection of loyal and peaceful citizens. This was followed by an open defiance to the Government signed by over seventy individuals in the Independent newspaper. As you are aware the ringleaders have been arrested. I do not propose to deal with individual cases; some of them are still under trial. I will only say this, that all the reports I have received from different parts of the province show that the action taken has had excellent result and has restored confidence to loyal and peaceful people. Indeed, there is a feeling of general relief. The Commissioner of Fyazabad report
U||s "There has been a great improvement since I last wrote. The police who had resigned are now applying to be taken back." The Commissioner of Agra writes "The present Government policy appears to be generally welcomed." The Commissioner of Gorakhpur says "There is no doubt that the moderate party not only welcome the arrests but in some cases are jubilant over them." The Commissioner of Meerut reports that the action taken had "been hailed by all loyal persons with the greatest relief." He adds "our friends and the much harried police are in much better hearts and non-co-operator is no longer looked upon with dread by them." The Commissioner of Lucknow attributes the settling down of the Hindu population and especially the cultivating classes largely to the recent action of Government. A re-assuring report has come from Aligarh. The situation is still critical; but, I think, that it is well {155} in hand, and I am convinced that if a policy of firmness is pursued and pursued steadily for some time we may rea
U||sonably hope to break the back of a conspiracy which openly avows its intention of trying to do away with Government and openly defies the law of the land.
U||Consider the position, gentlemen; What have the Congress and Khilafat movements done? Satyagraha, which Mr. Gandhi himself pronounced to be a "Himalayan blunder" ended in disgrace. The attempt to boycott colleges and schools failed signally. It did not affect in this province one per cent of the students and scholars. The attempt to boycott the law courts was wholly unsuccessful. The appeal to surrender titles given by and offices held under the Government fell on deaf ears. The efforts to seduce soldiers and policemen were almost in vain. But with each successive failure, they have sown wider the seeds of racial hatred and the spirit of lawlessness. The results cry out against them and their work. Their hands are dripping with innocent blood; and the cries of ruined homes and ravished women have gone up to heaven. This is the end of the idea of self-Government attained by non-violent revolution, an idea wholly fantastic and chimerical.
U||As is usual when Government takes vigorous action, there is a body of critics who have no experience or sense of government and who are frightened by action. They seem to think that law and order keep themselves. The truth is far otherwise. Law and order are mainly kept by force, and that with difficulty. They are very easily upset. You have had experience of disorder in southern Oudh, in which there was an orgy of violence, rape, rapine and arson. I do not hesitate to tell you that if the Government trifled with the present situation you would probably soon find your lives, your property and your honour in danger. The objection that action has been taken with warning is quite unfounded. More than once I have publicly declared that this Government would not tolerate disorder or intimidation. The aggressors are those who violate the law.
U||{156}
U||APPENDIX X
U||STATEMENT BY SIR L. PORTER
U||We have been vilified bitterly, every kind of abuse has been showered on us by non-co-operators, every form of insidious agitation has been tried, and we have stayed our hands.
U||Violent Agitators
U||I will mention the case of one of the men who has now been arrested and is undergoing imprisonment as a first-class misdemeanant. He made at least ten speeches up and down the country which our legal advisers informed us were clearly actionable. I allude to Mr. Jawahir Lal Nebru. His final effort was a speech, somewhere in the west of the Province, in which he quoted word by word the sedition section, i.e., the promotion, of disaffection against the Government as by law established and the section which deals with promoting hatred between classes of His Majesty's subjects, and he said that the object of his life was to carry out this promotion of sedition and disaffection. Still we did nothing. You may well ask why. We thought that the forces of reason and sobriety would re-establish their sway. We hoped that the great body of moderate opinion of the Provinces would be sufficiently powerful to assuage this movement and to stop the dissemination of poison. We were wrong. So far from losing any strength I do n
U||ot hesitate to say that the movement has gone on gaining strength. Then came the time in November when we were confronted with reports from our trusted officers all over the provinces which left no doubt whatever in our minds that the situation had very greatly developed, and that there was imminent possibility (I would go further and say probability) of an outburst of violence in more than one district. I have here a big folio of reports. It is quite impossible for me in debate like this to quote them all. There are copies of reports from districts as wide apart and representative as Meerut, Cawnpur, Fyzabad, Etawah, Balia, Barabanki and the peaceful district of Aligarh, which, according to its member, Thakur Manak Singh, is now the scene of this campaign of repression. {157} I should like, as a typical instance, to read out the description of the procedure which was adopted in the Barabanki district. The Barabanki district, as my friend on my right will bear me out, is a particularly difficult one. It is f
U||ull of a class whom religious fanaticism particularly affects and when it once gets out of hand it is very difficult to deal with. I remember when I first came to India, there was tremendous outbreak of dacoity and violent crime in that and adjacent districts, which it took months to put down, at the cost of immense suffering to the population. This is one of the districts, which was selected as a focus in work on by these (what should I call them?) advocates of soul force.
U||Soul Force
U||Their main activities were directed to stirring up religious fanaticism. In mosques, in bazars mendacious stories were told regarding the bombardment and desecration of the Sacred Places of Islam. They were told that Hindu and Mahomedan women had been outraged and that medicines issued from dispensaries were mixed with wine and that the fat of cows and pigs was used in the manufacture of cloth. There was boycott and intimidation to prevent foreign cloth sellers from importing any more cloth, and to force them to sign a pledge not to do so. This went on until November and the beginning of December when the picketing of schools started. That is a typical report from a district which takes very little to set it ablaze. What has recently happened there you have already read in the papers. There are many other instances which strike me, but there is one typical instance from Etawah. There is a fair which has been held there for many years. It was picketed. People were prevented from coming in by open intimidation
U|| and finally attempts were made to blacken the face of a Maulvi on his way to the Islamia High School, of which he is manager. I can multiply these instances, and, if any member of the Council wishes to know the representations which were received from these districts, I am perfectly willing to let him see the reports in order that he may satisfy himself as to what the real condition was.
U||{158} Pandit Radha Kant Malviya: Will the Hon. Member read the report from Allahabad.
U||Sir Ludovic Porter: We had a report from the Commissioner of Allahabad, on whose judgment I place great reliance, just before we enforced this Act. He expressed his reasoned opinion that if we allowed matters to drift any further, there would be a widespread disaster. He also stated that from information he had received, the whole camp of non-co-operators, in Allahabad were particularly cheerful with regard to the outlook, and they thought great developments in their favour were shortly going to take place. Well that was our position. As to the nature of this non-violent non-co-operation, we had no delusions.
U||Criminal Intimidation
U||We know that criminal intimidation had been practised on the widest scale in many districts. I may say that the majority of districts where these associations existed, criminal intimidation of a subtle kind, namely to attack a man in his religious opinions or to attack him in his social relations, had been widely practised. We had an example here in Lucknow of ordinary intimidation. A member of the Council himself witnessed the unfortunate driver of an ekka being dragged off his ekka and beaten because he ventured to ply for hire on the 17th of November.
U||I know myself the case of a shop which was kept open for two or three days. The shopkeeper was surrounded by a howling mob, and he was told what would happen to him, if he did not shut up his shop. In Fatehpur they kept a blackboard, which was exhibited publicly, to show up the people, who ventured to buy foreign cloth. This is also a form of subtle and most cruel intimidation involving social boycott. You all know perfectly well the difficulties that exist in India in getting victims of this kind of tyranny to come forward and seek their legal redress in the ordinary courts of law. The difficulty of proving criminal intimidation is accentuated by the fact that it is not cognizable by the police, and, consequently the complainant has to go to court, but, owing to the difficulty of getting witnesses to prove his case, he usually {159} compromises. Well that is the position which confronted us. There was a system of widespread intimidation. So far from the movement being on the verge of collapse, as certain op
U||timists stated to-day, it was increasing in vigour. There was the usual lip service of non-violence, a profession which in me produces a feeling of nausea. Practice and precept, as we said in a letter to the Government of India, which they quoted in the debate "were poles as under." There were also, as my friend Kunwar Jagdish Parshad in his eloquent speech this morning has stated, constant endeavours to seduce Government servants from their duty. A great deal of pity has been showered on the non-co-operators by certain speakers to-day, but they never spared a moment to think what the police have gone through. Here in Lucknow Chauk, sub-inspectors and the rank and file of your own fellow countrymen have been grossly insulted, abused and their family life rendered intolerable. Are we not going to support them when such facts are brought to our notice? We are bound to support our loyal servants, who, through all these troubles, have served us faithfully. I am only asking for some recognition of the difficulty 
U||to which they are exposed in performing their duties, and in their daily life. With these facts before us we came to the conclusion—the Government as a whole came to the conclusion—that the Criminal Law Amendment should be extended to these Provinces. I think there can be no doubt that the whole Council are unanimous that law and order must be enforced. They may differ from us as to the method which we took.
U||The Arrests
U||I now come to the arrests which followed. The great majority of arrests were effected by the local authorities under the powers delegated to them. In one instance only so far as my memory serves, the Governor-in-Council issued orders for certain arrests, and that was for the leaders of Allahabad and Lucknow. What are the facts in regard to these particular arrests? These associations had been declared to be illegal. Immediately after their proclamation a manifesto was published on the 6th December with a pledge which was signed by 75 persons, {160} I will read the terms of that manifesto. "Having read and thoroughly understood the Government notification, etc., and knowing full well the consequences of not obeying them, we, etc., hereby pledge ourselves civilly to disobey without any objection all such Government orders and laws as may be determined from time to time by the Provincial Congress Committee, or by a committee appointed by or in this behalf. We further pledge ourselves to obey, in utter disregard
U|| of the consequences, all orders of the volunteer corps relating to such disobedience." Now gentlemen, what does that mean? It means that at the bidding of an irresponsible autocrat in Bombay, the members of this association pledged themselves blindly to disobey any law of the land. If that is not the essence of anarchy I do not know what is. We were told this morning in the very moderate speech of my friend Mr. Zafar Husain, that he did not think that this Act was enacted with a view to the present juncture. Of course it was not. Nobody could forsee this madness which has come over India during the last two years. It was enacted to meet an outbreak of anarchy in Bengal. Could there be anything worse than the present position, that a body of men numbering thousands, totally irresponsible, very many of them now of a dangerous character, (not at first, but they are steadily deteriorating) pledge themselves to disobey any law when they were asked to do so by a gentlemen in Bombay, for this is what this pledge m
U||eans? How could any Government carry on, that would not accept that challenge? In consequence of this, we issued orders for the arrest and production of a certain number, not all, of the leaders. In doing so we have now the support and authority of the Government of India. The Government has informed us that they agree with us in holding that the persons who deliberately organise associations, avowedly intended to break the law, or associations the members of which are pledged blindly to disobey any laws, are liable to criminal prosecution. Following on that came the meeting at Allahabad, at which the Superintendent of Police, who had been deputed to execute a search warrant, was present. This meeting deliberately reaffirmed this pledge in his presence. Now, I think if we analyse the objections that have {161} been taken to the prosecutions they very largely centre round those persons, the leaders and members of this meeting, who have been prosecuted and convicted. In all they number, I, think, something lik
U||e 100. I have stated the facts, and I accept the responsibility. I see no other way out. As long as any Government exists they have to deal with men who offer a challenge like that, in the method in which we did.
U||APPENDIX XI
U||BARABANKI DISORDERS
U||Lucknow, 18th January
U||In a view of the various rumours that were current regarding the situation at Barabanki....
U||A lengthy official communique has just now been issued based on the report of the Deputy Commissioner....
U||At the same time, with effect from the 23rd November 1921 the Criminal Law Amendment Act was applied to the Province. Its immediate effect was good, and several volunteers who had been parading in uniform doffed their sashes and were disbanded.
U||Khilafat Agitators
U||Unfortunately, however, Khilafat agitators, who had publicly announced in the press of the 18th November that Barabanki Tahsil was being prepared for civil disobedience by the end of November, considered this act a suitable one to infringe. They redoubled their efforts and collected considerable sums, mainly for the Angora Fund, both through members of the 46 Khilafat committees established in this district and by itinery volunteers, who were paid for their services, either by fixed monthly salaries or by a percentage on collections. Between the 19th and 24th December, four volunteers were arrested under Section 7 (1) and 17 (2) of the Act, and these arrests were reported to have had a temporary beneficial effect. By the 3rd January, when the District delegates {162} returned from the Ahmedabad conference, the leaders decided to take action openly. On the 4th it was reported to me that large numbers of volunteers would march into the city under the command of their zemindar leaders. No precise information ho
U||wever, could be obtained as to their intentions. On the morning of the 7th January batches of volunteers began to issue chiefly from the Congress Office from which was hung a Khilafat flag and a large notice calling on people to enlist as volunteers. These volunteers were mostly from outside villages and were headed by petty zemindars. They were all Mahomedans and had been worked up to a high pitch of religious enthusiasm. Many of them had their Qurans slung round their necks. They had apparently been incited to a state bordering on religious frenzy by exhortations from their leaders, that their religion was being destroyed by the British Government. They were wild in their abuse of Government, officials and specially the Police. The whole religious street in front of the Congress office resounded with religious shouts and cries of "Victory to Islam". The cry of "Allah ho Akbar" was uttered as a war cry with fanatical zeal, specially when any arrests were made.
U||The Arrests
U||I had deputed Mr. Colton, Superintendent of Police, and Babu Ambikanandan Singh, Sub-Divisional Officer to take up a position opposite the Congress office and to arrest the ring leaders and the most truculent of the volunteers as it did not appear to be safe to allow them to remain at large, specially as fresh volunteers continued to pour into the city. Those selected were marched down under an escort to the Jail....
U||The procession was accompanied by noisy music and the usual shouts of non-co-operation were raised. He (Chaudhari Athar Ali) refused to go before the Deputy Magistrate as requested but mounting the steps of the Congress office delivered a speech. After reciting certain words from the Qoran he addressed the crowd, and in a loud voice, declared that this tyrannical Government or tyrannical race (both versions are given) should be destroyed. The {163} crowd, which was in a state of fanatical frenzy, replied, "Amin, it will be destroyed immediately". He exhorted the crowd to "become volunteers, enrol volunteers and fill the jails—victory to Islam". The cry was taken up by the crowd. Seeing that the speech was causing great excitement, the Deputy Magistrate directed the police to produce him before him. He refused to go to the jail in the Ekka provided by the Deputy Magistrate, but insisted on going on foot, taking a circuitous route at the head of the procession of 500 or 1,000 men. He stopped the procession a
U||t various places and at these halts the usual jais were raised. The police were abused and Government servants were called dogs and pigs. On this day ten volunteers were arrested. On this date also there was the same commotion in the city, but the number of volunteers decreased.
U||Throughout the four days the volunteers created disturbances. It was obvious that the movement was entirely a Mahomedan one. Not a single Hindu volunteer appeared. The Mahomedan volunteers and the crowd which cheered them on were filled with religious enthusiasm and hatred of the British Government. The intention of their leaders apparently, was to provoke the Police to acts of violence against them, and also to prove that they could insult the Government official with impunity, and were not afraid to go to jail. The following remark made in jail by Nawab Ali, an ex-vakil, a few minutes after his sentence, in the presence of two magistrates and a large number of pleaders, is significant. "By imprisonment people would get accustomed to the horrors of jail. By shooting they would learn to bare their breasts to rifle shots and bayonets. Men ready to be shot should now be enlisted." The accused have been convicted.—The Pioneer January 20, 1922.

U||THE GORAKHPUR TRAGEDY
U||Gorakhpur, 7th February
U||From early morning on Saturday a large number of volunteers were noticed arriving at Chauri Chaura and collecting on the Gorakhpur side of the railway station. They then proceeded towards the Bhapa Bazar, and formed a procession. They said that they were going to picket the bazar, and they proceeded towards the bazar through the police station grounds, although this was not their direct route. The procession consisted roughly of 3,000 people, and was headed by four or five volunteers in khaddar uniform. Some of them had swaraj flags in their hands. After the main body of the procession had gone on, there were a few stragglers with whom the police, it is alleged, had some interchange of remarks. It is also stated that one or two of the stragglers were hustled by some of the chowkidars.
U||The Mob breaks Loose
U||It is impossible to say exactly what happened next but at any rate the stragglers shouted out and main procession came back and started throwing kanker at the Police. For some time the attack was confined to vicious kanker throwing, in which thousands of volunteers were engaged. The sub-inspector, finding that the affair was taking a more serious turn, asked the rioters to desist, but they would not take any heed, and attacked the police with lathies. The sub-inspector, in order to frighten the mob, fired a few shots in the air. This infuriated the mob, who made a rush towards the thana with lathies and spears. A few policemen were knocked down, and the remainder of the police went inside the thana buildings for protection. One or two policemen must have fired on the mob in earnest, as some of the rioters had received gunshot wounds, but whether the firing took place before the rush or after it is not known yet. By this time several of the policemen had been killed outside the police buildings, and one party
U|| fetched {165} oil and straw and set fire to the thana at various points. This drove the entire police force out of the buildings.
U||They were immediately set upon by the mob and done to death in the most brutal manner. Their heads were battered with hinges torn from the doors of the thana, and then the bodies were soaked in oil and burnt. The charred remains were recovered, some in front of the thana, others in the thana compound and one at the back of the thana. Some of the armed policemen had obviously been battered to death by their own muskets. There was a certain amount of money in the thana and it is suspected that the rioters, having killed the policemen, looted the thana and then set fire to the buildings. The sub-Inspector's family quarters, it is believed, were also looted, and cash and jewellery were removed, but the inmates were not interfered with. The family quarters also bear marks of violence. The windows have been removed, and there are wide apertures in the roof. After having completely destroyed the police station the rioters dismantled the railway line in two places, and cut the telegraph wires. They threatened to kil
U||l the railway station master and the post master of Chauri Chaura if they sent any messages to the authorities at Gorakhpur. In all 22 policemen, including two Sub Inspectors, one head constable, 15 constables, four chowkidars and a servant of the Sub-Inspector were killed. Among the dead were found two of the rioters. A constable, and a chowkidar, who were at the police station during the attack escaped, and these men have been traced, and it is believed that their statement will throw considerable light on the whole affair. Complete quiet has now been restored. The Commissioner, the Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police visited the scene immediately on receipt of information, and restored confidence among the village people and the railway and telegraph lines were quickly repaired. Mr. Sands, the Deputy Inspector General of Police, attended the funeral of the dead policemen. The authorities immediately after the incident, invited three prominent gentlemen of Gorakhpur, one of whom is a non-co-operato
U||r, to visit the scene of the tragedy.—The Pioneer February 9, 1922.

U||APPENDIX XIII
U||BENGAL
U||His Excellency's Speech at the St. Andrew's Day Dinner, on 30th November 1920
U||Gentlemen,
U||Among other things non-co-operation is to achieve is swaraj in one year. Mr. Gandhi has said so himself. The question is—do the people of Bengal want this particular form of swaraj? Being a shrewd and intelligent people they will doubtless wish to satisfy themselves first of all as to what precisely this swaraj is. Fortunately we are able to answer that question with authority, because Mr. Gandhi had issued a very clear explanation of what he means by swaraj in a small manual entitled 'Indian Home Rule', a new edition of which was published by Messrs. Ganesh & Co., of Madras, last year. I earnestly commend a perusal of it to all who are interested in the future of the land we live in....
U||Very well, if this is the sort of thing that people want by all means let them adopt non-co-operation. But I do not believe for a moment that this is what people want. And that, no doubt, is why we find so many other reasons advanced for adopting non-co-operation. It is claimed for it for example, that it is a saintly weapon in the hands of an oppressed people engaged in a righteous struggle against a tyrannous and unrighteous Government. Let us examine its credentials so that we may see to what extent the claim to righteousness can be sustained. In its earliest phase, when it was known as Satyagraha, its result were admittedly evil. The Hunter Committee was unanimous in its opinion that its effect was to engender "a familiarity and sympathy with disobedience to laws" and "to undermine the law abiding instincts which stand between society and outbreaks of violence at a time when their full strength was required." And, indeed, Mr. Gandhi himself confessed himself sorry that when he embarked upon a mass moveme
U||nt "he under-rated the forces of evil, and that he was obliged to pause and consider how best to meet the situation." Then {167} again another object of the non-co-operators is to re-impose Turkish Administration upon the non-Turkish peoples who have so long suffered under it. The fact that under Turkish administration calculated attempts have been made to exterminate the Armenian people—one of the most horrible chapters in the whole history of crime—is ignored, a matter for surprise, surely, in view of the innate abhorrence of violence professed by the originator of the movement. Indeed, any one making a comprehensive survey of the non-co-operation movement could scarcely be blamed if he came to the conclusion that the only password required to give admission to the non-co-operation camp was "race-hatred." And is Bengal going to tolerate a movement based upon hatred, and, therefore, rooted in evil? Surely the world has had its fill of hatred. Cast your eyes over the past six years, and what do you see? 
U||A world in agony. The peoples of this earth trailing their spectral way across a blood-soaked scene of destruction and desolation—a ghastly phantasmagoria of human suffering; a hideous calvary. Humanity in torment, scourged with sorrow, losing its hold upon hope, drifting derelict in a terrifying ocean of despair. That is what hatred has done for mankind. And is mankind going to tolerate those who would deliberately and of malice aforethought perpetuate this grisly tradition of hatred among men? Let us have the answer of the people of this country to that question. For myself I have faith in the better mind of the people of Bengal. Not for nothing did Job Charnock lay the foundations of this great city. The finger of destiny was even then tracing the future of Great Britain and India upon the rock of doom. For better or for worse our paths lie side by side. The policy of Great Britain has been fairly and frankly stated. We are inviting the people of India to co-operate with us in making and travelling over
U|| that road which will lead to an India fashioned in so far as its internal affairs are concerned in ever-increasing accordance with the genius of its peoples, and filling a position of ever increasing pride and honour in the great confederation of the British Empire. Can any one who has faith in the existence of an eternal and immutable principle of justice {168} and right doubt what the final choice of the people of India will be? Surely not. And it is with an unshakeable faith in its future that I give you the toast of "The Land We Live in."
U||His Excellency's Speech at the St. Andrew's Dinner, on 30th November 1921
U||India to-day is honoured by another distinguished guest—the most distinguished, indeed save only one, whom the citizens of the British Empire could welcome, namely, the heir to the Empire's Throne—His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. He has come with words of sympathy upon his lips and with feelings of affection in his heart for the "Land we live in." Can it be doubted, then that from all communities and all creeds he will receive a royal welcome? I confess that it was with amazement that I learned that there was a small section of people, in this land of all lands, who had so far forgotten the dictates of courtesy as to urge the boycott of the Royal visitor. The promoters of this movement claim, I believe, to represent the fine flower of the ancient culture and civilisation of India. Well one lives and learns. I had always been brought up to believe that courtesy towards a guest was a deep-rooted tradition with the Indian people. And so I still believe it to be, though there may be some who have forg
U||otten it. I do not believe that this attitude represents the real mind of India. Indeed, I know that it does not—for it was an Indian gentleman whose patriotism is beyond all possible question, who said to me when he read of the proposal "now must we bow our heads in shame for in showing rudeness to a guest we have touched the lowest depths of national humiliation and degradation." That, I believe, represents the best and, indeed, the real mind of India, for in India it has always been realised that discourtesy injures those who are guilty of it rather than those against whom it is practised, for it lowers them in the eyes of all right thinking men and indeed is sooner or later found by the man who is guilty of it to be a wound gnawing at his own self-respect...
U||Already long strides have been taken along the path towards the ultimate goal. Indian and European have come closer together—mutual {169} understanding and goodwill are springing up between them. How much more could be achieved in this direction were it not for the black cloud of anger and hatred which has been brought into being by the apostles of revolution. From my experience of the past 12 months I have no hesitation in saying that a wonderful new era would have dawned for India already, had it not been for the wild passions which have been let loose upon the land by those who have pinned their faith to revolution.
U||They call the Government "Satanic". Have they then a monopoly of righteousness? The wild lawlessness and bloodshed at Giridih, Malegaon, Alighar, Malabar, Bombay and many other places—do these things not savour of the work of Satan? These are, indeed, but the heralds of red revolution. Let them look deep into their hearts and ask themselves in all seriousness if the salvation of India lies along such lines....
U||His Excellency replying to the deputation of the representation of the people in the mufassal, held in Government House Calcutta on 2nd July 1921, said:—
U||Let me, therefore, repeat what I said a year ago. The facts are these: The Turkish troops in the fort at Mecca, in their attempts to overcome the Arabs who had rallied round the Sheriff bombarded the mosque containing the Kaaba. One of the Turkish shells actually struck the Kaaba, burned a hole in the holy carpet and killed nine persons who were kneeling in prayer. These are the facts. The outrage was committed by the Turks, and I solemnly and categorically affirm that the British had nothing whatsoever to do with it. This being so, can you or any one suggest any other motive for the propagation of such falsehoods except the desire to create hatred against the British?...
U||His Excellency's speech at the Legislative Council on 19th December 1921
U||Gentlemen,
U||I will not go further back than October last. At the beginning of that month a manifesto, signed by Mr. Gandhi and a large number of other prominent non-co-operators, laid it down that it {170} was the duty of every Indian soldier and Civilian to sever his connection with Government. There followed two important developments—an intensive campaign to undermine the loyalty of the police and a rapid development in the activities of "volunteer" corps. Alongside of these two significant developments was to be observed a rapid increase in open lawlessness and defiance of constituted authority. There were breaches of the peace in Howrah and Calcutta which are within the recollection of all. But such episodes were not confined to Calcutta. All over the Presidency persons were moving, stirring up dissatisfaction among the masses. This process was assisted by an intensive campaign of highly inflammatory speeches which had been in progress for some months past. Between the beginning of June and the middle of November
U||, I received reports of no less than 4,265 meetings held in different parts of the province. I could quote passages from these speeches which are so inflammatory, so violent in their abuse that they would shock the Council. I refrain from doing so for the sole reason that I do not want to excite feeling unnecessarily. But I can assure the Council that, addressed, as in nine cases out of ten these speeches have been, to audiences made up of the illiterate and emotional masses, they could have but one result, namely that of spreading broadcast feelings of hatred and disaffection and of goading the people to violence. And that, indeed, has already been the actual result. Assaults on Settlement Officers have taken place. Government servants have been threatened and boycotted. Now let me return to Calcutta; and I take the events of November 17th to illustrate the state of affairs which had been reached. The life of city was paralysed. Were the police provocative? Certainly not. On the contrary the almost universa
U||l complaint made to me was that the police remained inactive and refrained from making arrests.
U||I have now to inform the Council of the discovery on the night of December 8th of a number of sinister weapons concealed in an untenanted house in the heart of the town. The nature of these weapons left little doubt as to the sort of use to which they were intended to be put—swords ingeniously concealed in the handles {171} of umbrellas, daggers of a peculiarly vicious type, tulwars and jars of acid. Very well, then I would lay stress upon this—that with so many recent outbreaks of rioting in the streets of the city fresh in one's mind, and with these further evidences of the sort of activities which were in progress at the movement, it was not unreasonable as a precautionary measure to have recourse to a limited number of military patrols.
U||Only three days ago an Urdu manuscript leaflet was found posted up in the city of which the following is a translation:—
U||"What are you thinking about only? Just come face to face with your opponent. Let yourself be cut to pieces, even to death but do not let any loss come to the Khilafat. Do not look towards Bagdad, neither do you look towards the Army, but kill your enemy right and left. Do not let any of your enemy to be left unkilled if you see him, and do not think that you are alone, because you are being helped by Imam Mehdi, who is standing in front of you. Call him, just fly a flag in your hand and cry out Khoda, Khoda, beat a drum in the name of Din Muhammad throughout the lanes."
U||APPENDIX XIV
U||Governor's Warning
U||Calcutta, February 11
U||Speaking at the Trades Association dinner in Calcutta, Lord Ronaldshay, the Governor of Bengal, made a lengthy reference to the political outlook.
U||It would be the height of unwisdom, said His Excellency, to close one's eyes to the gravity of the situation with which not only the Government but society in the widest meaning of that term is now faced. It seems desirable to call attention to this because there still appear to be quite a number of people who in spite of all that has happened, in spite of the resort to violence which has characterised the Non-co-operation movement in Malabar, Malegaon, Giridih. Aligarh, Bombay and many other places have not yet grasped the seriousness or the nearness of the danger, with which the country is threatened.
U||{172} Take the case of the Non-co-operation volunteers. We are told by some that we ought to withdraw our notification under the Act of 1908 declaring these volunteer corps to be unlawful association. A recommendation to that effect has quite recently been made to the Government by the Legislative Council. It is true that under the existing constitution, we are still responsible to Parliament for the maintenance of law and order and though it would no doubt save us much trouble and anxiety if we were able to transfer the responsibility from our own shoulders to those of the Legislative Council, we cannot do so. Nevertheless I have always regarded it as my duty to consider with the utmost care any recommendations which the Council makes and in this case I am calling for special reports as to the nature and extent of the present activities of these volunteers in different parts of the province in order that I may have the fullest and most up-to-date information before me.
U||On the Defensive
U||In considering the matter in the meanwhile, I would point out to the public at large something which, judging by the criticism to which we are subjected, had been overlooked, namely, that from the very beginning of the Non-co-operation movement right up to the present time, the Government have been on the defensive. It is the Non-co-operators who have always attacked and by so doing have compelled the Government to take up weapons for its defence.
U||For example I have heard it suggested that the Government have goaded the Non-co-operators into Civil Disobedience by the measures which they have recently taken. Nothing could be further from the truth. The policy of civil disobedience was accepted by the All-India Congress Committee at the beginning of November and it was not until towards the end of that month that action against the volunteers was taken. Mr. Gandhi himself, in moving the civil disobedience resolution on November 4th defined civil disobedience as a civil revolution, which, wherever practised would mean the end of the Government's authority and open defiance of the Government and its laws.
U||{173} Well, that seems to be explicit enough and it seems a little unreasonable, surely, that those who profess to be opposed to such a revolution, should seriously urge the Government to lay aside the weapons, which it has only taken up to protect itself against, to use Mr. Gandhi's words once more "the destruction of its authority and the open defiance of its laws". Do those who object to these volunteer-corps being declared to be unlawful associations realise what these corps have been brought into existence for? They have no excuse for not knowing, because Mr. Gandhi has himself explained quite frankly the object, for which they are being recruited. He declared at the conference held in Bombay on January 14th that, even if a round table conference was to be held he would not stop the enlistment of volunteers for a single moment. Why, because the enlistment was a preparation for civil disobedience.
U||The Critics Answered
U||There can be no doubt on that point at all, for we have also the letter written by Pandit Kunzru to Mr. Jinnah, in which he states that Mr. Gandhi declared explicitly at the conference that the enrolment and training of volunteers for starting civil disobedience must be continued. Very well then, what we are asked to do is this: To declare that the volunteer corps enrolled and trained for civil disobedience are lawful associations. Do those who urge us to take this step regard civil disobedience as a lawful form of political activity? If they do not, by what process of reasoning, do they argue that the agency by which civil disobedience is to be carried out should be declared by Government to be a lawful agency?
U||Now let us consider for a moment what the Non-co-operators mean by civil disobedience in its most developed form. It has been explained by Mr. Dip Narayan Singh a leading Non-co-operator of Behar. The procedure is to be as follows;—The chief civil officer in the area selected for its operation is to be given seven days to hand over the district to the Non-co-operators. The residents in the area are then to be ordered to disobey all the orders and laws of the Government and to refuse to pay taxes, register documents, {174} and so on. At the same time the police station and courts are to be surrounded and the officials to be told to deposit their uniforms and other badges of office. The police stations and courts will then be treated as Swaraj property.
U||You well see that this bears out to the full declaration made by Mr. Gandhi, in moving the civil disobedience resolution at the meeting of the All-India Congress Committee on November 4th, that his programme of civil disobedience constitutes a civil revolution, which, wherever practised, will mean the end of the Government's authority and the open defiance of Government and its laws. Again I would ask, to those who wish these volunteers to be declared to be lawful wish to see this programme put into operation without a resort to violence, which will drench the country in blood?
U||The Lesson of Chauri Chaura
U||Even the milder forms of Non-co-operation activity such as picketing,—which is often claimed by the Non-co-operators to be peaceful pastime though even this claim is no longer maintained by Mr. Gandhi as I shall show in a moment—result in wild orgies of violence as we have been painfully reminded again, within the last few days by the horrible crime at Chauri Chaura in the United Provinces. This outbreak, in which 21 police men and chaukidars were violently beaten to death was deliberately organised, we are told, in the report from the Commissioners, by the volunteers, and if picketing results in orgies of murder and destruction of this kind what are likely to be results of attempts to put into operation the full pledged programme of Civil Disobedience to which I have already referred?
U||But it seems, as I have already remarked that Mr. Gandhi no longer maintains that all picketing is peaceful, for writing in his newspaper, "Young India" a short time ago, he says that in connection with the proposal for a round table conference his suggestion was that all picketing, except bona-fide peaceful picketing should be suspended pending the result of the conference. Clearly then, in Mr. Gandhi's opinion picketing is of two kinds, bona fide peaceful {175} picketing on the one hand, and picketing which is not bona fide and peaceful on the other. Very well then, Mr. Gandhi knows that picketing is not peaceful. He must know that the more drastic forms of civil disobedience, which he is now determined to embark upon, must lead to violence.
U||The Issue
U||Is it possible under these circumstances to come to any conclusion other than that reached by the Government of India, that the issue is no longer between this or that programme of political advance, but between lawlessness and all its dangerous consequences on the one hand, and on the other hand, the maintenance of those principles, which lie at the root of civilised Governments.
U||In Bengal civil disobedience has already taken the form in a number of districts of a refusal to pay the "chaukidari" tax, and I have already received complaints from landholders that tenants are refusing to pay their rent throughout the province.
U||A general spirit of contempt for authority and defiance of law and order is being fostered. Well, respect for lawful authority and a general willingness on the part of the people to observe the law are the pillars upon which the very existence of society rests. If these be cut away, society fall into the abyss of anarchy and is shattered. It is recorded of a famous figure in history that he fiddled while Rome was burning. The story is one which is not without its moral for the present day.
U||APPENDIX XV
U||Extracts from the speech of the Hon'ble Sir Henry Wheeler, Member in charge of Political Department
U||What is the situation with which we are faced? It is the outcome of a movement which, in pursuit of certain political aims, has resulted in every province in India in bloodshed, disorder and confusion. A concise picture of the all India situation is contained in the report of the committee which recently inquired into the {176} working of certain laws at Simla, and from it I quote their conclusion:—
U||Taking into consideration all the evidence we have received and the points to which we have adverted and bearing in mind the still prevailing economic discontent, we cannot dismiss as improbable the danger of sudden sectarian, agrarian or labour disorder on a large scale culminating in riots.
U||They give instances of what they call 34 notable cases of disorder which have occurred in India during the current year. That is, most briefly, the position in India as a whole.
U||Let me now give a few illustrations of the position in Bengal, with which we are more particularly concerned, for it is perhaps apt to be overlooked that the whole problem does not centre round Calcutta alone. There is outside this city this vast Presidency of 40 millions people, and the difficulties in the mufussal are just as acute as here. To cite an example—in the district of Rangpur we have lately had reported an organisation of volunteers under a district captain and four vice-captains, definitely named, supported by two subordinate officers in each thana and a regular budget and funds, which, in addition to the better known objects of the non-co-operation movement, had set before itself the following five aims.—
U||    The organisation of volunteers to be ready for civil disobedience;
U||    the preparation of the people to abstain from payment of chaukidari and union board tax;
U||    the preparation of the tenants to refrain from paying rents;
U||    the preparation of the people to boycott the thana and the law courts;
U||    to boycott higher grade police and other officers especially with regard to foodstuffs, and if as a result of this the Government start their own store and make local arrangements it is felt that it will be possible to place difficulties in the way of transport.
U||This last line has in fact been taken and the Collector had to improvise supplies of food to various thanas and registration office. {177} The Council will have noticed the use of the term "civil disobedience," and in two other districts—namely, Noakhali and Faridpur—we have had the usual phenomena of a little knot of men forming themselves into a committee and saying: "We will have civil disobedience." What is civil disobedience understood to mean? Lest it be thought that it is merely an abstract subject for discussion, say, in a newspaper article, let me refer to an interesting definition of the term which we have recently had from a neighbouring province. The president of a meeting there lately outlined civil disobedience in the following terms:—
U||A notice calling upon Government to grant Swaraj within seven days will first be served upon the chief civil officer present in the locality selected for civil disobedience. Subsequently the residents of the particular locality will be directed to disobey all orders and laws of Government and to refuse to pay taxes, register documents, etc. At the same time police stations and courts will be surrounded and the officials told to deposit their uniforms and other badges of office. Thereafter police-stations and courts will be treated as Swaraj property. That is a position which, I put in to the Council, can be summed up in one word, "anarchy." That is the civil disobedience which is being preached, and which, if we are to believe the three speeches which we have just heard, is a little excitement which, in the words of one speaker, can be disposed of by a "flick of a handkerchief."
U||Now, Sir, I could carry on these examples from the mufassal to Chittagon, which has been in a state of disturbance and agitation since April last, and to Howrah where disturbances have been intermittent throughout the year, culminating in firing in the streets and in the death of a policeman. But the chronicle is too long, and I pass to Calcutta, where the remarks of His Excellency have fortunately shortened my task. We are all aware that the incessant stream of inflammatory oratory and agitation in Calcutta culminated on the 17th November in a paralysis of the life of the city and I was even surprised, when refreshing my memory as to those events, to see how openly what was done was gloried in by the leaders of the non-co-operation movement as {178} having been done by their orders and direction. They were good enough to define in their instructions who might go about the streets and who might not, I have seen the statement that by the kindness of the Congress and the Khilafat committees certain shops would
U|| be allowed to open at 12 noon. There has never been any attempt to conceal the fact that the town was at that time, in the view of the non-co-operators, subject to their orders—subject by the processes of intimidation with which we are well acquainted.
U||Now if that was the position—and I submit that this is a correct statement of the position—Government was obviously confronted with the question of what they were to do. Was this state of affairs to continue or was it to be checked? We were approached on all sides, in this Council and by such responsible bodies as the British Indian Association, to intervene and to restore some measure of law and order in a condition of things which was fast drifting to chaos. In these circumstances we took the measures of which the Council is well aware, namely, to declare certain associations to be illegal, to introduce the Seditious Meetings Act in one district and prohibit by order of the Commissioner of Police, meetings and processions in Calcutta. I put it to the Council that short of these measures it would not have been possible to comply with the urgent requests so reasonably made to us from so many quarters to intervene in the interests of decent administration. That is the issue which is before the Council. Is
U|| it or is it not a fact that on the 17th of last month the people of this city were disgusted with the state of affairs and the prevailing terrorism? Is it or is it not a fact that constant pressure was brought to bear on Government by all sections of the people to bring about a better state of affairs? Can it in truth be said that the action of Government in attempting to curtail the activities of the gentlemen to whom the excitement is due has gone beyond the necessity of the case? If so, what is the alternative which the Council would place before Government? Of that, however we have heard singularly little, except from Babu Surendra Nath Mallik, who advises us to withdraw all our orders, release prisoners, {179} reduce sentences and place on their trial the military and the police—a solution which, I trust, will not commend itself to the better sense of the Council....
U||APPENDIX XVI
U||BEHAR AND ORISSA
U||The Speech of the Hon. Mr. Macpherson, Member of Government, at the meeting of the Legislative Council Patna,
U||24th January 1922
U||Sir, I desire to intervene at this stage of the debate, because I think it is proper that the House should know what the facts of the situation are before they make speeches and commit themselves to views which I hope they will be prepared to change after they know what the facts of the situation really are. I must ask your indulgence, if I find that what I have to say on this important occasion will take me beyond the usual time limits.
U||This is not the first occasion on which the Government of Behar and Orissa have explained to the public their attitude towards the non-co-operation movement and their reasons for the action taken on the 10th December last, which forms the subject of this Resolution. As the council is well aware, His Excellency the Governor received, a few days after that date, an influential deputation of Council Members and explained to them under what circumstances Government had been forced in defence of the public safety to take action under the criminal Law Amendment Act. An account of that deputation was published in all the newspapers which are commonly read in this Province and I trust it has been carefully perused by all the members of Council. I shall be pardoned if, when I come to discuss the expediency of action taken by Government, I go over again the ground covered by the communique which was issued on that occasion. {180}
U||What was the position with which the Local Government were faced in the beginning of that month? During the past twelve months they have seen these associations growing in number and boldness, spreading unrest throughout the public life of the Province, poisoning and confusing the minds of simple people, interfering with liberty of action, and not infrequently having to resort to force in order to compel obedience to their mandates. I have here a long list of cases in which persuasion was supplemented by force, sometimes force of a very disgraceful kind but I will not worry the Council by citing instances. This Province was not alone in these experiences, the organization of a volunteer revolutionary army was proceeding apace in neighbouring provinces also. The danger was being gradually realized by the Government of India and by other Local Governments, and before the end of November action under the Criminal Law Amendment Act had been taken by the Governments of the Punjab, the United Provinces Delhi, Beng
U||al, and Assam. The Government of Bihar and Orissa stayed their hand till further inaction would have been criminal folly. The two circumstances which brought matters to a head in this province were
U||    the immediate imminence of the introduction of the civil disobedience movement, particularly in the Tirhut Division, and,
U||    the intensive preparations which were being made to organize a hostile hartal in Patna City against the visit of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales on the 22nd and 23rd December. I know that certain local non-co-operation leaders have denied that there was any intention to start the civil disobedience movement within the Province during the month of December or even up to the present date, and we have been told that the Patna Hartal was a spontaneous movement on the part of the citizens. I think the Council will not be deceived by either of these assurances. After all Government had to follow the evidence at their disposal. There is one well-known leader {181} of the local non-co-operation camp, called Mr. Dip Narayan Singh. At a meeting held at Bhagalpur on the 16th November this gentleman outlined the programme which the leaders intended to follow. According to him a notice calling upon Government to grant Swaraj within seven days would first be served upon the chief civil officer present in the lo
U||cality selected for civil disobedience, subsequently the residents of the particular locality would be directed to disobey all orders and laws of Government and to refuse to pay taxes, register documents, etc. At the same time police stations and courts would be surrounded and the officials told to deposit their uniforms and other badges of offices. Thereafter police stations and courts would be treated as Swaraj property. On the top of this declaration of policy, the Local Government had information that the first experiment would be made with the Basantpur police station in the Chapra District. Now this has been denied by the Congress party but the intention was an open secret. I was told about it after our last session by a member of this Council, who shall be nameless, and apart from our police reports, we had it on the authority of the Motherland dated the 26th November, that Chapra had been selected as the first object of attack. This is what the Motherland of November 29th, 1921, says. The heading is
U||
U||"Civil Disobedience in Behar."
U||And the message runs:
U||"A meeting of the Provincial Congress Committee was held at Patna on Sunday last. 33 delegates were elected for the coming session of the Indian National Congress at Ahmadabad. It was also resolved upon to form a volunteer corps in pursuance of the resolution of the All India Working Committee. The matter of selecting a suitable area for preparing it for Civil Disobedience was referred to the Provincial Working Committee which met on Monday last and decided in favour of Chapra in preference to the {182} claims of Katra Thana in the district of Muzaffarpur, which were backed up by Muhammad Shafi."
U||The Motherland is a local organ of the revolutionary party and the property of Mr. Mazharul Haqq, who is the one of the shining lights in that camp, and presumably is in the confidance of the party. We know also from the public press that the previous volunteer associations, our old friends, the 'Khilafat' the 'Congress' and the 'Swaraj' volunteers were to be replaced by a new organization to be called the "National Volunteers" and we knew from our own reports that the particular name to be affected by the new organization of non-violent volunteers in Behar was the Qaumi Sebak Dal. Perhaps members of this Council would like to know something about the organization of this Behar Sebak Dal. This is what we heard about its organization.
U||Each squad was to consist of 20 volunteers. 20 squads would make a company Maha Dal, in this there would be 400 volunteers. Each squad would be under an officer.
U||Over 20 assistants there would be a higher officer. What he would dictate all the four hundred volunteers would have to observe.
U||The Bihar Sebak Dal's duty would be "Revolution" even if they had to sacrifice their lives.
U||And this is what we were told about their plans of campaign:
U||It was first to attack all the police-stations of the district and to take them into their possession, after removing the Inspectors, Jamadars and the Police.
U||When the thana had been taken possession of, then the Kachahri would have to be taken possession of and the Hakims would be removed.
U||Civil disobedience would commence in Chapra District from village Basantpur, in Muzaffarpur from thana Katra, and then Sitamarhi.
U||Such then was the information on which the Local Government had to act. Does the Council still wonder that action of the nature taken was taken? To those who protest that the information {183} held by Government was unreliable I can only reply that it has been fully corroborated not only by what has happened in other Provinces and by published documents of the non-co-operation movement but also by what has happened under our very noses in this Province. The non-co-operators say that it was never in contemplation to make an attack on Basantpur police-station on the 10th December. We believe that this particular experiment was nipped to the bud by the Notification of the same date, which found the leaders assembled at Chapra and threw them into consternation. But how do they explain the raids which were actually made at a somewhat later date on the police-station of Sonbarsa, Raghupur and Mahua in the District of Muzaffarpur, or the attempt to picket the Gaya Civil Courts on the opening day after the X'mas hol
U||idays, which was only frustrated by the despatch of troops from Patna to Gaya on the previous evening? Were all these fortuitous and accidental? Do all these evidences of intention exist only in the heated imagination of the police? I shall have occasion later to tell the Council what effect these raids have had on the internal condition of the Muzaffarpur District. My present object is only to prove that when the Local Government took action under the Criminal Law Amendment Act on the 10th December, they were fully justified in believing that the civil disobedience movement would be started at a very early date in the Tirhut Division.
U||I do not wish to weary the Council by going into details regarding the Patna hartal. It seemed to Government, and with good reason, that efforts were being made to impose an intolerable tyranny on the citizens of Patna at a time when the representatives of the people, who sit in this Council, had extended to his Royal Highness a most cordial welcome and had voted a special grant to make that welcome worthy of the occasion. The object of the non-co-operators was to substitute for the welcome the same kind of deliberate insult that had been attempted to be offered to the Royal visitor at Benares and Allahabad. Government, I say, would have been open to the gravest reproach if it had made no effort to counteract that mean and wicked project, which was so {184} foreign to the innate hospitality and reverence of the Indian people, and particularly repugnant, one would imagine, to the sturdy loyalty of Bihar. Under this double compulsion then Government decided that the time had come to follow the example of its n
U||eighbours. Members of Council know as well as I do what followed. There was, as Government expected there would be, much excitement in the city—the stirring of a hornet nest always has this sort of reaction.
U||Sir, let not this Council be deceived by any cry of repression, by any false appeal for the freedom of association and the freedom of speech. This Government is not out for repression. It has no desire to interfere with political activity or freedom of speech. When Mr. Gandhi and his friends use these phrases, what they mean is license to preach sedition, and liberty to foment rebellion and revolution. Let us see how the system works in practice. I will read to the Council a recent report on condition of the Muzaffarpur District. It is dated the 5th January:—
U||"The Muzaffarpur District still continues to be in very disturbed state particularly the Sitamarhi Subdivision, where it is reported that law and order are decreasing daily and Magistrates are even insulted in their own Courts. The Sitamarhi Sub-jail is said to be practically in a state of mutiny, the prisoners shouting and singing all day until about 10 P.M., while on one occasion a warder was rushed and knocked down. Additional police have been asked for this subdivision and are badly required. The Masses in this district are said to have no longer any dread of going to jail owing to the inducements held out to them that they will be treated as political prisoners and fare better than in their own homes. The police have come in for more than their fair share of attention from the non-co-operators during the week and the Superintendent of Police is of opinion that his force has become exasperated almost beyond endurance by the gross insults and abuse that has been heaped upon them.
U||"On the 26th December 1921, about 200 volunteers escorted by a large and noisy mob forced their way into the Sonbarsa Thana compound in the Sitamarhi Subdivision, carrying swaraj flag and {185} repeating the Delhi fatwa. The thana police were told that to remain in Government service was for a Hindu equivalent to eating cow's flesh and for a Muhammadan to eating pig. Later the crowd became more insulting and abusive and though seven of the ringleaders were arrested, the crowd did not disperse until nearly midnight. Following this incident the whole of the thana staff were boycotted, the services of the barber, washermen and even supplies of food were stopped, until the divisional inspector succeeded in intervening.
U||"At Raghupur Police-station in the same district, 300 volunteers appeared and told the sub-inspector that on the 1st January they would plant the swaraj flag in the compound and take possession of the police-station. At Mahua Police-station, the Police were also grossly abused and insulted and similar reports have been received by the Superintendent of Police from other police stations in the district.
U||"Mention was made in last week's report of a fracas in the Court compound at Hajipur where alms were being distributed to the poor. This was followed on the same day by a parade of 100 Sevak Dal volunteers in front of the Hajipur police-station who shouted Sarkar ki nokri karna haram hai and grossly abused the Police.
U||"Reports received from factories also indicate a serious state of unrest in the Mufassal. Mr. G. P. Danby writing from Bowarrah factory mentions that noisy shouting bands of volunteers are moving about the country making themselves a general nuisance and that to all appearance mob law prevails. The Belsand Factory in this district is reported to have been surrounded on the 4th January by a large mob shouting Gandhi ki jai. Europeans and loyal Indians are expressing their disappointment that Government did not continue strong measures against the non-co-operation movement."
U||That is a police report, and lest the Council may think it is highly coloured I will read a shorter note of the Divisional Commissioner, Mr. Scroope, who is a man of sober judgment.
U||Mr. Mansfield, Subdivisional Officer Sitamarhi, came to see {186} me yesterday before I left for Bankipur. He is a level-headed officer and in no sense an alarmist. He informed me that the police are no longer able to deal with non-co-operators in Sitamarhi town. The latter are practically in possession of the liquor shops which they now picket with impunity. They also haunt the neighbourhood of the Court and create much noise and disorder during the trial to political cases. They ask to be arrested and some of them who have been placed under trial under section 290, Indian Penal Code have been grossly insulting to the Magistrate. The journeys to and from Court of persons under trial for a political offence are made regular occasions for noisy demonstrations and abuse of Government. Mr. Mansfield's considered opinion is that non-co-operators are now entirely out of hand, that the existing police force is quite unequal to the task of keeping them in check and that law and order have practically ceased to exis
U||t in Sitamarhi town.
U||The sub-jail can only be described as in a state of mutiny. It is much overcrowded containing about 90 inmates (I am not certain of the exact number; almost all are under trials) and certain influential non-co-operators under trials have been preaching defiance and insubordination to their companions. The result is a total absence of discipline; the undertrials sing and shout at the top of their voices throughout the day and most of the night and any attempts on the part of the warders to enforce order and obedience are wholly ignored.
U||Here is a latter report of the doings of one of these roving bands of whom mention is made in the police report. The Superintendent of Police writes on the 21st January.
U||At the same time I received a telegram from Mr. Gray, Meanchupra.
U||"All roads here stopped by volunteers. No carts or servants allowed works. Come if possible, position critical".
U||I left at 2 P.M. and arrived Meanchupra at about 3 P.M.
U||About 500 yards on the road west of Meanchupra I found some volunteers sitting on a culvert guarding the road. On arrival at the Bungalow I found Mr. and Mrs. Gray and their three children {187} absolutely shut off and isolated by three volunteers. All the Factory work had been stopped as the jamadar peons and coolies were not allowed to enter the factory so that there was no one to cut the sugarcane etc. All carts had been stopped, volunteers cutting the ropes of the bullocks and driving them away. Even the house servants had been stopped from going to the bungalow from their village. There was no bearer, cooks mashalchi, dhobe, garden coolies or even murgiwala. Mrs. Grey had to dig up the potatoes in the garden, cook the food, wash up the dishes, etc., and her ayah asked her (as well she might) if it was true that the British Raj was over.
U||Sir, these are the facts which have already compelled Government to post a force of additional police to the Sitamarhi subdivision, and I do not disguise from the Council that they may force us at no distant date to take even sterner measures to preserve the peace of the district, and of other districts that are similarly threatened. If Government find it necessary later to present to Council a bill of costs which will not be at all to their liking, let them thank their non-co-operation friends for the gift.
U||I know we shall be met with the old cry of repression, but in this case it is a stupid cry. No Government of this country wants repression for repression's sake, and least of all the Government of Bihar and Orissa, which includes within its number three distinguished Indians who have never been accused of any lack of political independence. For my own part I claim that no one welcomed more keenly than I did the inauguration of the new reforms era in India. I had the confident hope (and in this matter I speak also for my hon'ble colleague, Sir Havilland Le Mesurier) that we had before us a great and inspiring task of friendly co-operation with educated Indians, which would at no very distant date place this country in the forefront of the common-wealth of nations. Sir, this great task has for the moment been heavily handicapped and hampered by the poisonous cult of non-co-operation, a cult which has embittered and clouded the political life of India and caused discouragement to all the friends of reform. It h
U||as made life a {188} burden and weariness to all ranks of Government officers, to the responsible agents of Government in districts and to the directing staff at headquarters but I have still hope that the better sense of India will prevail and that the clouds will clear away. It is to you, members of the Council, that Government look to give a lead to the public which you represent, in the fight against this great danger which menaces India. The danger is not one which threatens only the officers of Government, professional men, and men of wealth and property. The interests of the common people, the patient cultivators and the toiling workmen, are just as much at stake. It is they who will suffer most, if revolution comes, as the same classes are suffering to-day in Russia where they are perishing in millions as a result of the disintegration of ordered Government. I call therefore upon the representatives of all classes in this assembly to consider what is their duty, their solemn duty, on this occasion. T
U||he choice is between the orderly progress of India towards a future of brightest promise and the perilous path of revolution which leads to darkness and death. There is no midway between them. I appeal to you, gentlemen of the Council, to put aside any pre-conceived notions or prepared speeches with which you may have entered this hall to-day and to look at the position in all its naked truth. The question you have to decide for yourself is whether you stand for orderly Government or revolution. I trust that the hon'ble mover himself will realize his responsibility in the light of these remarks and withdraw his resolution now that it has served its purpose of securing a full discussion of the political situation.
U||{189}
U||APPENDIX XVII
U||Disgraceful Tyranny
U||The following is taken from the speech delivered by the Hon. Mr. Hammond, the officiating Chief Secretary of the Bihar and Orissa Government, during the recent debate in the Provincial Council on the political situation. The Pioneer 1st February, 22.
U||Has the hon. member read what has just happened in Guntur, in Madras, where rents are being withheld? Is he aware that not in one but in two or three districts in the Province there have been refusals to pay chaukidari taxes; that we have read not one but several speeches advocating this refusal? May I tell the Council that barely three or four days ago, in the district of Puri, a Panch assessor was murdered while endeavouring to collect chaukidari tax? Swami Vidyanand and others who followed and desclaimed against repressive laws enquired what have the "volunteers" done? It is a pertinent question, and, with your permission, Sir, I will give a few instances by way of answer. Time does not allow me to go through all their nefarious activities, but if Hon. members want to know what the "volunteers" have done, apart from enforced hartal and the ordinary common forms of secret intimidation, ask the widow of the Mahomedan, Mazir Ali Kalal, whose corpse was exhumed in Ranchi, thrown upon the public road and the f
U||ace beaten in with a brick; ask Gopi Khar at Chatra, who on the 3rd January was beaten and taken with his face blackened through the town because his wife committed the foul crime of selling food to those who visited liquor shops. Is that persuasion? Is this Ahimsa? ask the woman of Kateya, Mussammatt Paremia Koerin, near Siwan, who was stripped naked and driven through the village by a howling mob. She complained as well she might to the Government police officer, who, when he went to hold an enquiry was attacked by a mob—a demonstration in force of soul-force! A speaker later in the debate declaimed against those, the Planters and the police, whose courage, he said, "took the form of delight in tyrannising over the poor and of oppressing their fellow-countrymen." I ask in all sincerity what are these cases I have related but a disgraceful tyranny; are they not, indeed, 'oppression of the poor?' "What right?" I shall be asked "have you to lay these crimes at the doors of the non-co-operation party?" The a
U||nswer is, that when men publicly oppose the funeral {190} it is not irrational to believe that they are concerned with the subsequent exhumation of the corpse. In the other cases I have mentioned evidence has been taken and there is the judicial finding.
U||North and South of the Ganges
U||Another member asked me to explain the difference between the positions north and south of the Ganges. Let us take this town of Patna. The hon. member did not, as some do, deny in toto that, there had been intimidation. I say there is in fact but little difference. In Tirhut the crime manifest and overt, and in Patna it is suppressed. Have the Council heard of those poor beggars who received tickets entitling to go to Gulzarbagh on the morning of the 22nd December and get blankets? Do they know that these people were asked by "volunteers" on their way to show their tickets which were then taken and torn up, that the same day some of the beggars when returning from Gulzarbagh were deprived of the blankets which they had been given which were burnt, and the beggars had to be content with such warmth, as they could derive from the glow of enforced patriotism. The difference between this side of the Ganges and the other is that in Patna such things do not unfortunately in a large city attract much attention.
U||Oh! the shame of it, a blind beggar woman deprived of her blanket, but no violence of course was used, only soul-force. Babu Ganesh Dutt appealed to justice and sympathy. Do these beggars deserve no sympathy? Is there to be no justice done on their oppressors? I shall be told that the leaders of the movement disavow such action; that they deplore them as much as we do. Sir, we cannot separate the methods from the ideals of the revolutionary movement. I am prepared to believe that some of the leaders deplore violence and would try to restrain it, but I maintain, and I challenge, any hon. member here to disprove it that, conducted on the lines as it is, admitting such members as it does to its ranks, the non-co-operation movement must inevitably result in violence.
U||The Giridih Riots
U||Let us take the case to which reference had been made before in this Council, the serious riots which occurred at Giridih, and {191} which ended in an attack upon the sub-jail and the thana and the burning of the records. From what did that originate? It is a simple story. A sold B a cow and said that she would yield 1½ seers of milk. B took the cow away and found that he did not get the guaranteed amount of milk. Lawyers here know that the law of warranty is a somewhat difficult and intricate matter. However the local self constituted Panches decided that, A should take back the cow and refund the money. He declined to do so; and then as sanction to enforce the orders of this local court applied that cruel engine of oppression, social boycott. In all civilised communities the black-mailer is regarded with disgust and condemned. It has been for the non-co-operation party to use social blackmail as the basis of sanction to its ideals. The inevitable result of such a sanction is violence.
U||What are the "volunteers" doing? They are fishing in troubled waters. They tried—let us once again come back to Patna—to get the domestic servants to strike: they succeeded in persuading some of the motor-car drivers to desert their masters when their services were most required. What are the "volunteer's" doing? They are persuading raiyats to withhold rent. I know the case of a wealthy zamindar who had to borrow money from the bank to pay his Government revenue. I maintain, sir, that though honest men amongst the non-co-operators speak of non-violence the movement must inevitably lead to violence.
U||Take an instance from private life—let us again quote from Patna. A gentleman returning from Calcutta, a man well acquainted with the law of the land, found that his servant had, at the bidding of one gentleman who is an active recruiting officer of "volunteers," decided to break the contract made with his master. I have the best authority for saying this breach of contract resulted in righteous indignation which took the form of personal violence. What are these "volunteers" doing? They are provoking violence; they are picketing; they are intimidating; they are interfering between the master and servant, between landlord and tenant, between the railway and its employees.
U||{192}
U||"Volunteers" Recruited from Criminal Classes
U||I know it will be said that efforts have been made to purify the ranks. It was found, for example, in Chapra, that doms, registered as criminal tribes, were enlisted in the ranks of the national "volunteers." From the other districts, too, came reports of ex-convicts and persons of the "C" class register not only being enrolled but being welcomed. The efforts to remove these members and to purify the movement does not seem likely to be successful if we may judge from a leader's experience in the Bhagalpur Division, at Banka, in the district of Bhagalpur. There I am informed, when he visited some villages with a view to expelling the undesirables, he was himself expelled and told to mind his own business. I submit, sir, for the earnest consideration of this Council that you can not separate principles from methods or the ideals from the agents who are employed. Lastly, we have had an appeal that this Council should share the responsibility for maintenance of law and order. We have been solemnly advised by som
U||e of the speakers that Government should abdicate from the duty imposed by Statute of maintaining law and order in favour of these "volunteers" who were, so we are asked to believe, inaugurated solely to prevent a recurrence of the scenes that occurred in Bombay—to stop women being stripped of their clothes in the streets, to stop murder and loot. Can Government for a moment, in view of the activities I have related, contemplate handing over the duty, the primary and essential duty of the police, to the Kanmi Sevak Dal? The question has only to be asked to show its absurdity.
U||The question of Counter-Propaganda
U||The only piece of practical advice we received from Mr. Madan was that propaganda should be met by counter propaganda. But there are difficulties.
U||First how many of the hon. members would be willing to take up the task of propaganda? Secondly, how many of them would be listened to if they did? How many of these would be able to obtain a hearing? I confess it seems {193} to me, when Hon. members have protested that Government do not publish all the facts, that the time may come when every district and Sub-Divisional Magistrate ought to be his own publicity officer. In the last week we should have had stories in the papers of ladies being insulted in Monghyr, pushed into the road, and spat upon. We should have read of the wife of a settlement Officer, with her sister-in-law, being insulted by school-boys one of the ladies having her head cut with a stone; and from many districts we should have heard that pitiful tale of little children whose lips can hardly lisp the popular war cry being taught to shout it, not as a tale of admiration for an ascetic idealist, nor as reverence for a person of mystic magnetism, but as a mark of racial hatred, a hymn of hat
U||e. We could have published instances from Muzaffarpur and Champaran of the insults to Europeans, of mob roaming about shouting and committing mischief. Hon. members would have heard of Magistrates unable to hold trials because of the noise in the Court compounds. All these and more should have been done in the way of counter propaganda, exposing the methods of what is in fact a revolutionary movement, but would much good have been done thereby? Is it not more important to take steps to prevent such things happening? I ask the hon. members to remember that every vote given in favour of this resolution is a direct encouragement to the non-co-operation party they profess to abhor.
U||APPENDIX XVIII
U||DEMAND FOR AN INDIAN "REPUBLIC"
U||Mr. Hazrat Mohani's Address
U||Ahmedabad, Dec. 30—The following is the full text of the authorised translation of the address, which Moulana Hazrat Mohani delivered this afternoon and which was, from the beginning to the end a plea for the declaration from the 1st January, 1922, of an Indian Republic called the United States of India to be attained {194} by all possible and proper means, including guerilla warfare in case Martial Law was proclaimed.
U||Gentlemen—While thanking you for electing me to preside over this session of the All-India Muslim League I wish to say in all sincerity that the importance of this session of the League, in which the faith of Hindustan is to be decided required the choice of a person abler than myself, such as Moulana Muhammed Ali, Dr. Kitchlew or Moulana Abdul Kulam Azad to preside over its deliberation but, unfortunately, the Government has forcibly taken away the first two gentlemen from us, I express my inability to accept the responsibility. Consequently, as the proverb goes, "if thou dos't not accept it willingly, it will be forced on thee" this great duty was placed on my weak shoulders. I wish to discharge it to the best of my ability. Success is in the hand of God.
U||The Aims of the League
U||The present condition of the League appears to be very weak, indeed, but this does not in the least derogate from its real importance for it was the All-India Muslim League which actually realised. The first and the most essential condition of Indian independence is the Hindu-Muslim unity, and now that it has been achieved it is the duty of the League to maintain it also. Besides, it is on the platform of the League that all sections of political opinion amongst the Musalmans, Extremists or Moderates, have so far been and in future will, probably, be brought together. Before going into the causes of the weakness of the League, it will be better to enumerate the aims and object of the League. These are (1) the attainment of Swaraj by the people of India by all peaceful and legitimate means; (2) to protect and advance the political, religious and other rights and interests of the Indian Musalmans; (3) to promote friendship and union between the Musalmans and other communities of India and (4) to maintain and s
U||trengthen brotherly relations between the Musalmans of India and those of other countries.
U||The League an Old Calendar
U||The first of these is also known to be the creed of the Congress. Therefore, so long as the word Swaraj is not defined in consonance {195} with Muslim desire and the means for its attainment are not amplified, it is only natural that Muslim interests in League should be clear. The third object, Hindu-Muslim unity, is the common object both of the League and the Congress. The fourth object, the unity of Muslim world, which has been, along with other questions, connected with the Khilafat has been specially taken up by the Khilafat Committee. There remains only the second object that is the protection of the special interest of the Muslmans. As to this, so long as a much greater and more important object, that is, the attainment of Swaraj still remains unachieved, people would rather direct their united efforts against the common enemy than look after their special interests. They will be attended to when the time comes for it. As if these causes were not sufficient in themselves, to decrease Muslim influence 
U||in the League, its rules and regulations were, unfortunately, so framed that, while public opinion has developed at a rapid pace most members of the League have not moved an inch from their first position. As a result, the League remains nothing more than an old calendar. It is very necessary to remove the causes of the weakness of the League and to remove them immediately, for in proportion as we approach nearer and nearer to the goal of Swaraj the need of the League will be felt more and more, because questions of special Muslim rights will rise again with greater importance when India is free.
U||An Indian "Republic"
U||Our first duty, therefore, should be to reduce the fee for the membership of the League and thus increase its members, who will choose their representatives of the League every year. The members to the Council of the Provincial and the All-India Muslim Leagues should be chosen as in the case of the Congress every year. But the most pressing necessity of all is a change in the first object of the League to suit the changed Muslim conditions. Everyone of us knows that the word Swaraj has been definitely left vague and undefined in the creed of the Congress. The object of it has been that, if the Khilafat and the Panjab wrongs, are {196} settled on the lines of our demands, then Swaraj within the British Empire will be considered sufficient; otherwise efforts will be directed towards the attainment of complete independence. But, gentlemen from the Muslim point of view it is not enough that we should stand for complete independence alone. It is necessary to decide upon the form that it should take and in my opin
U||ion it can only be an Indian Republic or on the lines of the United States of India.
U||Besides this, the term "peaceful", which defines and restricts the scope of the legitimate means for the attainment of Swaraj in the Congress creed, is opposed to the nature and religious aspirations of the Musalmans. Therefore, in the creed of the League the words "possible" and "Proper" should be substituted for the words "Legitimate" and "Peaceful". I will explain the matter in detail. The Musalmans should understand clearly that they derive a two-fold advantage from the establishment of an Indian Republic, firstly, the general benefit which they will undoubtedly share along with their Indian brethren as citizens of a common State and secondly, the special advantage which the Musalmans will derive from it is that, with every decline in the prestige and power of the British Empire, which, to-day is the worst enemy of Muslim countries, the Muslim world will get breathing time and opportunity to improve its conditions. Gentlemen, in spite of the present Hindu-Muslim unity, there still exists many serious mis
U||understandings and suspicions between these two great communities of Hindustan, and it is of primary importance that we should grasp the true nature of these misunderstandings. The Hindus have a lurking suspicion that given an opportunity, the Musalmans will either invite their co-religionists from outside to invade India or will, at least help them, in case they invaded to plunder and devastate Hindustan, and these misunderstandings are so deep-rooted and widespread that, so far as my knowledge goes, no Indian statesman has escaped it, except the late Lokamanya Tilak. On the other hand, the Musalmans suspect that on the achievement of Self-Government, the Hindus will acquire greater political powers and will use their numerical {197} superiority to crush the Musalmans. Gentlemen, it is quite clear that these misunderstandings can only be won over by a compromise discussion and mutual and intimate knowledge, and it is an essential condition of this mutual understanding that the third party should not come be
U||tween them.
U||Hindus and Muslims
U||The generality of Musalmans, with few exceptions, are afraid of the numerical superiority of the Hindus and are absolutely opposed to an ordinary reform scheme as a substitute for complete independence. The primary reason for this is that in a merely reformed, as contrasted with an independent Government they will be under a double suspicion, first, a subjection to the Government of India, which will be common to Hindus and Musalmans, secondly, a rejection by a Hindu majority, which they will have to face in every department of the Government. On the other hand, if the danger of the English power is removed, the Musalmans will only have the Hindu Majority to fear. Fortunately this fear is such as will be automatically removed, with the establishment of the Indian republic for, while the Musalmans, as a whole, are in a minority in India, yet Nature has provided a compensation, for the Musalmans are not in a minority in all Provinces. In some Provinces, such as Kashmere, the Punjab, Sind, Bengal and Assam, the
U|| Musalmans are more numerous than the Hindus. This Muslim majority will be an assurance that in the United States of India the Hindu majority in Madras, Bombay and the United Provinces will not be allowed to overstep the limits of moderation against the Musalmans. Similarly, so long as a completely liberated India does not come into the hands of the Hindus and Musalmans themselves, the Hindus will be always suspicious that, in case of a foreign invasion, the Musalmans will aid their co-religionist invaders, but on the establishment of the Indian Republic, which will be shared in common by the Musalmans and Hindus there will be no possibility of such a suspicion, for no Musalman will desire that the power of even a Muslim foreigner should be established over this country.
U||{198}
U||The Mopla Rebellion
U||Gentlemen, I have just stated it as a necessary condition of the Hindu-Muslim compromise that the third party, the English, should not be allowed to step in between us. Otherwise, all our affairs will fall into disorder. Its best example is before you in the shape of the Mopla incident. You are probably aware that Hindu India has an open and direct complaint against the Moplas and an indirect complaint against all of us that the Moplas are plundering and spoiling their innocent Hindu neighbours, but probably, you are not aware that the Moplas justify their action on the ground that at such a critical juncture, when they are engaged in a war against the English, their neighbours not only do not help them or observe neutrality, but aid and assist the English in every possible way. They can, no doubt, contend that, while they are fighting a defensive war for the sake of their religion and have left their houses, property and belongings and taken refuge in hills and jungles, it is unfair to characterise as plund
U||er their commandeering of money, provisions and other necessaries for their troops from the English or their supporters. Gentlemen, both are right in their complaints, but so far as my investigation goes, the cause of this mutual recrimination can be traced to the interference of the third party. It happens thus, whenever any English detachment suddenly appears in the locality and kills or captures the Moplas inhabitants of the place, rumour somehow spreads in the neighbourhood that the Hindu inhabitants of the place had invited the English army for their protection, with the result that after the departure of the English troops the Moplas or their neighbours do not hesitate to retaliate and consider the money and other belongings of the Hindus as lawful spoils of war taken from those who have aided and abetted the enemy. Where no such events have occurred, the Moplas and Hindus even now live peacefully side by side, Moplas do not commit any excesses against the Hindus, while the Hindus do not hesitate in he
U||lping the Moplas to the best of their ability.
U||{199}
U||A National Parliament.
U||I have wandered far from my purpose, I meant to emphasise that, in the first clause dealing with the aims and objects of the League, the word "Swaraj" should be defined as complete republic. Otherwise, there is a danger that in the presence of a third party, Self-Government within the British Empire, instead of being beneficial, might actually prove injurious. The second amendment necessary is that the methods for the attainment of Swaraj should be amplified. In the place "peaceful" and "legitimate" means "possible" and "proper" should be permitted. Thus, on the one hand, the opportunity of joining the League will be given to those who do not honestly believe Non-Co-operation alone as the sole path of salvation, recognising the possibility of other methods and adopting them also. On the other hand, the amendment will remove the complaint of those who believe the Non-Co-operation can under no circumstances, remain peaceful to the last, and while subscribing to the creed of the Congress and the first clause of
U|| the section dealing with the object of the League as a matter of policy and expediency, refuse to admit it as a faith for all times and circumstances or to remain non-violent even in intention.
U||Gentlemen, there are only two possible means of replacing one Government by another one, the destruction of the Government by sword and the establishment of another in its place, a method which has been followed in the world thus far. The second alternative is to sever all connection with the present Government, and to set up a better or organised Government: parallel to it and improve and develop it till the old order is dissolved and the new takes its place. Friends, to achieve this object, we must immediately set upon a separate and permanent foundation our courts, schools, arts, industries, army, police and a national parliament. Non-violent Non-Co-operation can only help to paralyse the Government, but cannot maintain it. The question now is, can such a parallel Government be established only through non-violent non-co-operation of course, provided the rival Government {200} does not interfere with its establishment, a condition which is obviously impossible. The rival Government will certainly interfer
U||e. We might contend that we will proceed on with our work silently and quietly and in spite of governmental interference as is being done at present. A stage will, however, be reached ultimately when action on peaceful lines will absolutely become impossible, and then we will be forced to admit that a parallel Government can be started, but not continue to the last through peaceful means.
U||Governmental Policy
U||The example of Governmental repression is before your eyes. First, it attempted through Karachi trials to prevent the Musalmans from openly proclaiming the articles of their faith, when the people, undaunted by this decision of the Government, preached through the length and breadth of India that it was unlawful to serve in the army. The Government slowly overlooked those activities fearing lest a mere repetition of the Karachi resolution might lead to disaffection in the Army, and in order to divert the attention of the people from those activities, it suddenly, but deliberately declared the enrollment as unlawful. That might get an opportunity of striking at the Non-Co-operators. Like the moths that gather to sacrifice their lives round lighted candle, the advocates of civil disobedience swarmed to break this declaration of Lord Reading and cheerfully went in their thousands to gaol. This is undoubtedly an example of self-sacrifice and self-effacement which will rightly move Mahatma Gandhi to ecstasy, but 
U||we detect another truth hidden in this demonstration of happiness and joy. It reveals to our eyes the last stage of both the repression of the Government and the patience of the people. The people are, no doubt, prepared to bear and suffer gladly the hardships of a few days of imprisonment but on the declaration of Martial Law the non-violent Non-Co-operation movement will prove totally insufficient and useless. Amongst the Musalmans, at least there will hardly be found a man who will be prepared to sacrifice his life uselessly. A man can only have one of the two feelings in his heart, when faced by the barrel of a gun, either to seek refuge in flight or to take advantage of the {201} law of self-preservation and despatch adversary to hell. The third alternative of cheerfully yielding up one's life to the enemy and considering it to be the one real success will remain confined to Mahatma Gandhi and some of his adherents and fellow thinkers. I, on my part, fear that in general the reply to the Martial Law wil
U||l be what is commonly called guerilla warfare, or in the words of the Quran "kill them wherever you find them." The responsibility lies with the representatives of the Musalmans. The members of the All-India Muslim League, should consider it their duty either to refrain from adopting Non-Co-operation as their creed or free it from the limitation of keeping it, either by violence or non-violence, for it is not in our power to keep Non-Co-operation peaceful or otherwise. So long as the Government confines to the use of chains and fetters, Non-Co-operation can remain peaceful as it is to-day, but if things go further and the Government has recourse to gallows or machine guns it will be impossible for the movement to remain non-violent.
U||Duty of Muslims
U||At this stage, some people would like to ask how is it that, while the Hindus are content to adopt non-violent non-co-operation as the means for attaining independence, that the Musalmans are anxious to go a step further. The answer is that the liberation of Hindustan is as much a political duty of Musalmans as that of a Hindu. Owing to the question of Khilafat it has become a Musalman's religious duty also.
U||In this connection I should like to say just one word. The glories of Ghazhi Mustapha Kemal Pasha and the conclusion of the recent Franco-Turkish Treaty might create an idea in some people's minds that the evacuation of Smyrna by the Greeks is certain, and the restoration of Thrace to the Turks if not certain is within the bounds of possibility. Consequently they might entertain the hope that the struggle in the Near East is coming to a close. I want to warn all such people that the claims of the Musalmans of India are founded more on religious than political principles. So long as the Jazirat-ul-Arab (including Palestine {202} and Mesopotamia) are not absolutely freed from non-Muslim influence, and so long as the political and military power of the Khilafat is not fully restored the Musalmans of India cannot suspend their activities and efforts.
U||The Muslim Demands
U||The Muslim demands as regards the Khilafat are these:—(1) that in the pursuance of the promise of Mr. Lloyd George, Thrace and Shayrna, along with the city of Smyrna, should remain purely under Turkish control, so that the political status of the Khilafat Musalman, which is essential for the Khilafat should suffer no diminution, (2) all non-Turkish control should be removed from Constantinople, the shores of Marmora and the Dardanelles in order that the Khilafat at Constantinople may not be under non-Muslim control, which is essential for the Khilafat; (3) all naval and military restrictions imposed on the Khilafat should be removed, as otherwise, he would have no power to enforce the orders of the Khilafat; (4) the Jazirat-ul-Arab, including the Hedjaz, Palestine, and Mesopotamia, should be free from all non-Muslim influence and not be under the British mandate, as it was the death-bed injunction of the prophet. It should be noted that in the fourth demand we wish the English to give up their mandate of M
U||esopotamia and Palestine and remove their influence from the Hedjaz. As to the question whether the Arabs will acknowledge the Sheriff of Mecca or the Sultan of Turkey as their Khilafat, or whether the Arab Government of Hedjaz, Mesopotamia and Palestine will be independant or under the suzerainty of the Khilafat, they will be decided by the Musalmans. We do not want non-Muslim advice and assistance.
U||A Compact Between Congress and League
U||In my opinion, gentlemen, the most pressing necessity of Hindustan is the immediate conclusion of a definite compact between the Congress and the League. The Congress should not enter into any negotiations with the Government concerning Swaraj (1) until the minimum Muslim demands with regard the Khilafat are satisfied; (2) on the other hand, the Muslim {203} should definitely bind themselves that even though their demands with regard to the Khilafat are satisfied, they, the Musalmans of India, will stand to the last by the side of their Hindu brethren for the attainment and preservation of Indian independence. Such a compact is necessary for the work because there are signs of the enemies of Indian independence, and we have to confess with regret that a number of deceitful Indians working with the foreigners are concentrating all their efforts to wreck the Hindu Muslim unity and create distrust and misunderstanding between the two communities. On the one hand, the Musalmans are being enticed by false hopes w
U||ith regard to the Khilafat question. On the other some show toys of political concessions are being prepared as a gift for the Hindus even before the stipulated period of ten years. It is intended that in simplicity, the Musalmans should consider the return of Smyrna, etc, as the satisfaction their Khilafat demands, and slacken their efforts for the attainment of Swaraj, while the Hindus should be misled into believing a further instalment of reforms as the Swaraj itself, or at least, its precursor and begin to consider the Khilafat as an irrelevant question. There can be only one solution for all these problems. Hindus and Musalmans after mutual consultation, should have Indian independence declared by Mahatma Gandhi, and that in future neither the English might have an opportunity of deceiving nor India of being deceived. After the declaration of independence, the Congress and the League will have only one object left; that is preservation of Swaraj. The 1st January, 1922, is the best date for the purpose 
U||because we would thus have fulfilled the promise that we made to attain Swaraj within this year, and the people of India will achieve success in the eyes of God and man.

U||APPENDIX XIX
U||GOVERNMENT REPLIES.
U||Mr. Gandhi's Misstatements.
U||"Mass civil disobedience is fraught with such danger to the State that it must be met with sternness and severity."
U||So says the Government of India (Home Department) in the communique published below in reply to Mr. Gandhi's manifesto offering a postponement of civil disobedience on certain conditions which Government regard as impossible.
U||The Government statement makes it clear that the issue is between lawlessness and the maintenance of civilised government.
U||The manifesto issued by Mr. Gandhi on the 4th February justifying his determination to resort to mass civil disobedience contains a series of misstatements. Some of these are so important that the Government of India cannot allow them to pass unchallenged. In the first place they emphatically repudiate the statement that they have embarked on a policy of lawless repression and also the suggestion that the present campaign of civil disobedience has been forced on the non-co-operation party, in order to secure the elementary rights of free association, free speech and of a free press. The Government of India desire to draw attention to the fact that the decision to adopt a programme of civil disobedience was finally accepted on the 4th November, before the recent notification relating either to the Seditious Meetings Act or the Criminal Law Amendment Act, to which Mr. Gandhi unmistakeably refers were issued. It was in consequence of serious acts of lawlessness, committed by persons who professed to be follower
U||s of Mr. Gandhi and the non-co-operation movement, that the Government were forced to take measures, which are in strict accordance with the law for the protection of peaceful citizens in the pursuit of their lawful avocations.
U||{205}
U||A new and dangerous situation
U||Since the inauguration of the non-co-operation movement the Government of India actuated by a desire to avoid anything in the nature of the repression of political activity, even though it was of an extreme character, have restricted their action in relation thereto to such measures as were necessary for the maintenance of law and order and the preservation of public tranquility. Up to November no steps, save in Delhi last year, were taken against the volunteer associations. In November, however, the Government were confronted with a new and dangerous situation. In the course of the past year, there had been systematic attempts to tamper with the loyalty of the soldiers and the police, and there had occurred numerous outbreaks of serious disorders, directly attributable to the propaganda of the non-co-operation party amongst the ignorant and excitable masses. These outbreaks had resulted in grave loss of life, the growth of a dangerous spirit of lawlessness, and increasing disregard for lawful authority. In 
U||November they culminated in the grave riots in Bombay, in which 53 persons lost their lives and approximately 400 were wounded. On the same date dangerous manifestations of lawlessness occurred in many other places, and at this period it became clear that many of the volunteer associations had embarked on a systematic campaign of violence, intimidation and obstruction, to combat which proceedings under the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal procedure had proved ineffective.
U||More drastic Measures
U||In these circumstances the Government were reluctantly compelled to resort to measures of a more comprehensive and drastic character. Nevertheless, the operation of the Seditious Meetings Act was strictly limited to a few districts in which the risk of grave disturbance of the peace was specially great, and the application of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1908 was confined to associations, the majority of the members of which had habitually indulged in violence and intimidation. It is impossible here to set out in detail the evidence which justified the adoption {206} of these measures in the different provinces. Abundant proof is, however, to be found in the published proceedings of the various legislative bodies, in the Communiques of the different local Governments, and in the pronouncements of the heads of the provinces. While resolute in their determination to enforce respect for law and order and to protect loyal and peaceful subjects of the Crown, the Government have at the same time taken every p
U||recaution possible to mitigate where desirable the conditions of imprisonment and to avoid any action which might have the appearance of vindictive severity. Ample proof of this will be found in the orders issued by the local Governments. Numerous offenders have been released, sentences have been reduced and special consideration has been shown in the case of persons convicted of offences under the Seditious Meeting's Act or the Criminal Law Amendment Act. There is thus no shadow of justification for the charge that their policy has been one of indiscriminate and lawless repression.
U||A statement disproved
U||A further charge, which has been brought to Mr. Gandhi is that the recent measures of Government have involved a departure from the civilised policy laid down by His Excellency at the time of the apology of the Ali brothers, namely, that the Government of India should not interfere with the activities of the non-co-operators so long as they remained non-violent in word and deed. The following citation from the communique of Government of India issued on the 30th May, conclusively disproves this statement:—
U||"After explaining that in view of the solemn undertaking contained in the statement over their signature it had been decided to refrain from instituting criminal proceedings against Messrs. Mahammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, the Government of India observed, it must not be inferred from the original determination of the Government to prosecute for speeches inciting to violence that promoting disaffection of a less violent character is not an offence against the law. The Government of India desire to make it plain that they will enforce the law relating to offences against the {207} State, as and when they may think fit against any persons who have committed breaches of it."
U||The proposed conference
U||It remains for the Government of India to deal with the allegation that His Excellency summarily rejected the proposal for a conference, although the terms put forward by the conference at Bombay and accepted by the Working Committee of the Congress were quite in keeping with His Excellency's own requirements as indicated in his speech at Calcutta. How far this is from being the case will manifest from a comparison of his Excellency's speech with the terms proposed by the conference. His Excellency in that speech insisted on the imperative necessity, as a fundamental condition precedent to the discussion of any question of a conference of the discontinuance, of the unlawful activities of the non-co-operation party. No assurance on this point, was, however contained in proposals advanced by the conference. On the contrary, whilst the Government were asked to make concessions which not only included the withdrawal of the notifications under the Criminal Law Amendment and Seditious Meetings Acts and the release
U|| of persons convicted thereunder but also this release of persons convicted of offences designed to affect the loyalty of the army; and the submission to an arbitration committee of the cases of other persons convicted under the ordinary law of the land, there was no suggestion that any of the illegal activities of the non-co-operators other than hartals, picquetting and civil disobedience should cease. Moreover, it was evident from the statements made by Mr. Gandhi at the conference, that he intended to continue the enrolment of volunteers in prohibital associations and preparations for civil disobedience. Further, Mr. Gandhi made also it is apparent that the proposed round table conference would be called merely to register his decrees. It is idle to suggest that terms of this character fulfilled in any way the essentials laid down by His Excellency or can reasonably be described as having been made in response to the sentiments expressed by him.
U||{208}
U||Impossible Requests.
U||Finally, the Government of India desire to draw attention to the demands put forward in the concluding para of Mr. Gandhi's present manifesto, which exceeded even the demands made by the Working Committee of the Congress. Mr. Gandhi's demands now include: (1) the release of all prisoners convicted or under trial for non-violent activities; (2) a guarantee that Government will refrain absolutely from interference with all non-violent activities of the non-co-operation party, even though they fall within the purview of the Indian Penal Code, or in other words an undertaking that Government will indefinitely hold in abeyance in regard to the non-co-operators the ordinary and long established law of the land. In return for these concessions he indicated that he intends to continue the illegal and seditious propaganda and operation of the non-co-operation party and merely appears to postpone civil disobedience of an aggressive character until the offenders now in jail have had an opportunity of reviewing the whol
U||e situation. In the same paragraph he re-affirms the unalterable character of the demands of his party. The Government of India are confident that all right thinking citizens will recognise that this manifesto constitutes no response whatever to the speech of His Excellency at Calcutta and that the demands made are such as no Government could discuss, much less accept.
U||Issue—Law versus lawlessness
U||The alternatives that now confront the people of India are such as sophistry can no longer obscure or disguise. The issue is no longer between this or that programme of political advance, but between lawlessness with all its dangerous consequences on the one hand, and on the other the maintenance of those principles which lie at the root of all civilised Government. Mass civil disobedience is fraught with such danger to the State, that it must be met with sternness and severity. The Government entertain no doubt that in any measures which they may have to take for its suppression, they can count on the support and assistance of all law-abiding and loyal citizens of His Majesty.

U||APPENDIX XX
U||N.C.O. RESOLUTION
U||Ahmedabad, December 28.
U||The following was put by Mahatma Gandhi. "Whereas since the holding of the last National Congress, the people of India have found from actual experience that by reason of the adoption of non-violent non-co-operation the country has made great advance in fearlessness, self-sacrifice and self-respect, and whereas the movement has greatly damaged the prestige of the Government, and, whereas, on the whole the country is rapidly progressing towards Swaraj, this Congress confirms the resolution adopted at the Special session of the Congress at Calcutta and reaffirmed at Nagpur, and places on record the fixed determination of the Congress to continue the programme of non-violent non-co-operation with greater vigour than hitherto, in such manner as each province may determine, till the Punjab and the Khilafat wrongs are redressed and Swaraj is established, and the control of the Government of India passed into the hands of the people, from that of an irresponsible corporation, and whereas the reason of the threat ut
U||tered by his Excellency the Viceroy in recent speeches and the consequent repression started by the Government of India, in the provinces by way of disbandment of Volunteer corps and forcible prohibition of public and even committee meetings in an illegal and high handed manner, and by the arrests of many Congress workers in several provinces, and whereas this repression is manifestly intended to stifle all Congress and Khilafat activities and deprive the public of their assistance, this Congress resolves that all activities of the Congress be suspended, as far as necessary, and appeals to all quietly and without any demonstration to offer themselves for arrest by belonging to the Volunteer organisations to be formed throughout the country in terms of the resolution of the Working Committee, arrived at in Bombay, on the 23rd day of November last, provided that no one shall be accepted as Volunteer who does not sign the following pledge:—
U||{210}
U||The Pledge
U||"With God as witness, I solemnly declare that (1) I wish to be a member of the National Volunteer Corps; (2) So long as I remain a member of the Corps, I shall remain non-violent in word and deed, and shall earnestly endeavour to be non-violent in intent, since I believe that as India is circumstanced non-violence can help the Khilafat and the Punjab and result in the attainment of Swaraj and consolidation of unity among all the races and communities of India, whether Hindu, Mussalman, Sikh, Parsi Christian or Jew; (3) I believe in and shall endeavour always to promote such unity; (4) I believe in Swadeshi as essential for India's economic, political and moral salvation, and shall use handspun and hand-woven Khaddar to the exclusion of every other cloth; (5) as a Hindu, I believe in the justice and necessity of removing the evil of untouchability and shall on all possible occasions seek personal contact with, and endeavour to render service to, the submerged classes; (6) I shall carry out the instructions of
U|| my superior officers and all the regulations not inconsistent with the spirit of this pledge prescribed by the Volunteer Boards or the Working Committee or any other agency established by the Congress; (7) I am prepared to suffer imprisonment, assault, or even death for the sake of my religion, and my country, without resentment; (8) in the event of my imprisonment, I shall not claim from the Congress any support for my family or dependants.
U||Volunteer corps
U||"This Congress trusts that every person of the age of 18 and over will immediately join the Volunteer organisations. Notwithstanding the proclamation prohibiting public meetings, and inasmuch as even Committee meetings have been attempted to be construed as public meetings, this Congress advises the holding of Committee meeting in enclosed places and by tickets and by previous announcements, at which as far as possible only speakers previously announced shall deliver written speeches, care being {211} taken, in every case, to avoid the risk of provocation and possible violence by the public in consequence.
U||"This Congress is further of opinion that Civil Disobedience is the only civilized and effective substitute for an armed rebellion, whenever every other remedy for preventing arbitrary, tyrannical and emasculating use of authority by individuals or corporations, has been tried and, therefore, advises all Congress workers and others who believe in peaceful methods and are convinced that there is no remedy save some kind of sacrifice to dislodge the existing Government from its position of perfect irresponsibility to the people of India, to organise individual Civil Disobedience, and massed, when the mass of people have been sufficiently trained in the methods of non-violence, and otherwise in terms of the resolution therein of the last meeting of the All-India Congress Committee held at Delhi, this Congress is of opinion that in order to concentrate its attention upon Civil Disobedience, whether mass or individual (whether of an offensive or defensive character) under proper safeguards, and under instructions
U|| to be issued from time to time by the Working Committee or Provincial Congress Committee concerned, all other Congress activities should be suspended whenever and wherever, and to the extent to which it may be found necessary.
U||Mahatma the dictator
U||"This Congress calls upon all students of the age of 18 and over, particularly those studying in the national institutions and the staff thereof, immediately to sign the foregoing pledge and become members of National Volunteer Corps.
U||"In view of the impending arrest of a large number of Congress workers, this Congress, whilst requiring the ordinary machinery to remain intact and to be utilised in the ordinary manner whenever feasible, hereby appoints until further instructions Mahatma Gandhi as the sole Executive authority of the Congress and invests him with the full powers of the All-India Congress Committee including the power to convene a special session of the Congress or of the All-India Congress Committee {212} or the Working Committee, and also with power to appoint a successor in emergency.
U||"This Congress hereby confers upon the said successor and all subsequent successors appointed in turn by their predecessors, all this aforesaid power provided that nothing in this resolution shall be deemed to authorise Mahatma Gandhi or any of the aforesaid successors to conclude any terms of peace with the Government of India or the British Government without the previous sanction of the All-India Congress Committee to be finally ratified by the Congress specially convened for the purpose, (and provided also that the present Creed of the Congress shall in no case be altered by Mahatma Gandhi or his successors except with the leave of the Congress first obtained).
U||"This Congress congratulates all those patriots who are now undergoing imprisonment for the sake of their conscience or country, and realises that their sacrifice has considerably hastened the advent of Swaraj."
U||APPENDIX XXI
U||Mr. M. K. Gandhi's Statement
U||Before reading his written statement Mr. Gandhi spoke a few words as introductory remarks to the whole statement. He said: Before I read this statement, I would like to state that I entirely endorse the learned Advocate-General's remarks in connection with my humble self. I think that he was entirely fair to me in all the statements that he has made, because it is very true and I have no desire whatsoever to conceal from this Court the fact that to preach disaffection towards the existing system of Government has become almost a passion with me. And the learned Advocate-General is also entirely in the right when he says that my preaching of disaffection did not commence with my connection with "Young India" but that it commenced much earlier and in the statement that I am about to read it will be my painful duty to admit before this Court that it commenced much earlier than the {213} period stated by the Advocate-General. It is the most painful duty with me but I have to discharge that duty knowing the respo
U||nsibility that rested upon my shoulders.
U||And I wish to endorse all the blame that the Advocate-General has thrown on my shoulders in connection with the Bombay occurrence, Madras occurrences, and the Chouri Choura occurrences thinking over these things deeply, and sleeping over them night after night and examining my heart I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible for me to dissociate myself from the diabolical crimes of Chouri Choura or the mad outrages of Bombay. He is quite right when he says that as a man of responsibility, a man having received a fair share of education, having had a fair share of experience of this world, I should know the consequences of every one of my acts. I knew them. I knew that I was playing with fire. I ran the risk and if I was set free I would still do the same. I would be failing in my duty if I do not do so. I have felt it this morning that I would have failed in my duty if I did not say all what I said here just now. I wanted to avoid violence. Non-violence is the first article of my faith. It is the la
U||st article of my faith. But I had to make my choice. I had either to submit to a system which I considered has done an irreparable harm to my country or incur the risk of the mad fury of my people bursting forth when they understood the truth from my lips. I know that my people have sometimes gone mad. I am deeply sorry for it; and I am, therefore, here to submit not to a light penalty but to the highest penalty. I do not ask for mercy. I do not plead any extenuating act. I am here, therefore, to invite and submit to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen. The only course open to you, Mr. Judge, is, as I am just going to say in my statement, either to resign your post or inflict on me the severest penalty if you believe that the system and law you are assisting to administer are good for the people. I do not expect that kind of conversion. But by the time I have finished with my statement you will, per
U||haps, have {214} a glimpse of what is raging within my breast to run this maddest risk which a sane man can run.
U||WRITTEN STATEMENT
U||I owe it perhaps to the Indian public and to the public in England to placate which this prosecution is mainly taken up that I should explain why from a staunch loyalist and co-operator I have become an uncompromising disaffectionist and non-co-operator. To the court too I should say why I plead guilty to the charge of promoting disaffection towards the Government established by law in India.
U||My public life began in 1893 in South Africa in troubled weather. My first contact with British authority in that country was not of a happy character. I discovered that as a man and an Indian I had no rights. On the contrary I discovered that I had no rights as a man because I was an Indian.
U||But I was not baffled. I thought that this treatment of Indians was an excrescence upon a system that was intrinsically and mainly good. I gave the Government my voluntary and hearty co-operation, criticising it fully where I felt it was faulty but never wishing its destruction.
U||Consequently when the existence of the Empire was threatened in 1899 by the Boer challenge, I offered my services to it, raised a volunteer ambulance corps and served at several actions that took place for the relief of Ladysmith. Similarly in 1906 at the time of the Zulu revolt I raised a stretcher-bearer party and served till the end of the 'rebellion'. On both these occasions I received medals and was even mentioned in despatches. For my work in South Africa I was given by Lord Hardinge a Kaiser-i-Hind Gold Medal. When the war broke out in 1914 between England and Germany I raised a volunteer ambulance corps in London consisting of the then resident Indians in London, chiefly students. Its work was acknowledged by the authorities to be valuable. Lastly in India when a special appeal was made at the War Conference in Delhi in 1917 by Lord Chelmsford for recruits, I struggled at the cost of my health to raise a corps in {215} Kheda and the response was being made when the hostilities ceased and orders were 
U||received that no more recruits were wanted. In all these efforts at service I was actuated by the belief that was possible by such services to gain a status of full equality in the Empire for my countrymen.
U||The first shock came in the shape of the Rowlatt Act a law designed to rob the people of all real freedom. I felt called upon to lead an intensive agitation against it. Then followed the Punjab horrors beginning with the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh and culminating in crawling orders, public floggings and other indescribable humiliations. I discovered too that the plighted word of the Prime Minister to the Mussulmans of India regarding the integrity of Turkey and the holy places of Islam was not likely to be fulfilled. But in spite of the foreboding and the grave warnings of friends, at the Amritsar Congress in 1919 I fought for co-operation and working the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, hoping that the Prime Minister would redeem his promise to the Indian Mussulmans, that the Punjab wound would be healed and that the reforms inadequate and unsatisfactory though they were, marked a new era of hope in the life of India.
U||But all that hope was shattered. The Khilafat promise was not to be redeemed. The Punjab crime was white-washed and most culprits went not only unpunished but remained in service and some continued to draw pensions from the Indian revenue, and in some cases were rewarded. I saw too that not only did the reforms not mark a change of heart, but they were only a method of further draining India of her wealth and of prolonging her servitude.
U||I came reluctantly to the conclusion that the British connection had made India more helpless than she ever was before, politically and economically. A disarmed India has no power of resistance against any aggressor if she wanted to engage in an armed conflict with him. So much is this the case that some of our best men consider that India must take generations before she can achieve the Dominion status. She has become so poor that she has little power of resisting famines. Before the British advent India spun {216} and wove in her millions of cottages just the supplement she needed for adding to her meagre agricultural resources. The cottage industry, so vital for India's existence, has been ruined by incredibly heartless and inhuman processes as described by English witnesses. Little do town-dwellers know how the semi-starved masses of Indians are slowly sinking to lifelessness. Little do they know that their miserable comfort represents the brokerage they get for the work they do for the foreign exploiter
U||, that the profits and the brokerage are sucked from the masses. Little do they realise that the Government established by law in British India is carried on for this exploitation of the masses. No sophistry, no jugglery in figures can explain away the evidence the skeletons in many villages present to the naked eye. I have no doubt whatsoever that both England and the town-dwellers of India will have to answer, if there is a God above, for this crime against humanity which is perhaps unequalled in history. The law itself in this country has been used to serve the foreign exploiter. My unbiased examination of the Punjab Martial Law cases has led me to believe that at least ninety-five per cent of convictions were wholly bad. My experience of political cases in India leads me to the conclusion that in nine out of every ten the condemned men were totally innocent. Their crime consisted in love of their country. In ninety-nine cases out of hundred justice has been denied to Indians as against Europeans in the C
U||ourt of India. This is not an exaggerated picture. It is the experience of almost every Indian who has had anything to do with such cases. In my opinion the administration of the law is thus prostituted consciously or unconsciously for the benefit of the exploiter.
U||The greatest misfortune is that Englishmen and their Indian associates in the administration of the country do not know that they are engaged in the crime I have attempted to describe. I am satisfied that many English and Indian officials honestly believe that they are administering one of the best systems devised in the world and that India is making steady though slow progress. They do not know that a subtle but effective system of terrorism and an organised display of force on the one hand and the deprivation of {217} all powers of retaliation or self-defence on the other have emasculated the people and induced in them the habit of simulation. This awful habit has added to the ignorance and the self-deception of the administrators. Section 124-A under which I am happily charged is perhaps the prince among the political sections of the Indian Penal Code designed to suppress the liberty of the citizen. Affection cannot be manufactured or regulated by law. If one has no affection for a person or thing one sh
U||ould be free to give the fullest expression to his disaffection so long as he does not contemplate, promote or incite to violence. But the section under which Mr. Banker and I are charged is one under which mere promotion of disaffection is a crime. I have studied some of the cases tried under it, and I know that some of the most loved of India's patriots have been convicted under it. I consider it a privilege therefore, to be charged under it. I have endeavoured to give in their briefest outline the reasons for my disaffection. I have no personal ill-will against any single administrator, much less can I have any disaffection towards the King's person. But I hold it to be a virtue to be disaffected towards a Government which in its totality has done more harm to India than any previous system. India is less manly under the British rule than she ever was before. Holding such a belief, I consider it to be a sin to have affection for the system. And it has been a precious privilege for me to be able to write w
U||hat I have in the various articles tendered in evidence against me.
U||In fact I believe that I have rendered a service to India and England by showing in non-co-operation the way out of the unnatural state in which both are living. In my humble opinion, non-co-operation with evil is as much a duty as is co-operation with good. But in the past, non-co-operation has been deliberately expressed in violence to the evildoer. I am endeavouring to show to my countrymen that violent non-co-operation only multiplies evil and that as evil can only be sustained by violence, withdrawal of support of evil requires complete abstention from violence. Non-violence implies voluntary submission to the penalty for non-co-operation with evil. I am here, therefore, to invite and submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen. The only course open to you, the Judge and the Assessors, is either to resign your posts and thus dissociate yourselves from evil if you feel that the law 
U||you are called upon to administer is an evil and that in reality I am innocent, or to inflict on me the severest penalty if you believe that the system and the law you are assisting to administer are good for the people of this country and that my activity is therefore injurious to the public weal.

Later the villagers again attacked the police and one villager cut a head constable with a dah on the fore-arm and attempted to seize his carbine. Another head constable came to the rescue and in the scuffle the carbine went off and the original assailant was shot in the abdomen. As villagers continued to attack, a head constable fired twice into the crowd. The police then made good their escape.
U|| 
U||One villager killed, two severely wounded, seven slightly wounded; one head constable cut on forearm, one head constable incised wound on head, two constables slight cuts about arms and several hit by missiles.

U||Sirajgung. 	A sub-inspector and 3 constables attempted to arrest three volunteers who were picketing some liquor shops. A crowd gathered and succeeded in separating and beating the constables. The sub-inspector fled. The {246} mob then went in search of the excise sub-inspector and having failed to find him, they looted the ganja and liquor shop. In the course of this incident one rifle was lost by the police.
U|| 
U||Several instances of vigorous picketing occurred in this neighbourhood through which the D.M. and Superintendent of Police decided to have a route march. They arrived at Salangahat with two head constables and 23 constables of armed police. A number of volunteers had collected here and as the Deputy Magistrate received complaints of interference several were arrested. A crowd of about 2,000 then gathered and pelted the police. Every effort was made to disperse the crowd. Eventually after the Deputy Superintendent of Police had been hit with a lathi the Magistrate ordered fire to be opened first with buckshot, and when this proved unavailing, with ball. The crowd then dispersed leaving 4 dead and 6 wounded.

Two arrests were made which resulted in the collection of a threatening crowd who hemmed in the police against the wall of the mill. After failing to get in touch with the Sub Divisional Magistrate over the telephone the Deputy Superintendent ordered first one and then several of his men to fire. One man was killed and another died subsequently. Altogether 40 were reported to have been wounded, seven were sent to hospital.

U||Chauri Chaura. 	An attempt to picket Muderwa bazar and prevent sales of fish, drugs and liquor had been frustrated by police. Also an Ahir (gowli caste) Government pensioner, who was a previous convict and had become volunteer, was called up and threatened with loss of his pension. The volunteers, determined on Saturday, that is the next bazar day, {248} to forcibly picket the bazar and overawe all opposition by their numbers. The owner of the bazar is a loyal zaminder. The volunteers proceeded to the bazar through the police station grounds. They attacked the police station with kunkars and bricks. Eventually the police fired in the air. The attack was renewed with greater force. The mob rushed the police and they fled, some into the fields and some into the buildings. A few police must have fired on the mob in earnest, but it cannot be said whether it was before the rush or not. Buildings were set on fire and all the force there except one constable and one chaukidar, who escaped were brutally beaten to de
U||ath and then burnt. Also a little boy servant of the Sub Inspector was murdered. Resistance to the mob was, I fear, badly organised. Then the mob tore up two rails on the line, cut telegraph wires and scattered.

U||APPENDIX XXIII
U||The Honourable Sir William Vincent's Speech at the Legislative Assembly, 18th January 1922
U||I say, Sir, from that time we have always avoided systematically and steadily any excessive severity vis a vis this movement. Later, there were a number of seditious speeches, including incitements to violence, particularly by Mr. Muhammad Ali and his brother, and Government were prepared to take action against them. What ensued is well known to the Members of this Assembly. There were meetings between Mr. Gandhi and His Excellency, and later Muhammad Ali and his brother offered to the public certain undertakings on which the Government withdrew the prosecutions against them. In a letter of June, 1921, addressed to Local Governments after this undertaking we indeed expressed some hope that it might be possible to reduce the number of prosecutions. We were anxious not to force the pace and although we always maintained our determination to keep order, we sought to avoid over-drastic action against the less dangerous or less violent adherents of the movement. At the same time we indicated to Local Governments 
U||that they were not to prosecute persons, the prosecution of whom might have great effect outside the province, without consulting the Government of India. In that letter, further, we invited Local Governments to give certain other convicted persons the same locus poenitentiae which had been given to Muhammad Ali and his brother. We have throughout avoided very carefully any suggestion, any action which might create the impression that we desire to interfere with a legitimate political movement. I defy any Member of this Assembly to say otherwise. We have indeed frequently been reproached with weakness on this account. I maintain that it was not weakness but patience. At the same time, we made every effort to meet the legitimate wishes of educated opinion in this country. I have no time to-day to recapitulate all we have done but I should like to mention such {253} matters as the compensation to persons injured in the Punjab disorders, the further review of the Punjab sentences, the Committee on the Press Act
U||, the results of which will be before this Assembly very shortly; again, the Committee on repressive measures and the Committee to inquire into racial distinctions in criminal proceedings. In fact, there was no question that came before us in which we did not honestly seek to meet moderate Members of the Assembly in order to consolidate the moderate party into a great working power in the country for good. What has been response of Mr. Gandhi and his followers? I maintain that it has been one steady stream of sedition, one steady attempt to subvert Government, one method of promoting this object being adopted after another. Sometimes it has been the boycott of piece goods in order to injure British trade, although Mr. Gandhi had himself I believe, at one time said that 'boycott' was a word that was entirely inconsistent with his principle of 'Ahimsa'. Later this movement took the form of attempts on the loyalty of our troops attempts on the police and there were constant incitements to disorder. These have r
U||esulted in serious outbreaks of violence in many parts of the country, the most important of which was the Moplah outbreak. Sir, there has recently been some attempt to minimise the cruelties committed by the Moplahs in Malabar. I refer in particular to the remarks of Mr. Abdul Bari and Mr. Husrat Mohani on this subject. Mr. Abdul Bari spoke of the pure spirit of the Moplahs and denied the veracity of the accounts of their atrocities. Mr. Husrat Mohani justifies them in the following words:
U||"At such a critical juncture when they are engaged in war against the English, their Hindu neighbours not only do not help them or observe neutrality but aid and assist the English in every possible way. They can indeed contend that, while they are fighting a defensive war for the sake of their religion and have left their houses, property and belongings, and taken refuge in the hills and jungles, it is unfair to characterise as plunder their commandeering of money, provisions and other necessities for their troops from the English and their supporters."
U||{254} Many of us, however, have, I believe, some knowledge of the atrocities committed by these men, atrocities which I am certain in my mind that every Mussalman in this House deplores as deeply as I do, and they will appreciate what a misrepresentation of the facts this is. The barbarities of the Moplahs have been indefensible. I will cite one instance 'New India' in support of what I say. Writing of a respectable Nair, an article in this paper states:
U||'When on the 26th he threatened other steps, the rebels forced their way into his house, dragged him out, along with his wife and two children carried them to the mosque and bathed all four and compelled them to recite verses from the Koran and dress as Moplahs. At mid-night they were led home and imprisoned. Next day the deponent's head was shaved and ten days later a certain notorious criminal (now in custody) forcibly circumcised the deponent. Three weeks later he and his family and other converts (some being Christians) escaped to Shoranur.'
U||Sir, I am one of those who have been to Malabar, I have seen myself refugees, a thousand in one refuge, hungry, homeless, lacking clothes, and I can assure Members of this Assembly that it was a pitiable sight to see. I only mention the facts because this attempt has been made and because this rising, these acts of cruelty and murder are one of the direct results of the Khilafat movement. I do not put it (I never have put it) that Mr. Gandhi is responsible for this directly, but I do say that his supporters—his Muhammadan supporters—were the cause of this terrible loss of life. Indeed you have only got to read, Mr. Hasrat Mohani's speech to see what the character of the rising was. Now, if the Moplah outbreak had been an isolated instance of disorder, as I said in the last Session, the Government might not have been forced to take action against this non-co-operation movement. It might well have been argued that the circumstances were exceptional. But have Members of this Assembly read the report which i
U||s attached to the Repressive Measures Committee? Have they read the appendix setting out a list of 34 outbreaks of disorders of a serious character within a year? Sir, we have been told that after the declaration of policy {255} by this Government in March last, the non-co-operation movement was dying down. I think that I am correct in making this statement; and I hope I am not misrepresenting anybody. Is there any foundation for it? Does not every Member of this Assembly know that that is absolutely inaccurate? Does not every Member here know that the movement of disloyalty to the Crown, intended to paralyse Government, intended to subvert the administration, has been growing day by day throughout the year? Can any man here say that actually the movement was losing strength? Do not these disorders tell a different story—these outbreaks which culminated in the riots in Bombay on the 17th November? Before I come to that however, I want to deal with another point. May I inform this Assembly that, during the 
U||present year, it has been necessary to call out the military to suppress serious disorder no less than 47 times? May I tell them that, during the last three months, military assistance has had to be invoked—I have here the figures from His Excellency the Commander in-Chief—no less than 19 times? Does that look as if the forces of disorder were losing strength before the Government took this action?
U||And now, Sir, I want to turn to the rioting in Bombay in which the lawless tendencies of those who follow Mr. Gandhi—not of Mr. Gandhi himself—culminated. Bombay is a city in which Mr. Gandhi is supposed to exercise the greatest influence. He himself was present there on the 17th November. The occasion was one, one would have thought, when at least every loyal citizen of the Crown, whatever his political views, would have avoided any disorder or riot. It was the occasion of the landing of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, the heir to the Throne of England. That was the occasion chosen by the non-co-operators in Bombay for an outbreak of violence which, I believe, has not been paralleled in that city for many many years, and what was the object of those who embarked upon this campaign of violence? I say the object was vengeance, vengeance on those who dared to go forth to welcome His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in spite of Mr. Gandhi's direction—that was the sole crime of the unfortunate pe
U||ople so maltreated. That Sir, is the result of non-violent {256} non-co-operation. Was Mr. Gandhi able to exercise any influence to stop the demand? Why, it was pathetic to read his words next day. He was full of sorrow, but he had not thought of the consequences of his act before. After all he had warning on previous occasions. Well, Sir, I do not know that I need go through the events of these terrible days. You have heard from my Honourable friend, Mr. Dwaraka Das, how women were assaulted in the public streets; you have read in the papers how harmless Europeans and Indians, including many Parsis, were murdered, or assaulted, how one unfortunate engine driver, going home from his work, a harmless individual, was suddenly attacked and murdered by a cruel mob. All this was the result of this non-violent movement. The reports say that it began in intimidation and that was not checked, those who had been guilty of intimidation thought they could proceed with impunity to violence. The damage done to property a
U||lso—the property of private individuals—was very great. I read in one report, of 137 shops being looted and that is an under statement of all the damage.
U||Now, let us see what was happening in other places on that day? In Delhi there was hartal enforced by systematic threats and intimidation. And I assert here, and I dare any one to contradict me, that intimidation was practised by men posing as volunteers; men dressed as volunteers who paraded the streets and interfered with the liberty of law-abiding citizens in a manner that is intolerable in any civilised community. Is it surprising that we received many complaints actually of absolute want of any Government control at the time? In Calcutta, again there was hartal promoted by general intimidation and violence on the part of volunteers. It is idle for any one to deny it. Mr. Abdul Kasem and other Members were in Calcutta and they know the facts. The Government of Bengal, writing on the 26th November, reported that an incessant stream of seditious speeches was being poured forth, that money was being freely spent in the employment of paid agents; and here I may tell the Assembly that many of these volunteers
U||,—I do not say all of them because that would be wrong,—but {257} many of these volunteers are merely paid men, paid a rupee a day, and, in fact when the supply of money dries up,—and there have been places where this has happened,—the supply of volunteers has run short. We were also told by the Bengal Government that on the 17th there was general suspension of activities of all kinds and the riff-raff of the city, under the guise of volunteers, was abroad, terrorising and abusing law-abiding folk, and there were numerous instances of molestations of Europeans and Indians. The authority of Government was openly flouted; and law abiding citizens were depressed because of Government's failure to protect them, I have got instances here of the different kinds of speeches made in Bengal. I do not think I need cite them except to mention that one of them says:
U||'That the Bengalees had discovered the death-arrow of the English. Remember Kanai and Khudiram Bose and others of Bengal.'
U||I do not suppose the Members of this Assembly know who they were; they were prominent murderers; some, if not all of them, were hanged. Well, Sir, the whole effect of the activities was that, on the 17th of November in Calcutta there was an absolute effacement of the authority of Government, and general intimidation throughout the whole of the city. I am told now that we exaggerated all this: There was a hartal, it is true, but there was nothing more than a voluntary one. Well, the Amrita Bazar Patrika, itself stated on the morning of the 18th a most significant fact—I cite it because it is testimony coming from an adversary—it said on the 18th 'Writ large on the hartal of Calcutta is revolution'. Now I ask the Assembly to ponder those words.
U||I may say that throughout all this period the most desperate efforts were made to create racial animosity. Those who were in Calcutta in December last—I was there—know how true this is and it was a very dangerous factor in the situation. There was also at that time every reason to believe that if the activities of these so-called volunteers were not curtailed, we should have a repetition in Calcutta of what we had {258} in Bombay. Now the total deaths in Bombay were 53 people killed, and I think something like 400 injured went to the Hospital. The problem before the Government, therefore, was: are you going to sit quietly, or, as my Honourable friend said, 'with folded hands' and watch with apathy and inertia this slaughter of innocent people, or are you going to take action while there is yet time? The Assembly remember also that previously, on the 14th of November, there had been already a dangerous riot in Calcutta at Belgatchia, in which over 5,000 people had been engaged. Now, I maintain that, in su
U||ch circumstances, the Bengal Government were fully justified in taking the action. We have abundant testimony that, whatever be the professions of those who inaugurate these volunteer movement, their practice and precept are poles apart. You may say that they enter into a solemn vow of non-violence, but in practice they are repeatedly constantly and persistently, guilty of intimidation and violence. Let me turn to another province. I have got a report here from the Bihar Government. We called for these reports to see on what grounds they had proceeded against these associations. The replies show that Local Governments were satisfied that the members of the proscribed associations went in systematically for this class of offence. To return to Bihar, on the 10th of December, I received a report from the Local Government which says that these volunteers had been guilty of intimidation, violence and other forms of criminal action on no less than 122 occasions reported in the last year. One of the incidents is wo
U||rthy of special mention, indeed many of them are. The one to which I refer was the case of a poor Muhammadan who had the misfortune to be a law-abiding subject of the Crown. He died in Ranchi and his funeral had to be performed. But the non-co-operators said: "No, he shall not be buried by Muhammadans." Well, some over-daruni spirit said: 'Oh, his was not so great an offence that we should allow this oppression; men who differ from other in their political views are entitled to a little toleration.' So they took the body to the graveyard with police protection and buried it. What was the next action of the extremists? The non-co-operation volunteers dug up {259} the corpse and dishonoured it, ('Shame.') Well that is the conduct of these non-violent non-co-operation volunteers. Again, on the 17th in Calcutta, there were unfortunately two Muhammadans who died in Ballygunge of natural causes and those who wished to bury them could not procure the necessary assistance: they were unable to procure bearers or Khat
U||ias or anything else and the bodies remained unburied for the whole of that day. There was many a sick man and woman in Calcutta on the 17th who could not procure medical attendance. No conveyances for medical practitioners, and when doctors walked to the patients and attended on them, they would not get medicine, because the dispensaries were not allowed under the strict orders of the non-co-operators to sell medicine even to save life on that day. Now, is that intimidation or is it not? I have been told that Government interferes with the liberty of the subject in proscribing these associations. I am amazed at the audacity of those who make such an accusation, whether it comes from the Members of this Assembly or from those who are of different political opinions, and I include Mr. Gandhi. Who in reality has interfered with the liberty of the subject to the same extent as members of his party? Who is it that will not allow those who wish to welcome the Prince to do so? Who prevents reasonable respect being
U|| shown to the dead! Who boycots and intimidates those who venture to serve the Crown or wish to sell or buy foreign piece goods? Who will not allow any member of the Assembly to address a public meeting without interruption? ('Hear, hear'.) Who, then, is it that is really guilty of interference with the liberty of the subject? What extremist can make, with justice, this accusation against the Government? What has the Government done in this matter?...
U||And now, Sir, I wish to turn to our instructions of 24th November, in so far as the Criminal Law Amendment Act goes. They were to the effect that where associations practised intimidation violence and obstruction, it was necessary to suppress those activities and that the Act of 1908 should be used for that purpose. I believe, up to a certain point at any rate, it has been successful. What followed? A number of young men—many of them in {260} Calcutta, hired from the mills—joined these associations as volunteers for a money reward. Many are doing it in Delhi now and a rupee a day is the price. They join the volunteers in defiance of all orders and then complain bitterly and pose as patriots, if they are arrested. In Delhi, when the movement first started and arrests took place, the authorities were anxious not to impose too severe penalties on accused and the consequence was, they were sentenced simple imprisonment. Many of them were quite pleased; they were able to get free meals and had nothing to do, 
U||so later it was found necessary to sentence others to rigorous imprisonment. At once there was a general feeling that this was very unfair, though it was really a very natural consequence. Throughout, however, the Government have been very anxious to avoid any appearance of undue severity; to avoid any appearance of unreasonable harshness we have made various suggestions to the Local Governments with which I will deal later. Apart from this, however, His Excellency was never unmindful of the dangers of a purely regressive policy and, as every Honourable Member knows he received a deputation on the 21st December in Calcutta and listened to their views on the action of Government and the possibility of a conference between different sections of the community and Government. And I should like to read to Honourable Members one or two words from His Excellency's reply to that deputation because, to my mind, his words breathe a lofty tone of statesmanship and indicate a deep desire to find a solution of the proble
U||m of all the difficulties with which the Government are faced. He spoke words over which every Member of this Assembly would do well to ponder. Referring to a suggestion that Government should cease making use of measures now enforced and release prisoners convicted under the law, he said:
U||'I cannot believe that this was the intention, of the deputation, when originally suggested, for it would mean that throughout the country intimidation and unlawful oppression and other unlawful acts should be allowed to continue, whilst Government action to maintain order and protect the law-abiding citizen would be largely paralysed. I need scarcely tell you that no responsible Government {261} could even contemplate the acceptance of such a state of public affairs. I wish with all my heart, that it had been possible to deal with these problems in a large and generous spirit, worthy of such on occasion in the history of India. Had there been indications to this effect before me to-day in the representations which you have made in your address on the part of the leaders of non-co-operation, had the offer been made to discontinue open breaches of the law for the purpose of providing a calmer atmosphere for discussion of remedies suggested, my Government would never have been backward in response. We would ha
U||ve been prepared to consider the new situation in the same large and generous spirit I would have conferred with Local Governments for this purpose.'
U||Sir, now what was Mr. Gandhi's reply to this? This is what Mr. Gandhi said:
U||'I am sorry that I suspect Lord Reading of complicity in the plot to unman India.'
U||I would ask Honourable Members of this Assembly if they would take that view. He proceeded to say:
U||"I am forced to conclude that Lord Reading is trying to emasculate India by forcibly making free speech and popular organization impossible."
U||In another article he said:
U||"I was totally unprepared for what I most respectfully call his mischievous misrepresentation of the attitude of the Congress and the Khilafat organisations in connection with the visit of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales."
U||This country is, in truth, faced with a very grave crisis: we have civil disobedience looming before us. We have threats of organised violence from an influential section of the Mussalman population. We have had outbreaks of violence of a dangerous character showing what may happen in a more extended degree in future. We have had the most terrible bloodshed and loss of life. We are face to face with a situation in which there may be, I fear, greater loss of life and greater bloodshed. It is for the Assembly to say whether they are now going to encourage the forces which make for ruin and disorder. It is for them to say {262} whether, consistently with their oath of allegiance to the Crown, most solemnly sworn here, they can conscientiously and deliberately encourage those who intend to overthrow this Government by any means that is possible. Lastly, it is for them to ponder their responsibility not only to the Assembly, not only to the Government and to the country, but also to themselves. It is for them to 
U||say whether they will take such a course as will facilitate a real and very grave danger to their own properties, to their own lives, to their own honour.

U||MOHANDAS KARAMCHAND GANDHI.
U||In connection with the present essay I wish to tender my affectionate thanks to my faithful collaborator, my sister, and to my friend, Kalidas Nag, whose deep knowledge and indefatigable kindness have guided my steps through the forest of Indian thought.
U||I also wish to thank the publisher, S. Ganesan of Madras, for having placed, spontaneously, his publications at my disposal.
U||The literal translation of Mahatma, the name which the people of India gave to Gandhi, is "the great Soul," maha, great; atma, soul. The word goes back to the Upanishads, where it is used in speaking of the Supreme Being, and, through communion of Knowledge and Love, of those who become One with Him:
U||"He is the One Luminous, Creator of All,
U||Mahatma,
U||Always in the hearts of the people enshrined.
U||Revealed through Love, Intuition, and Thought,
U||Whoever knows Him, Immortal becomes...."
U||Tagore, on a visit to Ashram, Gandhi's favorite retreat, quoted this stanza, referring to the Apostle.
U||MAHATMA GANDHI
U||PART ONE
U||§ 1
U||Dark, tranquil eyes. A small frail man, a thin face with large protruding ears. His head covered with a little white cap, his body clothed in coarse white cloth, barefooted. He lives on rice and fruit and drinks only water. He sleeps on the floor—sleeps very little, and works incessantly. His body does not seem to count at all. There is nothing striking about him, at first, except his expression of "great patience and great love." W. W. Pearson, who met him in South Africa in 1918, instinctively thought of St. Francis of Assisi. There is an almost childlike simplicity about him.[1] His manner is gentle and courteous even when dealing with adversaries,[2] and he is of immaculate sincerity.[3] He is modest and unassuming, to the point of sometimes seeming almost timid, hesitant, in making an assertion. Yet you feel his indomitable spirit. He makes no compromises and never tries to hide a mistake. Nor is he afraid to admit having been in the wrong. Diplomacy is unknown to him; he shuns oratorical effect or, r
U||ather, never thinks about it; and he shrinks unconsciously from the great popular demonstrations organized in his honor. Literally "ill with the multitude that adores him,"[4] he distrusts majorities and fears "mobocracy" and the unbridled passions of the populace. He feels at ease only in a minority, and is happiest when, in meditative solitude, he can listen to the "still small voice" within.[5]
U||This is the man who has stirred three hundred million people to revolt, who has shaken the foundations of the British Empire, and who has introduced into human politics the strongest religious impetus of the last two thousand years.
U||§ 2
U||His real name is Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. He was born in a little semi-independent state in the northwestern part of India, at Porbandar, the "White City" on the sea of Oman, October 2, 1868. He comes of an ardent and active race, which to this day has been split by civil strife; a practical race, commercially keen, which established trade relations all the way from Aden to Zanzibar. Gandhi's father and grandfather were both leaders of the people and met with persecution because of their independent spirit. Both were forced to flee for safety, their lives in peril. Gandhi's family was well-to-do and belonged to a cultivated class of society, but it was not of superior caste. His parents were followers of the Jaïn school of Hinduism, which regards ahimsa,[6] the doctrine of non-injury to any form of life, as one of its basic principles. This was the doctrine which Gandhi was to proclaim victoriously throughout the world. The Jaïnists believe that the principle of love, not intelligence, is the road which
U|| leads to God. The Mahatma's father cared little for wealth and material values, and left scarcely any to his family, having given almost everything away to charity. Gandhi's mother was a very devout woman, a sort of Hindu St. Elisabeth, fasting, giving alms to the poor, and nursing the sick. In Gandhi's family the Ramayana was read regularly. His first teacher was a Brahman who taught him to memorize the texts of Vishnu.[7] In later years Gandhi expressed regret at not being a better Sanskrit scholar, and one of his grievances against English education in India is that it makes the natives lose the treasures of their own language. Gandhi became, however, a profound student of Hindu scriptures, although he read the Vedas and the Upanishads in translation only.[8]
U||While still a boy he passed through a severe religious crisis. Shocked at the idolatrous form sometimes assumed by Hinduism, he became, or imagined he became, an atheist, and to prove that religion meant nothing to him he and some friends went so far as to eat meat, a frightful sacrilege for a Hindu. And Gandhi nearly perished with disgust and mortification.[9] He was engaged at the age of eight and married at the age of twelve.[10] At nineteen he was sent to England to complete his studies at the University of London and at the law school. Before his leaving India, his mother made him take the three vows of Jaïn, which prescribe abstention from wine, meat, and sexual intercourse.
U||He arrived in London in September, 1888, and after the first few months of uncertainty and deception, during which, as he says, he "wasted a lot of time and money trying to become an Englishman," he buckled down to hard work and led a strictly regulated life. Some friends gave him a copy of the Bible, but the time to understand it had not yet come. But it was during his stay in London that he realized for the first time the beauty of the Bhagavad Gitâ. He was carried away by it. It was the light the exiled Hindu had been seeking, and it gave him back his faith. He realized that for him salvation could lie only in Hinduism.[11]
U||He returned to India in 1891, a rather sad home-coming, for his mother had just died, and the news of her death had been withheld from him. Soon afterward he began practicing law at the Supreme Court of Bombay. He abandoned this career a few years later, having come to look upon it as immoral. But even while practicing law he used to make a point of reserving the right to abandon a case if he had reason to believe it unjust.
U||At this stage of his career he met various people who stirred in him a presentiment as to his future mission in life. He was influenced by two men in particular. One of them was the "Uncrowned King of Bombay," the Parsi Dadabhai, and the other Professor Gokhale. Gokhale was one of the leading statesmen in India and one of the first to introduce educational reforms, while Dadabhai, according to Gandhi, was the real founder of the Indian nationalist movement. Both men combined the highest wisdom and learning with the utmost simplicity and gentleness.[12] It was Dadabhai who, in trying to moderate Gandhi's youthful ardor, gave him, in 1892, his first real lesson in ahimsa by teaching him to apply heroic passivity—if two such words may be linked—to public life by fighting evil, not by evil, but by love. A little later we will discuss this magic word of ahimsa, the sublime message of India to the world.
U||§ 3
U||Gandhi's activity may be divided into two periods. From 1898 to 1914 its field was South Africa; from 1914 to 1922, India.
U||That Gandhi could carry on the South-African campaign for more than twenty years without awakening any special comment in Europe is a proof of the incredible short-sightedness of our political leaders, historians, thinkers, and believers, for Gandhi's efforts constituted a soul's epopee, unequaled in our times, not only because of the intensity and the constancy of the sacrifice required, but because of the final triumph.
U||In 1890-91 some 150,000 Indian emigrants were settled in South Africa, most of them having taken up abode in Natal. The white population resented their presence, and the Government encouraged the xenophobia of the whites by a series of oppressive measures designed to prevent the immigration of Asiatics and to oblige those already settled in Africa to leave. Through systematic persecution the life of the Indians in Africa was made intolerable; they were burdened with overwhelming taxes and subjected to the most humiliating police ordinances and outrages of all sorts, ranging from the looting and destruction of shops and property to lynching, all under cover of "white" civilization.
U||In 1893 Gandhi was called to Pretoria on an important case. He was not familiar with the situation in South Africa, but from the very first he met with illuminating experiences. Gandhi, a Hindu of high race, who had always been received with the greatest courtesy in England and Europe, and who until then had looked upon the whites as his natural friends, suddenly found himself the butt of the vilest affronts. In Natal, and particularly in Dutch Transvaal, he was thrown out of hotels and trains, insulted, beaten, and kicked. He would have returned to India at once if he had not been bound by contract to remain a year in South Africa. During these twelve months he learned the art of self-control, but all the time he longed for his contract to expire, so that he might return to India. But when at last he was about to leave, he learned that the South-African Government was planning to pass a bill depriving the Indians of the franchise. The Indians in Africa were helpless, unable to defend themselves; they were c
U||ompletely unorganized and demoralized. They had no leader, no one to guide them. Gandhi felt that it was his duty to defend them. He realized it would be wrong to leave. The cause of the disinherited Indians became his. He gave himself up to it, and remained in Africa.
U||Then began an epic struggle between spirit on one side and governmental power and brute force on the other. Gandhi was a lawyer at the time, and his first step was to prove the illegality of the Asiatic Exclusion Act from the point of view of law, and he won his case despite the most virulent opposition. In this connection he had huge petitions signed; he organized the Indian Congress at Natal, and formed an association for Indian education. A little later he founded a paper, "Indian Opinion," published in English and three Indian languages. Finally, in order to work more efficaciously for his compatriots in Africa, he decided to become one of them. He had a lucrative clientele in Johannesburg (Gokhale says Gandhi was making at that time about five or six thousand pounds a year). He gave it up to espouse poverty, like St. Francis. He abandoned all ties in order to live the life of the persecuted Indians, to share their trials. And he ennobled them thereby, for he taught them the doctrine of non-resistance. I
U||n 1904 he founded at Phoenix, near Durban, an agricultural colony along Tolstoian lines.[13] He called upon his compatriots, gave them land, and made them take the solemn oath of poverty. He took upon himself the humblest tasks.
U||For years the silent colony resisted the Government. It withdrew from the cities, gradually paralyzing the industrial life of the country, carrying on a sort of religious strike against which violence—all violence—was powerless, just as the violence of imperial Rome was powerless against the faith of the first Christians. Yet very few of these early Christians would have carried the doctrine of love and forgiveness so far as to help their persecutors when in danger, as Gandhi did. Whenever the South-African state was in serious difficulties Gandhi suspended the non-participation of the Indian population in public services and offered his assistance. In 1899, during the Boer War, he organized an Indian Red Cross, which was twice cited for bravery under fire. When the plague broke out in Johannesburg in 1904, Gandhi organized a hospital. In 1908 the natives in Natal revolted. Gandhi organized and served at the head of a corps of brancardiers, and the Government of Natal tendered him public thanks.
U||But these disinterested services did not disarm the hatred of the whites. Gandhi was frequently arrested and imprisoned,[14] and shortly after official thanks had been proffered for his services during the war he was sentenced to imprisonment and hard labor, after being beaten by the mob and left behind as dead.[15] But no abuse, no persecution, could make Gandhi renounce his ideal. On the contrary, his faith in it grew stronger for his trials. His only reply to the violence meted out to him in South Africa was the famous little book, "Hind Swaraj,"[16] published in 1908. This pamphlet on Indian home rule is the gospel of heroic love.
U||For twenty years the struggle lasted, reaching its bitterest phase from 1907 to 1914. Although the most intelligent and broad-minded Englishmen in Africa were opposed to it, in 1906 the South-African Government hastily passed a new Asiatic law. This led Gandhi to organize non-resistance on a large scale.
U||In September, 1906, a huge demonstration took place at Johannesburg, and the assembled Indians solemnly took the oath of passive resistance. The Chinese in Africa joined the Hindus; and Asiatics of all races, religions, and castes, rich and poor alike, brought the same enthusiasm and abnegation to the cause. The Asiatics were thrown into prison by the thousand, and as the jails were not large enough, they were hurled into the mine-pits. But it was as if the prisons fascinated these people whom General Smuts, their persecutor, called "conscientious objectors." Three times Gandhi was thrown into jail,[17] while others died as martyrs. The movement grew. In 1918 it spread from the Transvaal to Natal. Huge strikes and monster meetings, masses of Hindus marching across Transvaal, alarmed and excited public opinion in Africa and Asia. All India was stirred to indignation, and the viceroy, Lord Hardinge, driven by public opinion, finally lodged a protest against the Government of South Africa.
U||The indomitable tenacity and the magic of the "Great Soul" operated and won out: force had to bow down before heroic gentleness.[18] The man most bitterly opposed to the Indians, General Smuts, who in 1909 had said he would never erase from the statutes a measure prejudicial to the Indians, confessed, five years later, in 1914, that he was glad to do away with it.[19] An imperial commission backed Gandhi up on almost every point. In 1914 an act abolished the three-pound poll-tax, while Natal was opened to all Indians desirous of settling there as free workers. After twenty years of sacrifice non-resistance was triumphant.
U||§ 4
U||When Gandhi returned to India he had the prestige of a leader.
U||Since the beginning of the century the movement for Indian independence had been steadily gaining ground, Thirty years before, a few broadminded Englishmen, among whom were A. O. Hume and Sir William Wedderburn, had organized a National Indian Congress. Victorian Liberals, they had given the Congress a loyalist stamp and had tried to consolidate India's claims with the demands of England's sovereignty. In the meantime, however, Japan's victory over Russia had awakened the pride of Asiatic peoples, and Indian patriots resented Lord Curzon's provocative attitude. An extremist party was formed in the heart of the Congress, and its more aggressive nationalism corresponded to a general sentiment throughout the country. Until the war of 1914, however, the old constitutional part remained under the leadership of G. K. Gokhale, who was a great Indian patriot, although he believed in loyalty to England.
U||Although the Indian Congress, reflecting general sentiment, was in favor of home rule, or Swaraj, the various members disagreed as to the form this home rule should take. Some members believed in cooperation with England; others wanted to drive the English out of India. Some advocated the dominion system, as in Canada, while others asserted that India should aspire to become an independent nation like Japan. Gandhi proposed a solution. It was religious rather than political, but at bottom it was more radical than any of the others. The principles are to be found in his "Hind Swaraj." But as this solution was based on conditions in South Africa, Gandhi realized it would have to be modified to suit conditions in India. He also realized that while his stay in South Africa had made him unfamiliar with conditions in India, it had proved what an irresistible weapon ahimsa, non-violence, could be. And he determined, therefore, to study conditions in India in order to adapt the weapon of ahimsa to them.[20]
U||At this time Gandhi felt no antagonism for England. On the contrary, when the war broke out in 1914, he went to London to organize an Indian ambulance corps. As he explained in a letter written in 1921, he honestly believed himself a citizen of the empire. He refers to his attitude again and again, as in his letter addressed to "Every Englishman in India," published in 1920. No Englishman, he says, served the Government more faithfully than he during twenty-nine years of public life. He risked his life four times for England, and until 1919 he sincerely believed in cooperating with the Government. But now he can do so no longer.
U||Gandhi was not the only one to experience this change of feeling. In 1914 all India had been carried away by the hypocritical idealism of the so-called "war for justice." In asking for India's support the English Government had held out the most brilliant hopes. The granting of home rule, which the people longed for, was said to depend on India's attitude in the war. In August, 1917, the clever Indian secretary, E. S. Montagu, promised India a government responsible to the people. A consultation took place, and in July, 1918, the viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, and Mr. Montagu signed an official report recommending constitutional reform in India. The Allied armies were in a most precarious position in the early days of 1918. On April 2 Lloyd George had sent an appeal to the people of India, while the war conference, sitting at Delhi in the end of the same month, had hinted that the hour of India's independence was near. And India had replied as one man while Gandhi promised England his loyal backing. India contrib
U||uted 985,000 men and made tremendous sacrifices. And she waited confidently for the promised reward.
U||The awakening was terrible. Danger was over in the end of 1918, and gone was the memory of services rendered. After the signing of the armistice the Government saw no reason for feigning any longer. Instead of granting the promised liberties, it suspended whatever freedom already existed. The Rowlatt bills, proposed at the Imperial Legislative Council at Delhi, expressed an insulting distrust of the country which had given so many proofs of its loyalty. These bills aimed to establish definitively the provisions of the Defense Act imposed on India dining the war, and made secret police services, censorship, and all the tyrannical annoyances of a real state of siege into a permanent reality. There was one burst of indignation all over India. The revolt began.[21] Gandhi led it.
U||Hitherto Gandhi had been interested in social reforms only, devoting himself particularly to the conditions of agricultural workers. At Kaira, in the Gujarat, and at Champaran, in Behar, he had almost unnoticeably and with success tried out the formidable weapon which he was soon to use in national struggles. This weapon was the will of active passionate non-resistance. We will study it later under the name of Satyagraha, which Gandhi has given it.
U||Until 1919, however, Gandhi did not participate actively in the Indian nationalist movement. Having been united in 1916 by Mrs. Annie Besant, the most advanced elements soon outdistanced her and rallied under the leadership of the great Hindu, Lokamanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a man of extraordinary energy, uniting, as in a triple sheaf of iron, a great mind, a strong will, and a high character. His intelligence was perhaps even keener than Gandhi's, or, rather, it was more solidly nourished on old Asiatic culture. He was an erudite, a mathematician, who had sacrificed all personal ambitions to serve his country. Like Gandhi, he sought no personal recognition and longed only for the triumph of his ideal in order to be able to retire from the political field and go back to his scientific work. As long as he lived he was the undisputed leader of India. Who can say what would have happened if he had not met with an untimely death in 1920? If Tilak had lived, Gandhi, who revered Tilak's genius, while differing radi
U||cally from him in regard to methods and policies, would no doubt have remained religious leader of the movement. How magnificently the people of India could have marched on under such a double leadership! They would have been irresistible, for Tilak was a master of action, just as Gandhi is a master of spiritual power. But fate decided otherwise. It is, perhaps, to be regretted, not only for Tilak's sake, but for India's and even for Gandhi's. The rôle of minority leader, of leader of the moral élite, would have been more in accordance with Gandhi's inmost desires and nature. He would have been happy to let Tilak rule the majority, for Gandhi never had any faith in majorities. But Tilak had. Tilak, a born mathematician and master of action, believed in numbers. He was democratic instinctively. He was resolutely a politician, who left religious considerations aside. He claimed that politics were not for sadhus (saints, pious men). This austere scientist would have sacrificed truth to patriotism. And this sc
U||rupulously honest and upright man, whose personal life was one of spotless purity, did not hesitate to say that in politics everything is justified. It might be said that Tilak's conception of politics and that of the dictators of Moscow have something in common. Not so with Gandhi's ideal.[22] Tilak's and Gandhi's discussions brought out their different points of view. Between men as sincere as they there is bound to be irreconcilable opposition, since their methods are based on their convictions, which are in fundamental opposition. Each man respected and revered the other. But Gandhi felt that if it came to the point he would always set truth first before liberty and even before his country, whereas Tilak set his country above everything. Gandhi feels that no matter how great his love for his country may be, his faith in his ideal, in religion as expressed in Truth, is greater still.
U||As he says on August 11,1920:
U||    I am wedded to India because I believe absolutely that she has a mission for the world ... My religion has no geographical limits. I have a living faith in it which will transcend even my love for India herself.[23]
U||These noble words give the key to the struggle which we now will describe. They prove that the Apostle of India is the Apostle of the World, and that he is one of us. The battle the Mahatma began fighting four years ago is our battle.[24]
U||§ 5
U||It should be noted that when Gandhi stepped into the political field as leader of the opposition to the Rowlatt bills, he was moved only by a desire to spare the country from violence.[25] The revolt was bound to come; he knew there was no possibility of avoiding it. The point, therefore, was to turn it into non-violent channels.
U||To understand Gandhi's activity, it should be realized that his doctrine is like a huge edifice composed of two different floors or grades. Below is the solid groundwork, the basic foundation of religion. On this vast and unshakable foundation is based the political and social campaign. It is not the ideal continuation of the invisible foundation, but it is the best structure possible under present conditions. It is adapted to conditions.
U||In other words, Gandhi is religious by nature, and his doctrine is essentially religious. He is a political leader by necessity, because other leaders disappear, and the force of circumstances obliges him to pilot the ship through the storm and give practical political expression to his doctrine. These developments are interesting, but the essential part of the edifice is the crypt, which is deep and well built and meant to uphold a very different cathedral from the structure rapidly rising above it. The crypt alone is durable. The rest is temporary and only designed to serve during the transition years, until the plans for a cathedral worthy of the groundwork can be worked out. An understanding of the principles on which the vast subterranean crypt is based is essential, therefore, for here Gandhi's thought finds its real expression. It is into the depths of this crypt that he descends every day to seek inspiration and strength to carry on the work above.
U||Gandhi believes in the religion of his people, in Hinduism. But he is not a scholar, attached to the punctilious interpretation of texts, nor is he a blind believer accepting unquestioningly all the traditions of his religion. His religion must satisfy his reason and correspond to the dictates of his conscience.
U||    I would not make a fetish of religion and condone evil in its sacred name.[26]
U||    My belief in the Hindu scripture does not require me to accept every word and every verse as divinely inspired. I decline to be bound by any interpretation however learned it may be if it is repugnant to reason or moral sense.[27]
U||Nor does he look upon Hinduism as the only religion, and this is a very important point.
U||    I do not believe in the exclusive divinity of the Vedas. I believe the Bible, the Koran and the Zend-Avesta to be as divinely inspired as the Vedas.... Hinduism is not a missionary religion. In it there is room for the worship of all the prophets in the world ... Hinduism tells every one to worship God according to his own faith or Dharma and so it lives in peace with all religions.[28]
U||He sees the errors and vices that have crept into religion through the centuries, and he brands them, but he adds:
U||    I can no more describe my feeling for Hinduism than for my own wife. She moves me as no other woman in the world can. Not that she has no faults; I dare say, she has many more than I see myself. But the feeling of an indissoluble bond is there. Even so I feel about Hinduism with all its faults and limitations. Nothing elates me so much as the music of the Gitâ or the Ramayana by Tulasidas, the only two books in Hinduism I may be said to know. I know that vice is going on to-day in all the great Hindu shrines but I love them in spite of their failings. I am a reformer through and through. But my zeal never takes me to the rejection of any of the essential things of Hinduism.[29]
U||What are the essential things in which Gandhi believes? In an article written October 6,1921, Gandhi defines his conception of Hinduism:
U||1. He believes, he says, in the "Vedas, the Upanishads, the Puranas and all that goes by the name of Hindu scriptures." He believes, therefore, in Avataras and rebirth.
U||2. He believes in the Varnashrama Dharma[30] or the "Discipline of the Castes," in a sense which he considers "strictly Vedic," but which may not correspond to the present "popular and crude sense."
U||3. He believes in the "protection of the cow in a much larger sense than the popular."
U||4. He does not "disbelieve in idol worship."
U||Every Occidental who reads Gandhi's "Credo" and stops at these lines is apt to feel that they reveal a mentality so different from ours and so far removed in time and space as to make comparison with our ideals impossible, owing to the lack of a common measure. But if he will read on, he will find, a few lines below, the following words, which express a doctrine more familiar to us:
U||    I believe implicitly in the Hindu aphorism that no one truly knows the Shastras who has not attained perfection in Innocence [Ahimsa], Truth [Satya], and Self-Control [Brahma-Charya] and who has not renounced all acquisition or possession of wealth.
U||Here the words of the Hindu join those of the Gospel. And Gandhi was aware of their similarity. To an English clergyman who asked him in 1920 which books had influenced him most, Gandhi replied, "The New Testament."[31]
U||The last words of Gandhi's "Ethical Religion" are a quotation from the New Testament,[32] and he claims that the revelation of passive resistance came to him after reading the Sermon on the Mount in 1893.[33] When the clergyman asked him, in surprise, if he had not found the same message in Hindu scriptures, Gandhi replied that while he has found inspiration and guidance in the Bhagavad Gitâ, which he reveres and admires, the secret of passive resistance was made clear to him through the New Testament. A great joy welled up in him, he says, when the revelation came to him, and again when the Gitâ confirmed this revelation.[34] Gandhi also says that Tolstoi's ideal, that the kingdom of God is within us, helped him mold his own faith into a real doctrine.[35]
U||It should not be forgotten that this Asiatic believer has translated Ruskin[36] and Plato[37] and quotes Thoreau, admires Mazzini, reads Edward Carpenter, and that he is, in short, familiar with the best that Europe and America have produced.
U||There is no reason why a Westerner should not understand Gandhi's doctrine as well as Gandhi understands those of our great men, provided the Westerner will take the trouble to study Gandhi a little deeply. It is true that the mere words of Gandhi's creed may surprise him, and that two paragraphs, in fact, if read superficially, may seem so different from our mentality as to form an almost insurmountable barrier between the religious ideals of Asia and Europe. One of these paragraphs refers to cow-protection and the other to the caste system. As for Gandhi's reference to idol-worship, it requires no special study. Gandhi explains his attitude when he says that he has no veneration for idols but believes idol-worship to be part of human nature. He considers it inherent to the frailty of the human mind, because we all "hanker after symbolism" and must needs materialize our faith in order really to understand it. When Gandhi says he does not disbelieve in idol-worship, he means no more than what we countenance 
U||in all our ritualistic churches of the West.
U||"Cow-protection," says Gandhi, is the central fact of Hinduism. He looks upon it as one of the "most wonderful phenomena of human evolution." Why? Because the cow, to him, is taken as the symbol of the entire "sub-human world." Cow-protection means that man concludes a pact of alliance with his dumb brethren; it signifies fraternity between man and beast. According to Gandhi's beautiful expression, by learning to respect, revere, an animal, man is "taken beyond his species and is enjoined to realize his identity with all that lives."
U||If the cow was selected in preference to other creatures it was because in India the cow was the best companion, the giver of plenty. Not only did she give the milk but she made agriculture possible. And Gandhi sees in "this gentle animal" a "poem of pity."
U||But there is nothing idolatrous about Gandhi's cow-worship, and no one condemns more harshly than he the fetishism of many so-called believers, who observe the letter of "cow-worship" without exercising a spirit of compassion "for the dumb creatures of God." Whoever understands the spirit of compassion and fellow-feeling that Gandhi would have men feel for their dumb brethren,—and who would have understood this better than the poverello Assisi?—is not surprised that Gandhi lays such stress on cow-protection in his creed. From this point of view he is quite justified in saying that cow-protection is the "gift of Hinduism to the world." To the precept of the gospel, "Love thy neighbor as thyself," Gandhi adds, "And every living being is thy neighbor."[38]
U||Gandhi's belief in the caste system is almost more difficult for a European or Western mind to understand—it seems more foreign, almost, than the idea of the fellowship of all living beings. I should perhaps say "European or Western mind of to-day," for while we still believe in a certain equality, Heaven knows how we will feel in the future, when we become thoroughly imbued with the consequences of the evolution, democratic in name only, which we are undergoing! I do not imagine that at our present stage of development my explanation of Gandhi's views will make them seem acceptable as regards the caste system; nor am I anxious to have them seem so. But I would like to make it clear that Gandhi's conception of the caste system is different from what we usually mean by that term, since he does not base it on pride or vain notions of social superiority, but on duties.
U||    I am inclined to think [he says] that the law of heredity is an eternal law, and that any attempt to alter it must lead to utter confusion ... Varnashrama or the caste system, is inherent in human nature. Hinduism has simply reduced it to a science.
U||Gandhi believes in four classes or castes. The Brahmans, the intellectual and spiritual class; the the military and governmental class; the Vaishyas, the commercial, industrial class; and the Shudras, manual workers and laborers. This classification does not imply any superiority or inferiority. It simply stands for different vocations. "These classes define duties, they confer no privileges."[39]
U||    It is against the genius of Hinduism to arrogate to oneself a higher status or assign others to a lower. All are born to serve God's creation, the Brahman with his knowledge, the Kshatriya with his power of protection, the Vaishya with his commercial ability, the Shudra with his bodily labor.
U||    This does not mean that a Brahman is absolved from bodily labor but it does mean that he is predominantly a man of knowledge and fittest by training and heredity to impart it to others. There is nothing again to prevent a Shudra from acquiring all the knowledge he wishes. Only he will best serve with his body and need not envy others their special qualities for service. A Brahman who claims superiority by right of knowledge falls and has no knowledge. Varnashrama is self-restraint and conservation of economy and energy....
U||Gandhi's caste system is based, therefore, on "abnegation and not on privileges." It should not be forgotten, moreover, that according to Hinduism reincarnation reestablishes a general equilibrium, as in the course of successive existences a Brahman becomes a Shudra, and vice versa.
U||The caste system, which deals with different classes of equal rank, bears no relation whatsoever to the attitude of Hindus to the "untouchables," or pariahs. We will study later on Gandhi's passionate appeals for the pariahs. His campaign in favor of the "suppressed classes" is one of the most appealing phases of his apostleship. Gandhi regards the pariah system as a blot on Hinduism; it is a vile deformation of the real doctrine, and he suffers intolerably by it.
U||    I would rather be torn to pieces than disown my brothers of the suppressed classes.... I do not want to be reborn, but if I have to be reborn, I should be "untouchable" so that I may share their sorrows, sufferings and the affronts leveled at them in order that I may endeavor to free them from their miserable condition.
U||And he adopts a little "untouchable" girl and speaks with emotion of this charming little imp of seven who rules the household with her gay prattle.
U||§ 6
U||I have said enough to show Gandhi's great evangelical heart beating under his Hindu creed. Gandhi is a Tolstoi in a more gentle, appeased, and, if I dared, I would say, in a more Christian sense, for Tolstoi is not so much a Christian by nature as by force of will.
U||The resemblance between the two men is greatest, or perhaps Tolstoi's influence has been strongest, in their condemnation of European and Occidental civilization.
U||Ever since Rousseau our Western civilization has been attacked by the freest and broadest minds of Europe. When Asia began to wake to a realization of her own power and revolt against Western oppression, she had only to peer into Europe's own files to compile formidable records of the iniquity of her so-called civilized invaders. Gandhi did not fail to do so, and in his "Hind Swaraj" he cites a list of books, many of which were written by Englishmen, condemning European civilization. But the document to which there can be no rejoinder is that which Europe herself has traced in the lifeblood of races oppressed and despoiled in the name of lying principles and, above all, in the brazen revelation of Europe's lies, greed, and ferocity as unfolded during the last war, called the "War for Civilization." And in it Europe sank to such depths that in her insanity she even invited the peoples of Asia and Africa to contemplate her nudity. They saw her and judged her.
U||    The last war has shown as nothing else has the Satanic[40] nature of the civilization that dominates Europe to-day. Every canon of public morality has been broken by the victors in the name of virtue. No lie has been considered too foul to be uttered. The motive behind every crime is not religious or spiritual but grossly material... Europe to-day is only nominally Christian. In reality it is worshipping Mammon.[41]
U||You will find sentiments such as these expressed again and again, during the last five years, both in India and Japan. Leaders too prudent to voice them openly show by their attitude that such is their inmost conviction. This is not the least disastrous result of the Pyrrhic victory of 1918.
U||Gandhi, however, had seen the real face of Western civilization long before 1914. It had revealed itself to him unmasked during his twenty years' campaign in South Africa, and in 1908, in his "Hind Swaraj," he calls modern civilization the "great vice."
U||Civilization, says Gandhi, is civilization in name only. In reality it corresponds to what ancient Hinduism called the dark ages. It has set material well-being up as the only goal of life. It scorns spiritual values. It maddens Europeans, leads them to worship money only, and prevents them from finding peace or cultivating the best within them. Civilization in the Western sense means hell for the weak and for the working classes. It saps the vitality of the race. But this Satanic civilization will destroy itself. Western civilization is India's real enemy, much more than the English, who, individually, are not bad, hut simply suffer from their civilization. Gandhi criticizes those of his compatriots who would want to drive out the English, to develop India themselves, and civilize her according to European standards. This, he says, would be like having the nature of a tiger without the tiger. India's aim should be to repudiate Western civilization.
U||In his arraignment of Western civilization Gandhi scores three categories of men particularly: magistrates, doctors, and teachers.
U||Gandhi's objection to teachers is quite comprehensible, since they have brought the Hindus up to scorn or neglect their own language and to disown their real aspirations; in fact, the teachers in India have inflicted a sort of national degradation on the schoolchildren in their charge. Besides, Western teachers appeal to the mind only; they neglect the education of the heart and of the character. Finally, they depreciate bodily labor, and to spread a purely literary education in a country where eighty per cent of the population is agricultural and ten per cent industrial is positively criminal.
U||The profession of magistrate is immoral. In India the courts are an instrument of British domination; they encourage dissensions among Indians, and in a general way they foster and increase misunderstanding and animosity. They stand for a fattening, lucrative exploitation of the worst instincts.
U||As for the medical profession, Gandhi admits he was attracted to it at first, but he soon realized it was not honorable. For Western medical science is concerned with giving relief to suffering bodies only. It does not strive to do away with the cause of suffering and disease, which, as a rule, is nothing but vice. In fact, Western medical science may almost be said to encourage vice by making it possible for a man to satisfy his passions and appetites at the least possible risk. It contributes, therefore, to demoralize people; it weakens their will-power by helping them to cure themselves with "black magic" prescriptions instead of forcing them to strengthen their character by disciplinary rules for body and soul.[42] In opposition to the false medical science of the West, which Gandhi has often criticized unfairly, he places preventive medical science. He has written a little pamphlet on the subject entitled "A Guide to Health," which is the fruit of twenty years' experience. It is a moral as well as a the
U||rapeutic treatise, for, according to Gandhi, "disease is the result of our thoughts as much as of our acts." He considers it a relatively simple matter to establish certain rules that will prevent disease. For all disease springs from the same origin, i. e., from neglect of the natural laws of health. The body is God's dwelling-place. It must be kept pure. There is truth in Gandhi's point of view, but he refuses a little too obstinately to recognize the efficacy of remedies that have really proved to be useful. His moral precepts are also extremely rigid.[43]
U||§ 7
U||But the nucleus of modern civilization, its heart, so to speak, is machinery. Age of iron! Heart of iron! The machine has become a monstrous idol. It must be done away with. Gandhi's most ardent desire is to see machinery wiped out of India. To a free India, heir to British machinery, he would prefer an India dependent on the British market. It would be better to buy materials manufactured in Manchester than to set up Manchester factories in India. An Indian Rockefeller would be no better than a European capitalist. Machinery is the great sin which enslaves nations, and money is a poison as much as sexual vice.
U||Indian progressives, however, imbued with modern ideas, ask what would become of India if she were to have no railroads, tramways, or industries? To this Gandhi asks if India did not exist before they were invented? For thousands of years India has resisted, alone, unshaken, the changing flood of empires. Everything else has passed. But thousands of years ago India learned the art of self-control and mastered the science of happiness. She has nothing to learn from other nations. She does not need the machinery of large cities. Her ancient prosperity was founded on the plow and the spinning-wheel, and on a knowledge of Hindu philosophy. India must go back to the sources of her ancient culture. Not all at once, of course, but gradually. And every one must help in the evolution.[44]
U||This is Gandhi's fundamental argument. It is a very important one, and demands discussion. For it stands for a denial of progress and, virtually, of Europe's scientific achievement.[45] This medieval conception is apt, therefore, to clash with the volcanic forward march of the human mind and incurs the risk of being blown to bits. But, first of all, it would perhaps be wiser to say, the "forward march of a certain phase of the human mind," for if one may believe, as I believe, in the symphonic unity of the universal spirit, one must realize that it is made up of many different voices, each one singing its own part. Our youthful Occident carried away by its own score, does not realize sufficiently that it has not always led the song, nor that its own law of progress is subject to eclipses, backslidings, and recommencements; that the history of human civilization is really a history of human civilizations, and that while within the domain of each civilization a certain progress may be discernible, a progress i
U||rregular, chaotic, broken, and at times completely halted, it would be wrong to say that the predominance of one great civilization over another necessarily implies general human progress.
U||But without entering into a discussion as to the European dogma of progress and merely bearing in mind that this dogma, such as it is, conflicts with Gandhi's faith, we must realize that no conflict will weaken Gandhi's faith. To believe anything else would be to show a total ignorance of the workings of the Oriental mind. As Gobineau says: "Asiatics are much more obstinate than we, in every way. They will wait centuries, if necessary, for the fulfilment of their ideal, and when it rises triumphant after such a long slumber it does not seem to have aged or lost any of its vitality." Centuries mean nothing to a Hindu. Gandhi is prepared for the triumph of his cause within the year. But he is equally prepared for it within the course of several centuries. He does not force time. And if time makes haste slowly, he regulates his gait by its march.
U||If, therefore, in the course of his campaign Gandhi finds India insufficiently prepared to understand and practise the radical reforms he wishes to impose, he will adapt his doctrine to conditions. He will bide his time. That is why it is not astonishing to hear the irreconcilable enemy of machinery declare, in 1921:
U||    I would not weep over the disappearance of machinery or consider this a calamity. But for the time being I have no designs on machinery as such.[46]
U||Or:
U||    The law of complete Love is the Law of my being. But I am not preaching this final law through the political measures I advocate. I know that any such attempt is foredoomed to failure. To expect a whole mass of men and women to obey that law all at once is not to know its working.[47] I am not a visionary. I claim to be a practical idealist.[48]
U||Gandhi never asks men for more than they can give. But he asks for all that they can give. And this is much in a nation like India—a formidable nation, through its numerical power, its force of duration, and its abysmal soul. From the very first Gandhi and India have formed a pact; they understand each other without words. Gandhi knows what he can demand of India, and India is prepared to give whatever Gandhi may demand.
U||Between Gandhi and India there reigns, first of all, absolute agreement as to goal: Swaraj, home rule, for the nation.[49]
U||"I know," he says, "that Swaraj is the object of the nation and not non-violence."
U||And he adds—words amazing on his lips, "I would rather see India freed by violence than enchained like a slave to her foreign oppressors."
U||But, he continues, correcting himself at once, this is an impossible supposition, for violence can never free India. Swaraj can only be attained by soul-force. This is India's real weapon, the invincible weapon of love and truth. Gandhi expresses it by the term Satyagraha, which he defines as truth-force and love-force.[50] Gandhi's genius revealed itself when, by the preaching of this gospel, he revealed to his people their real nature and their hidden strength.
U||Gandhi used the word Satyagraha in South Africa to explain the difference between his ideal and that of passive resistance. Particular stress must be laid on the difference between these two movements. Nothing is more false than to call Gandhi's campaign a movement of passive resistance. No one has a greater horror of passivity than this tireless fighter, who is one of the most heroic incarnations of a man who resists. The soul of his movement is active resistance—resistance which finds outlet, not in violence, but in the active force of love, faith and sacrifice. This threefold energy is expressed in the word Satyagraha.
U||Let not the coward try to hide his cowardice under Gandhi's banner! Gandhi drives him out of the community. Better violence than cowardice!
U||    Where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence I advise violence....[51] I cultivate the quiet courage of dying without killing. But to him who has not this courage I advise that of killing and of being killed, rather than that of shamefully fleeing from danger. For he who runs away commits mental violence; he runs away because he has not the courage to be killed while he kills.[52]
U||    I would risk violence a thousand times rather than emasculation of the race.[53] I would rather have India resort to arms to defend her honor than that she should in a cowardly manner become or remain a helpless victim to her own dishonor.[54]
U||    But I believe that non-violence is infinitely superior to violence, forgiveness more manly than punishment. Forgiveness adorns a soldier. Abstinence is forgiveness only when there is power to punish; it is meaningless when it pretends to proceed from a helpless creature.... I do not believe India to be helpless. One hundred thousand Englishmen need not frighten three hundred million human beings.
U||    Besides.
U||    Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will. Non-violence does not mean meek submission to the will of the evil-doer but the putting of one's whole soul against the will of the tyrant. Working under this law of our being it is possible for a single individual to defy the whole might of an unjust empire and lay the foundation for that empire's fall or its regeneration.
U||But at the cost of what? Of suffering—the great law.
U||    Suffering is the mark of the human tribe. It is an eternal law.[55] The mother suffers so that her child may live. Life comes out of death. The condition of wheat growing is that the seed grain should perish. No country has ever risen without being purified through the fire of suffering.... It is impossible to do away with the law of suffering which is the one indispensable condition of our being. Progress is to be measured by the amount of suffering undergone ... the purer the suffering, the greater is the progress.[56]
U||    Non-violence in its dynamic condition means conscious suffering.... I have ventured to place before India the ancient law of self-sacrifice, the law of suffering. The Rishis who discovered the law of non-violence in the midst of violence were greater geniuses than Newton, greater warriors than Wellington. Having themselves known the use of arms they realized their uselessness and taught a weary world that salvation lay not through violence but through non-violence.... The religion of non-violence is not meant merely for the Rishis and saints. It is meant for the common people as well. Non-violence is the law of our species as violence is the law of the brute. The dignity of man requires obedience to a higher law—to the strength of the spirit.... I want India to practise non-violence being conscious of her strength and power. I want India to recognize that she has a soul that cannot perish and that can rise triumphant above every physical weakness and defy the physical combination of a whole world.[57]
U||Exalted pride, his proud love of India, demands she should scorn violence as unworthy and be ready to sacrifice herself. Non-violence is her title of nobility. If she abandons it she falls. Gandhi cannot bear the thought.
U||    If India made violence her creed I would not care to live in India. She would cease to evoke any pride in me. My patriotism is subservient to my religion. I cling to India like a child to its mother's breast because I feel that she gives me the spiritual nourishment I need. If she were to fail me, I would feel like an orphan, without hope of ever finding a guardian. Then the snow altitudes of the Himalayas must give what rest they can to my bleeding soul....[58]
U||§ 8
U||But Gandhi does not doubt India's endurance. In February, 1919, he decided to start the Satyagraha movement, whose efficacy had already been tested during the agrarian revolt in 1918.
U||The campaign is not at all political, as yet: Gandhi is still a loyalist. And he remains one as long as he retains a grain of faith in England's loyalty. Until January, 1920, he advocated cooperation with the empire, even though the nationalists criticized him bitterly therefore.[59] Gandhi's arguments are inspired by his sincere conviction, and during the first year of his campaign against the Government he could truthfully assure Lord Hunter that he believed the disciples of Satyagraha to be the most loyal supporters of the Constitution. Only the narrow-minded obstinacy of the Government forced India's moral guide finally to tear up the contract of loyalty by which he considered himself hound.
U||To begin with, therefore, the Satyagraha campaign takes the form of constitutional opposition to the Government. It is a respectful appeal for certain urgent reforms. The Government is guilty of passing an unjust law. The Satyagrahi, who are law-abiding people, will disobey this law deliberately, because they consider it unjust. If their attitude does not convince the Government of the necessity of repealing the law, they will extend their disobedience to other laws, and eventually they may cease all cooperation with the Government. But how different is the meaning which India gives to this word from that which we in the West give to it! Such extraordinary religious heroism as is contained in it!
U||As the Satyagrahi are not allowed to use violence in advancing their cause (the idea being that the adversary, too, is sincere, since what seems truth to one person may seem untruth to another, while violence never carries conviction),[60] they must rely solely on the love-force that radiates from their faith and on their willingness to accept suffering and sacrifice joyously, freely.[61] This constitutes irresistible propaganda. With it the cross of Christ and his little flock conquered the Roman Empire.
U||In order to emphasize the religious character of the people's willingness to sacrifice themselves for the eternal ideals of justice and liberty, the Mahatma inaugurated the movement by setting April 6, 1919,[62] aside as a day of prayers and fasting, by imposing a hartal of all India.[63] This was the first step.
U||This first step went right to the heart of the people, stirred their inmost consciousness. For the first time all classes of India united in the same ideal. India found herself.
U||Order reigned everywhere. At Delhi only there were a few disturbances.[64] Gandhi set out to quiet them. But the Government had him arrested and sent him back to Bombay. The news of his arrest caused riots in Punjab; at Amritsar some houses were looted, and a few people were killed. In the night of April 11 General Dyer arrived with his troops and occupied the city. Order reigned everywhere. The fifteenth was a great Hindu feast-day. A meeting was to take place at an open space called Jallianwalla Bagh. The crowd was peaceful and numbered many women and children. The night before General Dyer had sent out an order forbidding public meetings, but no one had heard about it. The general, however, came to Jallianwalla Bagh with his machine-guns and without warning opened fire on the defenseless mass of people. The firing lasted about ten minutes, till the ammunition was used up. As the grounds were surrounded by high walls, no one could escape. From five to six hundred Hindus were killed, and a much larger numbe
U||r wounded. There was no one to care for the dead and wounded. As the result of the massacre, martial law was proclaimed, and a reign of terror spread over Punjab. Aëroplanes threw bombs on the unarmed crowds. The most honorable citizens were dragged to court, flogged, and forced to crawl on their knees, and subjected to the most shocking indignities. It was as if a wind of madness swept over the English rulers. It was as if the law of non-violence, proclaimed by India, stirred European violence to frenzy. Gandhi saw bloodshed and suffering were ahead. But he had not promised to lead his people to victory along a white road. He had warned them that the path would be washed with blood. Jallianwalla Bagh was only the beginning:
U||    We must be prepared to contemplate with equanimity not a thousand murders of innocent men and women but many thousands before we attain a status in the world that shall not be surpassed by any nation.... We hope, therefore, that all concerned will take rather than lose heart and treat hanging as an ordinary affair of life.[65]
U||Owing to the rigorous military censorship, the news of the horrors of Punjab did not leak out for several months. But when it did leak out[66] a wave of indignation swept over India and alarmed even English opinion. An investigation was ordered, and Lord Hunter presided over the commission.
U||In the meantime, the National Indian Congress formed a subcommission to carry on investigations independently of the Government, but along the same lines. It was to the obvious interest of the Government, as all intelligent Englishmen realized, to punish those guilty of the massacre of Amritsar. Gandhi did not demand as much as that. In his admirable moderation he did not ask for the punishment of General Dyer and the guilty officers. While denouncing them, he felt no bitterness and sought no vengeance. One bears no ill will to a madman. But one must put him where he can do no damage. Gandhi, therefore, merely asked that General Dyer be recalled. But quos vult perdere.... Before the results of the investigation could be published, the Government passed an indemnity act to protect official employees. Though Dyer was removed from his post, he was rewarded with money contributed from private sources.
U||While India was still in effervescence after the Punjab affair, a second conflict arose between the Government and the people, a more serious one this time, because it implied a flagrant violation of solemn promises. The Government's attitude shattered whatever confidence India still had in the good faith of the English rulers, and brought on the great revolt.
U||The European War had placed the Moslems of India in a very painful dilemma. They were torn between their duty as loyal citizens of the empire and faithful followers of their religious chief. They agreed to help England when she promised not to attack the sultan's or the caliph's sovereignty. It was the sense of Moslem opinion in India that the Turks should remain in Turkey in Europe and that the sultan should retain not only authority over the Holy Places of Islam, but over Arabia as delimited by Mohammedan scholars with the enclaves of Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine. This Lloyd George and the viceroy solemnly promised. When the war was over, however, all pledges were forgotten. And when the rumors of the peace terms to be imposed on Turkey began to circulate in 1919, the Moslems in India began to grow restless, and their discontent finally started the Khilafat or Califat movement.
U||It began October 17,1919 (Khilafat day), with an imposing peaceful demonstration, which was followed, about a month later (November 24), by the opening of an All-India Khilafat Conference at Delhi. Gandhi presided. With his quick glance he had realized that the Islamic agitation might be made into the instrument of Indian unity. The problem of uniting the various races in India was a most difficult one. The English had always taken advantage of the natural enmity between Hindus and Moslems; Gandhi even accuses them of having fostered it. At any rate, they had never tried to conciliate the two peoples, who challenged each other childishly. To annoy the Mohammedans, for instance, the Hindus used to make a point of singing when they passed the mosques where silence should reign, while the Mohammedans lost no opportunity of jeering the Hindus' cow-worship. Mutual ill will and persistent animosity reigned between the two races, who never associated with each other and were not allowed to intermarry or even eat in
U|| common. The English Government rested sweetly on the cushion of implicit trust in the impossibility of the two ever agreeing and adopting a common policy. When Gandhi's voice, therefore, proclaimed the identity of the Hindu and the Moslem cause, it awoke with a start. In an outburst of generosity, which happened to be sound politics, Gandhi urged the Hindus to do all in their power to advance Mohammedan claims.
U||    Hindus, Parsees, Christians, or Jews, if we wish to live as one nation, the interest of any one of us must be the interest of all. The only deciding consideration can be the justice of a particular cause.
U||Mohammedan blood had already mixed with that of the Hindus in the tragic massacre of Amritsar. The two people now had to seal their alliance, an unconditional alliance. The Moslems were the most advanced and audacious element in India. And they were the first to announce, at this Khilafat Conference, that they would refuse to cooperate with the Government if their demands were not met. Gandhi approved of this measure, but in his innate horror of going to extremes he refused at the time to advocate the boycott of British goods, for he looked upon the boycott as an expression of weakness or thirst for vengeance. A second Khilafat Conference met at Amritsar in the end of December, 1919, and decided to send a deputation to Europe to inform the English Government and the Supreme Council of India's attitude. It also voted for the sending of an ultimatum to the viceroy, warning him of trouble if the peace terms should prove unsatisfactory. Finally a third conference, meeting in Bombay in February, 1920, issued a ma
U||nifesto which, in its violent arraignment of Great Britain's policy, was a forerunner of the coming storm.
U||Gandhi realized the storm was brewing, and instead of trying to call it forth he did all in his power to break its violence.
U||It seemed as if England also realized the danger. By belated concessions she seemed to be making desperate efforts to avert the consequences of her former attitude. An Indian Reform Act based on the Montagu-Chelmsford report gave the people in India more influence in the Central Government as well as in local administrations. The king approved the act by a proclamation of December 24, 1919, in which he invited the people of India and the functionaries to cooperate with the Government in every way, while he also urged the viceroy to pardon political offenses and recommended a general amnesty. Gandhi, always ready to believe in the adversary's good faith, interpreted these measures as signifying a sort of tacit agreement to deal more justly with India, and he called upon the people to welcome the reforms. He confessed that they were insufficient, but he said they should be accepted as the starting-point for greater victories. He urged the conference to approve them unreservedly. After a heated debate the Natio
U||nal Indian Congress adopted his view.
U||But soon it became evident that Gandhi's hopes were built on illusions. The viceroy did not heed the king's appeal for clemency, and instead of setting prisoners free, the doors of the jails opened only for executions. It became evident that the promised reforms would remain inoperative.
U||On top of this came the news of the peace conditions imposed on Turkey, May 14, 1920. In a message to the people the viceroy admitted they would prove disappointing, but he advised the Moslems to resign themselves to the inevitable.
U||Then came the publication of the official report on the Amritsar massacres. It was the last straw.
U||India's national consciousness was aroused. All ties were broken.
U||The Khilafat Committee, meeting at Bombay, May 28, 1920, passed a resolution adopting Gandhi's non-cooperation policy, and this resolution was ratified unanimously by the Moslem Conference of Allahabad, June 80, 1920.
U||Gandhi, in the meantime, wrote an open letter to the viceroy informing him that the movement of non-cooperation would begin. He explained why he had recourse to it, and his arguments are worth studying, for they prove that even then Gandhi was hoping to avoid a break with England. In the bottom of his heart he still hoped that the Government might be brought to mend its ways by purely legal methods:
U||    The only course open to me is either in despair to sever all connection with British rule or, if I still retain faith in the inherent superiority of the British Constitution, to adopt such means as will rectify the wrong done and thus restore confidence. I have not lost faith in the superiority of the British Constitution and it is because I believe in it that I have advised my Moslem friends to withdraw their support from Your Excellency's Government, and advised the Hindus to join them.
U||And this noble citizen of the empire the blind pride of the empire spurned.

In exceptional cases, however, he says that such unions, sealed before the individual's character is molded, may build up between husband and wife an exceptionally beautiful relationship of sympathy and harmony. Gandhi's own wife is an admirable example of this. Mrs. Gandhi shared all her husband's trials and adversities with unfailing steadfastness of purpose and indomitable courage.
U||[11]Speech of April 13, 1921.
U||[12]These two men, precursors, have suffered from the ingratitude and forgetfulness of younger generations. Their political ideal having been surpassed, their efforts in paving the way have been deprecated. Gandhi, however, always realized their contribution to the cause and remained true to them, particularly to Gokhale, for whom he felt a deep and almost religious affection. He frequently speaks of Gokhale and Dadabhai as men whom Young India should venerate. (See "Hind Swaraj, Letter to the Parsecs, Young India," March 23, 1921, and the Confession of Faith, July 13, 1921.)
U||[13]A long letter from Tolstoi to Gandhi is published in the "Golden Number" of "Indian Opinion." It was written September 7, 1910, shortly before Tolstoi's death. Tolstoi had read "Indian Opinion," and he was gratified to hear of the Indian non-resisters. He praised their campaign and says that non-resistance is the law of love, an aspiration to form part of the communion of human souls. It is the law of Christ and of all the spiritual leaders of the world.
U||My friend Paul Biroukoff found several other letters from Tolstoi to Gandhi in the Tolstoi archives at Moscow. He is planning to publish them in a volume entitled "Tolstoi and the Orient," adding them to several other letters written by Tolstoi to various great men of the East.
U||[14]Gandhi himself tells in his quiet humorous way of his experiences in prison in a curious article printed in the volume, "Speeches and Writings of M. K. Gandhi," Natesan, Madras, pp. 152-178.
U||[15]In 1907 Gandhi was the victim of the violence of his own compatriots, for his moderation was eyed with suspicion by certain Indians, while, the Government, on the other hand, did all in its power to compromise him. Gandhi, therefore, suffered from the violence of the oppressed as well as of the oppressors.
U||[16]I will dwell on "Hind Swaraj" a little more at length, later on.
U||[17]Joseph J. Doke, interesting because of his interviews with Gandhi, tells in the last chapter of his book how, in 1908, Gandhi was led to the fort of Johannesburg in prison garb and thrown into a cell with Chinese common-law criminals of the worst sort.
U||[18]Two high-minded Englishmen, C. F. Andrews and W. W. Pearson, seconded Gandhi's efforts by all means within their power.
U||[19]Gandhi refers to this in an article dated May 12, 1920.
U||[20]Shortly before he died, Gokhale, Gandhi's beloved master, had suggested that Gandhi make a trip through India and study conditions at first hand, before going into politics. And Gandhi had promised not to take an active part in the political life of India for a year.
U||[21]The Satyagraha movement may be said to have begun February 28, 1919.

U||[34]He says to Joseph J. Doke in 1908 that God has been incarnate throughout the ages, in different forms, because, as explained in the Gitâ, Krishna says: "When religion falls into decadence and unbelief prevails, I manifest myself. For the protection of all that is good, and the destruction of all that is evil, for the establishment of Dharma, I must be born and reborn, for ever and ever." Christianism is part of Gandhi's theology. Christ is a radiant revelation of God. But not the only revelation. He is not seated on the throne alone.
U||[35]The "Hind Swaraj" contains a list of about sixty of Tolstoi's works which Gandhi recommends to his followers, among them, "The Kingdom of God Is within You, What Is Art?" and "What Shall We Do?" He tells Joseph Doke that Tolstoi influenced him deeply, but that he does not agree with Tolstoi's political ideals. To a question asked him in 1921 as to his feeling for and opinion of Count Tolstoi, Gandhi replies (in "Young India" of October 25, 1921), "My relation to him was that of a devoted admirer who owes him much in life."
U||[36]He was particularly fond of Ruskin's "Crown of Wild Olives."

U||[45]Although Gandhi does not approve of European science, he realizes the necessity of scientific achievement. He admires the disinterested zeal and the spirit of self-sacrifice of European men of science and frequently calls their abnegation greater than that of Hindu believers. But he disapproves the goal they are pursuing even though he admires their state of mind. There is an evident antagonism between Gandhi and European science. And in this connection we will see, later on, how Tagore protests against Gandhi's medievalism.

U||[58]A few months before his imprisonment Gandhi replies to the criticisms as to "illogic" of his conduct. His critics jeer at the assistance he tendered England in South Africa and during the World War. Gandhi, in replying, does not try to evade the issue. He honestly believed, he says, that he was a citizen of the empire; it was not his business to judge the Government. He would consider it wrong for every man to look upon himself as justified in criticizing the Government. He had confidence in England's wisdom and loyalty as long as possible. The Government's aberration has destroyed his faith in it. Let the Government take the consequences! (November 17, 1921.)

U||PART TWO
U||§ 1
U||On July 28, 1920, Gandhi announced that non-coöperation would be proclaimed August 1, and as a preparatory measure he ordered that a day of fasting and prayer be held the day before. He had no fear of governmental fury, but he feared the fury of the populace, and he bent every effort to have order and discipline reign within the Indian ranks. He declared:
U||    Effective non-coöperation depends upon complete organization. Disorderliness comes from anger. There must be no violence. Violence means retrogression in our case, and useless waste of innocent lives. Above everything else, there must be complete order.
U||The tactics of non-coöperation had been defined two months before by Gandhi and the committee of non-coöperation, and they included the following measures:
U||(1) Surrender of all titles of honor and honorary offices.
U||(2) Non-participation in government loans.
U||(3) Suspension by lawyers of practice, and settlement of court disputes by private arbitration.
U||(4) Boycott of government schools by children and parents.
U||(5) Boycott of the reformed Councils.
U||(6) Non-participation in government parties and other official functions.
U||(7) Refusal to accept any civil or military post.
U||(8) Agreements to spread the doctrine of Swadeshi.[67]
U||In other words, the negative part of the program should be completed by constructive measures, which would lead to the building up of the new India of the future.
U||This program specified the first steps to be taken, and we must admire the prudent sagacity of the leader who, after cranking up the enormous machine of Hindu revolt, stops it short, so to speak, and holds it back, pulsating, at the first turn, a method in startling opposition to that of our European revolutionaries. Gandhi is not planning civil disobedience for the present. He knows civil disobedience. He has studied it in Thoreau, whom he quotes in his articles, and he takes pains to explain the difference between it and non-coöperation. Civil disobedience, he says, is more than a mere refusal to obey the law. It means deliberate opposition to the law; it is an infraction of the law, and can be carried out only by an elite, while non-coöperation should be a mass movement. Gandhi means to prepare the masses in India for civil disobedience but they must be trained for it by a gradual process. He knows that at present people are not ripe for it, and he does not want to set them loose before he feels sure th
U||at they have mastered the art of self-control. So he launches non-coöperation. Non-coöperation, in this first stage, does not include a refusal to pay taxes. Gandhi is biding his time.
U||August 1,1920, Gandhi gives the signal for the movement by his famous letter to the viceroy, surrendering his decorations and honorary titles:
U||    It is not without a pang that I return the Kaisar-i-Hind Gold Medal granted to me by your predecessor for my humanitarian work in South Africa, the Zulu War Medal, granted in South Africa for my services as officer in charge of the Indian Volunteer Ambulance Corps in 1906, and the Boer War Medal for my services as assistant superintendent of the Indian Volunteer Stretcher-bearer Corps during the Boer War of 1899-1900.
U||But, he adds, after referring to the scenes that took place in the Punjab and the events back of the Khilafat movement:
U||    I can retain neither respect nor affection for a Government which has been moving from wrong to wrong in order to defend its immorality.... The Government must be moved to repentance.
U||    I have therefore ventured to suggest non-coöperation which enables those who wish to disassociate themselves from the Government and which, if unattended by violence, must compel the Government co retrace its steps and undo its wrongs.
U||And Gandhi expresses the hope that the viceroy will see his way to do justice, and that he will call a conference of the recognized leaders of the people, and consult with them.
U||Gandhi's example was immediately followed. Hundreds of magistrates sent in their resignations, thousands of students left the colleges, the courts were abandoned, the schools were emptied. The All-India Congress, meeting in special session in Calcutta in the beginning of September, approved Gandhi's decisions by an overwhelming majority. Gandhi and his friend Maulana Shaukat Ali toured the country and met with tremendous ovations everywhere.
U||Never did Gandhi show himself a greater leader than during the first year of his action. He had to hold back the violence that lay smoldering, ready to leap into flame at the slightest provocation. Gandhi fears and abhors mob violence more than anything else. He considers "mobocracy" the greatest danger that menaces India. He hates war, but would rather have it than the insane violence of Caliban. "If India has to achieve her freedom by violence, let it be by the disciplined violence named war," not by mob revolts. Gandhi looks with disfavor upon all demonstrations and mass-meetings, even in celebration of some joyous event, for out of a large crowd filled with noise and confusion frenzied violence may burst for no apparent reason. And he insists on the necessity of maintaining strict discipline. "We must evolve order out of chaos," he says, "introduce people's law instead of mob law." And the mystic with the clear, firm eyes, whose sound practical sense equals that of the great European mystics who founded 
U||religious orders and dominated the souls of men, gives precise, detailed rules as to how to canalize the torrents of popular meetings and demonstrations.
U||"One great stumbling-block," he says, speaking of the organization of mass-meetings, "is that we have neglected music. Music means rhythm, order. Unfortunately, in India, music has been the prerogative of the few. It has never become nationalized.... I would make compulsory a proper singing, in company, of national songs. And to that end I would have great musicians attending every congress or conference and teaching mass music. Nothing is so easy as to train mobs, for the simple reason that they have no mind, no meditation."
U||Gandhi makes a list of suggestions. No raw volunteers should be accepted to assist in the organization of the big demonstrations. None but the most experienced should be at the head. Volunteers should always have a general instruction-book on their persons. They should be dispersed among the crowd and should learn flag and whistle signaling to pass instructions. National cries should be fixed and raised at the right moment. Crowds should be prevented from entering the railroad stations; they should be taught to stand back and leave a clear passage in the streets for people and carriages. Little children should never be brought out in the crowds, etc.
U||In other words, Gandhi makes himself the orchestra leader of his oceans of men.[68]
U||§ 2
U||But while the mob may break out into violence, unconsciously, blindly, moved by a sudden unreasonable impulse, there is a political faction which advocates violence deliberately and consciously. Many of the best men in India believe that national independence can be reached only by violent methods. This faction does not understand Gandhi's doctrine and does not believe in its political efficacy. It demands action, direct action. Gandhi receives anonymous letters urging him to stop advocating non-violence, and, worse, others implying cynically that his doctrine of non-violence is merely a mask and that the time has now come to throw it aside and give the signal for battle. Gandhi replies vehemently. He discusses the arguments passionately.[69] In a series of beautiful articles he censures the "doctrine of the sword." He denies that Hindu scriptures and the Koran approve violence. Violence is not part of the doctrine of any religion. Jesus is the prince of passive resistance. The Bhagavad Gitâ does not preach
U|| violence, but the fulfilment of duty even at the cost of one's life.[70] As man has not been given the power to create, he has not the right to destroy the smallest creature that lives. There must be no hatred for any one, not even for the evil-doer; but this does not mean that one should tolerate evil. Gandhi would nurse General Dyer if he were ill, but if his own son lived a life of shame, he would not help him by continuing to support him. On the contrary, "my love for him would require me to withdraw all support from him, although this might even mean his death." No one has the right to compel another by physical force to become good. "But one is under the obligation to resist him by leaving him, no matter what may happen, and by welcoming him to one's bosom if he repents."[71]
U||While Gandhi curbs the violent elements, he stimulates the hesitating. He reassures those who are afraid of taking a decisive step:
U||    Never has anything been done on this earth without direct action. I rejected the word "passive resistance" because of its insufficiency.... It was, however, direct action in South Africa which told, and told so effectively that it converted General Smuts to sanity. What was the larger "symbiosis" that Buddha and Christ preached? Gentleness and love. Buddha fearlessly carried the war into the enemy's camp and brought down on its knees an arrogant priesthood. Christ drove out the money-changers from the temple of Jerusalem and drew down curses from heaven upon the hypocrites and the Pharisees. Both were for intensely direct action. But even as Buddha and Christ chastened, they showed unmistakable gentleness and love behind every act of theirs.[72]
U||Gandhi also appeals to the generosity and the common sense of the English.[73] He calls the English his "dear friends" and points out that he has been their faithful companion for more than thirty years. He asks them to make up for the Government's perfidy, which by its treachery has completely shattered his faith in its good intentions. But he still believes in English bravery and in English respect for other people's bravery. "Bravery on the battle-field is impossible for India, but bravery of the soul remains open to us. Non-coöperation means nothing less than training in self-sacrifice. I expect to conquer you by my suffering."
U||In the first four or five months' preliminary campaign Gandhi was not trying to paralyze the Government through non-coöperation; his idea was rather to lay the foundation for the building up of a new India which would be independent mentally, morally, and economically. Gandhi expresses the idea of India's economic independence by the term Swadeshi, and he takes the word in its narrow and physical sense.
U||India must learn to go without many comforts and to accept hardships without a murmur. A salutary discipline, this; necessary moral hygiene. The nation's health as well as its character will benefit thereby. Gandhi's first move is to free India from the curse of drink. Groups must be formed to advocate temperance. European wines must be boycotted; liquor-dealers must be induced to surrender their licenses.[74] All India responded to the Mahatma's appeal. Such a strong wave of temperance swept over India that Gandhi had to interfere to prevent the crowds from sacking and looting the wine-shops and closing them by force. "You must not try to compel another by physical force to become good," he explained to the masses.
U||But if it was a relatively easy matter to rid India of the curse of drink, it was much more difficult to provide her with means of subsistence. If cooperation with England ceased, what would India live on? What would she clothe herself in if European products were tabooed? Gandhi's solution is one of utmost simplicity and reveals the medieval turn of his mind: he undertakes to reestablish the old Indian industry of home spinning, introduce the spinning-wheels.
U||This patriarchal solution of the social problem has naturally met with ridicule.[75] But conditions in India and Gandhi's interpretation of the term charka must, be taken into consideration. Gandhi has never claimed that spinning alone would constitute a means of livelihood except for the very poor; but he does claim that it could supplement agriculture during the months when work in the fields is at a standstill. India's problem is not theoretical, but real and pressing. Eighty per cent of the population of India is agricultural, and is therefore without employment virtually four months of the year. One tenth of the population is normally exposed to famine. The middle class is underfed. What has England done to remedy these conditions? Nothing. On the contrary, she has aggravated them, for English manufactures have ruined local industries, pumped the resources of India, bleeding the country for more than sixty million rupees a year. India, who grows all the cotton she requires, is forced to export millions 
U||of bales to Japan and Lancashire, whence it is returned to her in the form of manufactured calico, which she must buy at exorbitant prices. The first thing for India to do, therefore, is to learn to do without ruinous foreign goods, and in order to do this she must organize workshops of her own to give employment and food to her people. There is no time to lose. Now, nothing can be organized more rapidly and economically than the industry of spinning and weaving at home. The idea is not to induce well paid agricultural laborers to give up their work and to spin, but to urge the unemployed, and all those who do not have to work for a living, such as women and children, as well as all Hindus who may have some spare time during the day, to spin in their leisure hours. Gandhi orders, therefore, (1) the boycotting of foreign goods, (2) the teaching of spinning and weaving, (3) the buying of hand-woven cloth only.
U||Gandhi gives himself up tirelessly to this idea. He says spinning is a duty for all India.[76] He wants poor children to pay for their tuition at school by a certain number of hours of spinning; he wants every one, man and woman, to contribute at least one hour a day, as charity, to spinning. He gives the most precise directions as to the choice of cotton, spinning-wheels, etc., and information on all sorts of technical details of spinning and weaving; he gives practical advice to those who wish to buy hand-woven cloth, to the fathers of large families, as well as to pupils in the schools. He explains, for instance, how one may start a Swadeshi shop—a shop dealing in the products of Hindu industry—with but little capital, make ten per cent profits, etc. He becomes lyrical when he describes the "music of the spinning-wheel,"[77] the oldest music in India, which delighted Kahir, the poet-weaver, and Aureng-Zeb, the great emperor, who wove his own caps.
U||Gandhi was able to fire public enthusiasm. The great ladies of Bombay took up spinning. Hindu and Moslem women agreed to wear only national cloth, which became all the fashion. Tagore, too, praised this khaddar or khadi, as the hand-woven cloth was called, which he said was in excellent taste. Orders poured in. Some came from as far as Aden and Baluchistan.
U||But the disciples of Swadeshi went a little too far when they began boycotting foreign materials, and even Gandhi, usually sane and well balanced, was carried away. In August, 1921, he ordered the binning of all foreign goods in Bombay, and as in the days of Savonarola in Florence, Christo regnante, magnificent family heirlooms, priceless stuffs and materials, were piled into huge heaps and devoured by the flames in the midst of riotous cheers and enthusiasm. In this connection one of the most broad-minded Englishmen in India, C. F. Andrews, a great friend of Rabindranath Tagore, wrote a letter to Gandhi. While expressing his great admiration for the Mahatma, he deplored that such valuable materials should have been burned instead of having been given to the poor. He added that he believed the process of destruction called forth the worst instincts of the masses, and he protested against the outbursts of a nationalism which virtually set destruction up as a religious dogma. He could not help feeling that it 
U||was sinful to destroy the fruits of human toil. Andrews had approved Gandhi's campaign and had even begun wearing khaddar but now he wondered whether it was right to continue to do so. The burning cloth in Bombay had shaken his faith in the Mahatma.
U||In publishing Andrews's letter in "Young India" Gandhi said he regrets nothing. He does not bear ill will to any race whatsoever, nor does he demand the destruction of all foreign goods. He merely wants to destroy the goods which harm India. Millions of Indians have been ruined by English factories, which, by taking work away from India, have turned thousands upon thousands of Indians into pariahs and mercenaries and their women into prostitutes. India is already inclined to hate her British dominators. Gandhi does not wish to strengthen this hatred. On the contrary, he wants to side-track it, to turn it away from people to things. The Indians who bought the materials are as guilty as the British who sold them. The materials were not burned as an expression of hatred for England, but as a sign of India's determination to break with the past. It was a necessary surgical operation. And it would have been wrong to give these "poisonous" materials to the poor, for the poor too, have a sense of honor.
U||§ 3
U||India's economic life must first be freed from foreign domination. But the next step is to liberate the mind, create a real, independent Indian spirit. Gandhi wants his people to shake off the yoke of European culture, and one of his proudest achievements is the laying of the groundwork of a truly Indian education.
U||Under English rule the smoldering embers of Asiatic culture had lain dormant in various colleges and universities. For more than forty-five years Aligarh had remained a Hindu-Mussulman university, a center of Islamic culture in India. Khalsa College was the center of Sikh culture, while the Hindus had the University of Benares. But these institutions, more or less antiquated, were dependent on the Government, which subventioned them, and Gandhi longed to see them replaced by purer hearths of Asiatic culture. In November, 1920, he founded the national University of Gujarat at Ahmedabad. Its ideal was that of a united India. The Dharma of the Hindus and the Islam of the Mohammedans were its two religious pillars. Its object was to preserve the dialects of India and to use them as sources of national regeneration.[78] Gandhi felt, with full justice, that a "systematic study of Asiatic culture is no less essential than the study of Western sciences. The vast treasures of Sanskrit and Arabic, Persian and Pali and
U|| Magadhi, have to be ransacked to discover wherein lies the source of strength for the nation. The ideal is not merely to feed on or repeat the ancient cultures, but to build a new culture based on the traditions of the past and enriched by the experiences of later times. The ideal is a synthesis of the different cultures that have to come to stay in India, that have influenced Indian life, and that, in their turn, have themselves been influenced by the spirit of the soil. This synthesis will naturally be of the Swadeshi type, where each culture is assured its legitimate place, and not of the American pattern, where one dominant culture absorbs the rest and where the aim is not toward harmony, but toward an artificial and forced unity." All Indian religions were to be taught. The Hindus were to have an opportunity of studying the Koran and the Mussulmans the Shastras. The national university excludes nothing except a spirit of exclusion. It believes that there is nothing "untouchable" in humanity. Hindustani
U|| is made compulsory, because it is the national blend of Sanskrit, Hindi, and Persianized Urdu.[79] A spirit of independence was to be fostered, not only by the methods of study, but by a careful vocational training.
U||Gandhi hopes to organize, gradually, higher schools that will spread education broadcast throughout the towns and "filter it down to the masses, so that ... ere long the suicidal cleavage between the educated and the uneducated will be bridged. And as an effect of giving an industrial education to the genteel folks and a literary education to the industrial classes, the unequal distribution of wealth and social discontent will be considerably checked."
U||In opposition to European educational methods, which neglect manual proficiency and develop the brain only, Gandhi wants manual work to he part of the curriculum of all the schools from the lowest grades up. He believes it would be excellent for children to pay for their tuition by a certain amount of spinning. In this way they would learn to earn their living and become independent. As for education of the heart, which Europe neglects absolutely, Gandhi would have stress laid upon it from the very first. But before the pupils can be properly trained, the right sort of teachers must be provided.
U||The object of the higher institutions which Gandhi seems to look upon as the keystones of the new education is to train teachers. These institutions will be more than schools or colleges; they might rather be called convents, where the sacred fire of India will be concentrated in order afterward to radiate throughout the world, just as in former days great religious pioneers radiated from the Benedictine monasteries in the West, conquering souls and territory.
U||The rules which Gandhi prescribes for the school of Satyagrah Ashram,[80] or place of discipline, at Ahmedabad, his model institution, concern the teachers more than the pupils, and bind the former by monastic vows. Whereas these vows in ordinary religious orders have a purely negative character, here they throb with an active spirit of sacrifice and with the pure love that inspires the saints. The teachers are bound by the following vows:
U||1. The vow of truth. It is not enough not to resort ordinarily to untruth. No deception may be practised even for the good of the country. Truth may require opposition to parents and elders.
U||2. The vow of Ahimsa (non-killing). It is not enough not to take the life of any living being. One may not even hurt those whom he believes to be unjust; he may not be angry with them, he must love them. Oppose tyranny but never hurt the tyrant. Conquer him by love. Suffer punishment even unto death for disobeying his will.
U||3. The vow of celibacy. Without it the two foregoing are almost impossible to observe. It is not enough not to look upon woman with a lustful eye. Animal passions must be controlled, so that they will not be moved even in thought. If a man is married, he will consider his wife a lifelong friend and establish with her the relationship of perfect purity.
U||4. The control of the palate. Regulate and purify the diet. Leave off such foods as may tend to stimulate animal passions or are otherwise unnecessary.
U||5. The vow of non-stealing. It is not enough not to steal what is commonly considered other men's property. It is theft if we use articles which we do not really need. Nature provides us from day to day just enough and no more for our daily needs.
U||6. The vow of non-possession. It is not enough not to possess and not to keep much, but it is necessary not to keep anything which may not be absolutely necessary for our bodily wants. Think constantly of simplifying life.
U||To these main vows are added a few secondary rules:
U||1. Swadeshi. Use no articles about which there is a possibility of deception. Do not use manufactured articles. Laborers suffer much in mills, and manufactured articles are products of misery exploited. Foreign goods and goods made by complicated machinery should be tabooed by a votary of Ahimsa. Use simple clothes, made simply in India.
U||2. Fearlessness. He who is acted upon by fear cannot follow truth or Ahimsa. He must be free from the fear of kings, people, caste, families, thieves, robbers, ferocious animals, and death. A truly fearless man will defend himself against others by truth-force or soul-force.
U||Once established the main points of this iron foundation, Gandhi refers rapidly to the other requirements, of which the two most remarkable are that the teachers must set the example of performing bodily labor, preferably agricultural work, and that they must know the principal Indian tongues.
U||As for the pupils, who can enter the Ashram from the age of four up (students will be admitted at any age), they must remain in the Ashram for the whole course of studies, which lasts about ten years. The children are separated from their parents and families. The parents renounce all authority over them. The children never visit their parents. The pupils wear simple clothes, eat simple food of a strictly vegetarian nature, have no holidays in the ordinary sense of the word, though once a week they are allowed a day and a half in which to do individual creative work. Three months of the year are spent in traveling on foot through India. All pupils must study the Hindi and Dravidian dialects. As a second language, they must learn English, and they must also familiarize themselves with the characters of the five Indian languages (Urdu, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, and Davanagri). They are taught, in their own dialect, history, geography, mathematics, economics, and Sanskrit. At the same time they are taught agricul
U||ture and spinning and weaving. It goes without saying that a religious atmosphere pervades the whole education. When they have completed their studies, the pupils are allowed to choose between taking the vows, like their teachers, or leaving the school. The tuition is entirely free.
U||I have described Gandhi's educational system rather fully because it shows the high spirituality of his action, and because he considers this system the mainspring of the whole movement. To build a New India, a new soul, strong and pure, must be wrought out of Indian elements. And this soul can only be developed by a sacred legion of apostles who, like those of Christ, will be as the salt of the earth. Gandhi, unlike our European revolutionaries, is not a maker of laws and ordinances. He is a builder of a new humanity.
U||§ 4
U||Like all governments under similar conditions, the English Government had no realization of what was going on. At first its attitude was one of ironical disdain. The viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, characterized the movement in August, 1920, as "the most foolish of all foolish schemes." But these heights of comfortable condescension had to be abandoned before long. In November, 1920, the Government published a surprised and slightly alarmed proclamation, where threats and paternal advice commingled, warning the people that while the leaders of the movement had not been molested so far because they had not preached violence, orders had now been given to arrest any one who overstepped the bounds and whose words might stir up revolt or in other ways incite to violence.
U||The bounds were soon overstepped, but by the Government. The non-coöperation movement had been growing and gathering momentum, and the Government was beginning to be seriously alarmed. In December affairs took a decidedly dangerous turn. Until then non-violent non-coöperation had been looked upon as an experiment of a more or less temporary nature, and the Government had flattered itself that when the National Indian Congress met at Nagpur for its December session, non-coöperation would be vetoed. But far from disapproving of non-coöperation, the congress incorporated the idea in the constitution by making the first paragraph read:
U||    The object of the Indian National Congress is the attainment of Swaraj—Home Rule—by the people of India by all legitimate and peaceful means.
U||The congress thereupon confirmed the non-coöperation resolution passed in the special session in September, and enlarged upon it. While the principle of non-violence was upheld absolutely, the general feeling was that every effort must be made to unite all the elements in India in view of a common, sustained action, and the congress not only called upon Hindus and Mussulmans to collaborate loyally, but urged a rapprochement between the privileged and "suppressed" classes. In addition to this the congress made fundamental changes in the constitution, which virtually amounted to the organization of a representative system for all India.[81]
U||The congress did not try to conceal the fact that it regarded non-coöperation in its present form as a preliminary step only, to be followed, at a time to be determined later, by complete non-coöperation, including a refusal to pay taxes. Until then, however, and in order to pave the way, it urged that the boycott be sharpened, spinning and weaving be encouraged, while an appeal was sent out to students, parents, and magistrates inviting them to practise non-coöperation with greater zeal. Those who did not live up to the decisions of the congress were to be barred from public life.
U||The resolutions of the congress implied the virtual establishment of a state within a state, the setting up of real Indian rule in opposition to the British Government. England could not countenance this. She had to do something. The Government had to fight or negotiate. A compromise could easily have been reached by negotiation if the Government had been willing to go half-way. The congress had declared that it hoped to reach its goal "with England, if possible," but otherwise "without her." But as is always the case when European politics involve foreign races, no attempt was made to negotiate. Force was resorted to. Pretexts for armed oppression were sought. There was no lack of them.
U||Despite the principle of non-violence established by Gandhi and the congress, a few riots occurred in various parts of India. It is true that they bore little or no relation to the non-coöperative movement, but, still, there had been and were troubles. In the United Provinces (Allahabad) there were agrarian uprisings, revolts of the tenants against the landowners, and the police had to interfere, and there was some bloodshed. Soon afterward the Akali movement of the Sikhs, although of a purely religious character, adopted non-coöperative methods, and as a result of the agitation some two hundred Sikhs were massacred in February, 1921. No one in good faith could have held Gandhi or his disciples responsible for this drama of fanaticism, but the Government considered it a good opportunity. In March, 1921, the repression began, and it became more and more oppressive as the months passed. The Government justified its intervention by the necessity of protecting the liquor dealers from the fury of the mobs. This
U|| was not the first time for European civilization and alcohol to march hand in hand. The volunteer non-coöperation organizations were dissolved. A law was made prohibiting seditious meetings. In certain provinces the police had given carte blanche in suppressing the movement, which was called "revolutionary and anarchistic." Thousands of Indians were arrested, and some of India's most respected citizens were summarily jailed and brutalized. Naturally, this procedure stirred up bad blood, and here and there the people and the constables clashed. Some houses were burned and people pounded. This was the situation in India when the committee of the All-Indian congress met at Bezwada in the end of March to discuss civil disobedience. With rare moderation and foresight it voted against it, on the ground that the country was not yet prepared to wield this double-edged sword. Civil disobedience would be urged later. For the present there could only be a sort of civil and financial mobilization.
U||Meanwhile Gandhi continued more and more actively his campaign for the unity of India. He tried to unite all religions, races, parties, and castes. He called upon the Parsees,[82] the rich, prosperous merchant class, more or less tainted, as he expressed it, with the spirit of Rockefeller, and he called upon Hindus and Mussulmans to form a solid alliance. The relations between Hindus and Mussulmans were continually embittered by prejudices, mutual fear, and suspicion. Gandhi devoted himself to bringing the two races into harmonious collaboration,[83] and without advocating or desiring an impossible fusion between the two peoples, he tried to unite them in friendship.[84]
U||His keenest efforts, however, were given to the regeneration of the "suppressed" classes, the pariahs. His passionate appeals for the pariahs, his cries of sorrow and indignation at the monstrous social iniquity which oppressed them, would, alone, immortalize his name. His feeling for the outcasts dates back to his boyhood. He tells how, when he was a boy,[85] a pariah used to come to the house to do all the coarse work. As a boy Gandhi was told never to touch the pariah without purifying himself afterward by ablutions. He could not understand why, and often asked his parents about it. At school he frequently touched the untouchables, and his mother told him that he could escape the consequences of this unholy touch only by touching a Mohammedan. To Gandhi it all seemed absurdly unfair, cruelly unjustified. At the age of twelve he made up his mind to wipe this stain off India's conscience. He planned to come to the rescue of his degraded brothers. And never has Gandhi's mind revealed itself clearer and more 
U||unbiased than when he pleads their cause. What their cause means to him may be gathered from the fact that he says he would give up his religion (he to whom religion is everything!) if any one can prove to him that untouchability is one of its dogmas. The unjust pariah system justified, in his eyes, everything that has been inflicted on India by other nations.
U||    If the Indians have become the pariahs of the empire, it is retributive justice, meted out to us by a just God.... Should we Hindus not wash our blood-stained hands before we ask the English to wash theirs? Untouchability has degraded us, made us pariahs in South Africa, East Africa, Canada. So long as Hindus willfully regard untouchability as part of their religion, so long Swaraj is impossible of attainment. India is guilty, England has done nothing blacker. The first duty is to protect the weak and helpless and never injure the feelings of any individual. We are no better than brutes until we have purged ourselves of the sins we have committed against our weaker brethren.
U||Gandhi wanted the national congress to better the condition of the pariah brothers by giving them schools and wells, for pariahs were not allowed to use the public wells. But until then? Unable to wait with folded hands for the privileged classes to condescend to make good their cruelty, Gandhi went over to the pariahs. He placed himself at their head and tried to organize them. He discussed their problems with them. What ought they to do? Appeal to the English Government? Place themselves at its disposal? This would only mean a change of slavery. Abandon Hinduism? (Note the broad-minded audacity of a Hindu believer!) Become Christians or Mohammedans? Gandhi would almost advise them to do so if Hinduism really stood for untouchability. But it doesn't. Untouchability is only a morbid excrescence of Hinduism, which must be extirpated. The pariahs must organize themselves in self-defense. They might, of course, adopt the principles of non-coöperation in regard to Hinduism by refusing to have any relations with
U|| the Hindus (singularly audacious advice of social revolt on the lips of a patriot like Gandhi!). But the difficulty is that the pariahs have no leaders and cannot organize themselves. The best thing, therefore, is for them to join the general non-coöperation movement, since its object is harmony among all classes. Real non-coöperation is a religious act of purification, and no one can take part in it who believes in untouchability. Gandhi in this way combines religion, humanity, and patriotism.[86]
U||A certain solemnity attended the first efforts to group the pariahs. A "suppressed-classes conference" took place at Ahmedabad on April 13 and 14, 1921. Gandhi presided at the conference and made one of his most beautiful speeches. He not only demanded the suppression of the pariah system but urged the untouchables to rise to the occasion and show the best that was in them. He expects great things from the pariahs, he says, in the social life of regenerated India. He tries to instill self-confidence in them and fill them with his own burning ideal. In the "suppressed classes," he says, he sees tremendous latent possibilities. He believes that within five months the untouchable class will be able to win, by its own merits, the place it deserves within the great Indian family.
U||Gandhi had the joy of seeing his appeal find echo in the hearts of the people. In many parts of India the pariahs were emancipated.[87] The day before his arrest Gandhi made a speech recording the progress of the pariah cause. The Brahmans were helping. The privileged classes were giving touching examples of remorse and fraternal love. Gandhi cites the case of a young Brahman who at nineteen became a street-sweeper, to live among the untouchables.[88]
U||§ 5
U||With equal generosity Gandhi took up another great cause, that of women.
U||The sexual problem is a peculiarly difficult one in India, throbbing with an all-pervading, oppressive, and badly directed sensuality. Child marriages weaken the physical and moral resources of the nation. The obsession of the flesh weighs on men's minds and is an insult to woman's dignity. Gandhi publishes the complaints of Hindu women at the degrading attitude of Hindu nationalists.[89] Gandhi takes the women's side. Their protest, he says, proves that there is another sore in India as bad as that of untouchability. But the woman question is not a purely Indian problem. The whole world suffers from it. As with the pariahs, he expects more from the oppressed than from the oppressors. He calls upon women to demand and inspire respect by ceasing to think of themselves as the objects of masculine desire only. Let them forget their bodies and enter into public life, assume the risks, and suffer the consequences of their convictions. Women should not only renounce luxury and throw away or burn foreign goods, but
U|| they should share men's problems and privations. Many distinguished women have faced arrest and imprisonment in Calcutta. This shows the proper spirit. Instead of asking for mercy, women should vie with men in suffering for the cause. When it comes to suffering, women will always surpass men. Let women have no fear. The weakest will be able to preserve her honor. "One who knows how to die need never fear."
U||Nor does Gandhi forget the fallen sisters.[90] He tells of conversations with them in the provinces of Andhra and Barisal, where they met in conference. He spoke to them nobly and simply, and they replied, confided in him, and asked his advice. He tried to suggest some way in which they might make an honest living, and proposed spinning. They agreed to begin the very next day if assured of encouragement and assistance. And then Gandhi turned to the men of India; called upon them to respect women:
U||    Gambling in vice has no place in our revolution. Swaraj, home rule, means that we must regard every inhabitant of India as our own brother or sister. Woman is not the weaker sex, but the better half of humanity, the nobler of the two; for even to-day it is the embodiment of sacrifice, silent suffering, humility, faith, and knowledge. Woman's intuition has often proved truer than man's arrogant assumption of knowledge.
U||In the women of India, beginning with his own wife, Gandhi always found intelligent aid and understanding, and among them he recruited some of his best disciples.
U||§ 6
U||In 1921 Gandhi's power was at its apogee. His authority as a moral leader was vast, and without having sought it, almost ilimited political authority had been placed in his hand. The people looked upon him as a saint. Pictures were painted representing him as Sri-Krishna.[91] And at the end of the year, in December, the All-India National Congress delegated its powers to him and authorized him to appoint his successor. He was the undisputed master of India's policy. It was up to him to start a political revolution, if he saw fit, or even to reform religion.
U||He did not do so. He did not wish to do so. Moral grandeur? Moral hesitancy? Both, perhaps. It is very difficult for one human being really to understand another, particularly if they belong to different races and civilizations. And how much more difficult when a spirit so deep and subtle as Gandhi's is to be considered! In the maze of events which took place in India, in this tumultuous year, it is hard to ascertain whether the pilot's hand did not tremble, but, always firm and sure, steered the colossal ship along the chosen course. I will try, however, to explain my feeling in regard to the living enigma, and I will do so with the religious respect which I have for this great man and the sincerity which I owe to his sincerity.
U||If Gandhi's power was great, the danger of abusing it was equally great. As the effect of his campaign, by the slightest ripple, affected hundreds of millions of men, it became more and more difficult to direct the movement and at the same time remain firm in the midst of the turbulent ocean. A superhuman problem indeed, to conciliate moderation and high-mindedness with surging, unbridled mob passions! The pilot, gentle and pious, prays and relies on God; but the voice that comes to him is almost lost in the roar of the tempest. Will it ever reach the others?
U||There is no danger of his being swept off his feet by pride. No amount of adoration can turn his head. On the contrary, it wounds not only his sense of fitness of things, but his spirit of humility. Gandhi is an exception among prophets and mystics, for he sees no visions, has no revelations; he does not try to persuade himself that he is guided supernaturally, nor does he try to make others believe it. Radiant sincerity is his. His forehead remains calm and clear, his heart devoid of vanity. He is a man, like all other men. He is not a saint. He will not have the people call him one. (Yet his very attitude proves that he is one.)
U||The word "saint," he says, should be ruled out of present life.
U||    I pray like every good Hindu. I believe we can all be messengers of God. I have no special revelations of God's will. My firm belief is that He reveals himself daily to every human being, but that we shut our cars to the "still small voice." ... I claim to be nothing but a humble servant of India and humanity. I have no desire to found a sect. I am really too ambitious to be satisfied with a sect for a following, for I represent no new truths. I endeavor to follow and represent truth as I know it. I do claim to throw a new light on many an old truth.[92]
U||Personally, he is always modest, conscientious in the extreme, incapable of narrow-mindedness whether as Indian patriot or apostle of non-coöperation. He sanctions no tyranny, not even for the good of the cause. Government oppression must never be replaced by non-coöperative oppression.[93] Gandhi will not set his country up against other countries; his patriotism is not confined to the boundaries of India. "For me, patriotism is the same as humanity. I am patriotic because I am human and humane. My patriotism is not exclusive. I will not hurt England or Germany to serve India. Imperialism has no place in my scheme of life. A patriot is so much less a patriot if he is a lukewarm humanitarian."[94]
U||But have his disciples always felt this way? And, on their lips, what becomes of Gandhi's doctrine? And, interpreted by them, how does it reach the masses?
U||When Rabindranath Tagore, after traveling several years in Europe, returned to India in August, 1921, he was astounded at the change in the mentality of the people. Even before his return he had expressed his anxiety in a series of letters sent from Europe to friends in India. Many of these letters were published in his "Modern Review."[95] The controversy between Tagore and Gandhi, between two great minds, both moved by mutual admiration and esteem, but as fatally separated in their feeling as a philosopher can be from an apostle, a St. Paul from a Plato, is important. For on the one side we have the spirit of religious faith and charity seeking to found a new humanity. On the other we have intelligence, free-born, serene, and broad, seeking to unite aspirations of all humanity in sympathy and understanding.
U||Tagore always looked upon Gandhi as a saint, and I have often heard him speak of him with veneration. When, in referring to the Mahatma, I mentioned Tolstoi, Tagore pointed out to me, and I realize it now that I know Gandhi better—how much more clothed in light and radiance Gandhi's spirit is than Tolstoi's. With Gandhi everything is nature—modest, simple, pure—while all his struggles are hallowed by religious serenity, whereas with Tolstoi everything is proud revolt against pride, hatred against hatred, passion against passion. Everything in Tolstoi is violence, even his doctrine of non-violence. On April 10, 1921, Tagore wrote from London, "We are grateful to Gandhi for giving India a chance to prove that her faith in the divine spirit of man is still living." Despite the misgivings he had expressed as to Gandhi's campaign, Tagore, when he left France to return to India, sincerely planned to back Gandhi in every way. And even the manifesto of October, 1921, which I will discuss later—the "Appeal to
U|| Truth," which marked the break between the two men—begins with one of the most beautiful tributes to Gandhi that have ever been written.
U||Gandhi's attitude to Tagore is one of loving regard, and it does not change even when the two disagree. You feel that Gandhi is loath to enter into polemics with Tagore, and when certain kind friends try to embitter the debate by repeating personal remarks, Gandhi bids them be silent and explains how much he owes Tagore.[96]
U||Yet it was inevitable that the breach between the two men would widen. As far back as in 1920 Tagore had deplored that the overflowing wealth of Gandhi's love and faith should be made to serve political ends, as it had since Tilak's death. Of course Gandhi had not entered the political arena with a light heart. But when Tilak died, India was left without a political leader, and some one had to take his place.
U||As Gandhi says:[97]
U||    If I seem to take part in politics, it is only because politics to-day encircle us like the coils of a snake from which one cannot get out no matter how one tries. I wish to wrestle with the snake.... I am trying to introduce religion into politics.
U||But this Tagore deplores. Writing September 7, 1920, he says, "We need all the moral force which Mahatma Gandhi represents, and which he alone in the world can represent." That such a precious treasure should be cast out on the frail bark of politics and subjected to the incessant lashing of the waves of conflicting and irritated passions is a serious misfortune for India, whose mission, says Tagore, "is to awaken the dead to life by soul-fire." The wasting of spiritual resources in problems which, when considered in the light of abstract moral truth, are unworthy, is to be regretted. "It is criminal to transform moral force into force."
U||This is what Tagore felt at the spectacular launching of the non-coöperation campaign and at the unrest stirred up in the name of the Khilafat cause and the massacres of the Punjab. He feared the results of the campaign on an easily excitable mob subject to attacks of hysterical fury. He would have liked to turn people's minds away from vengeance and dreams of impossible redress; he would have had them forget the irreparable and devote all efforts to constructing and fashioning a new soul for India. And although he admired Gandhi's doctrines and the ardent fire of his spirit of self-sacrifice, he hated the element of negation contained in non-coöperation. Tagore instinctively recoiled from everything that stood for "No."
U||And this conviction leads him to compare the positive ideal of Brahmanism, which demands that the joys of life be welcomed but purified, to the negative ideal of Buddhism, which demands their suppression.[98] To this Gandhi replies that the art of eliminating is as vital as that of accepting.[99] Human progress consists in a combination of the two. The final word in the Upanishads is a negation. The definition of Brahman by the authors of the Upanishads is neti, not this! India had lost the power of saying "No." Gandhi has given it back to her. Weeding is as essential as sowing.
U||But Tagore, apparently, does not believe in weeding. In his poetic contemplation of life he is satisfied with things as they are, and he finds his delight in admiring their harmony. He explains his point of view in lines of great beauty, but detached from real life. His words are like the dance of Nataraja, a play of illusions. Tagore says he tries to tune his spirit up to the great exaltation that is sweeping over the country. But he cannot do so, for in his heart, despite himself, is a spirit of resistance. "In the darkness of my despair," he says, "I see a smile and hear a voice that says, 'Your place is with the children, playing on the beaches of the world, and there I am with you.'" Tagore plays with harmonies, invents new rhythms, "strung out through the hours, like children dancing in the sun and laughing as they disappear." All creation is happy, with Tagore; flowers and leaves are merely rhythms that never cease. God Himself is the supreme juggler, who plays with Time, tossing stars and planets out
U|| upon the torrent of appearances, and dropping paper boats filled with dreams into the river of the ages. "When I beg Him to let me be His disciple and to let me place some of the toys of my invention into one of his merry barks. He smiles, and I follow Him, clutching the hem of his gown." Here Tagore feels he is in his place. "But where am I, in a great crowd, squeezed in at all sides? And who can understand the noise I hear? If I hear a song, my sitar can catch the melody, and I can join the chorus, for I am a singer. But in the mad clamor of the crowd, my voice is lost, and I become dizzy." Tagore has tried, in the clamor of non-coöperation, to find a melody, but to no avail. And he says to himself: "If you can't march in step with your compatriots in the greatest crisis of their history, beware of saying they are in the wrong, and you in the right! But give up your place in the ranks, go back to your poet's corner, and be prepared to meet with ridicule and public disgrace."[100]
U||So would a Goethe speak, an Indian Goethe, Bacchus. And it would seem as if Tagore's mind is made up from now on. The poet bids action farewell, since this action implies a negation, and he withdraws back into the spell of creative enchantment he weaves around himself. But Tagore does not only withdraw. As he says, Fate had decided that he should steer his bark against the current. At the time he was not only the "poet" but the spiritual ambassador of Asia to Europe; he had just returned from Europe, where he had asked people to coöperate in creating a world university at Santiniketan. What an irony of destiny that he should be preaching cooperation between Occident and Orient at one end of the world, when at that very moment non-coöperation was being preached at the other end![101]
U||Non-coöperation wounded him doubly, therefore, in his work as well as in his conception of life. "I believe," he says, "in the real union of Orient and Occident."
U||Non-coöperation clashed with his way of thinking, for his mentality, his rich intelligence, had been nourished on all the cultures of the world. "All humanity's greatest is mine," he says. "The infinite personality of man (as the Upanishads say) can only come from the magnificent harmony of all human races. My prayer is that India may represent the coöperation of all the peoples of the world. For India, unity is truth, and division evil. Unity is that which embraces and understands everything; consequently, it cannot be attained through negation. The present attempt to separate our spirit from that of the Occident is an attempt at spiritual suicide.... The present age has been dominated by the Occident, because the Occident had a mission to fulfill. We of the Orient should learn from the Occident. It is regrettable, of course, that we had lost the power of appreciating our own culture, and therefore did not know how to assign Western culture to its right place. But to say that it is wrong to coöperate wit
U||h the West is to encourage the worst form of provincialism and can produce nothing but intellectual indigence. The problem is a world problem. No nation can find its own salvation by breaking away from others. We must all be saved or we must all perish together."[102]
U||In other words, just as Goethe in 1818 refused to reject French civilization and culture, Tagore refuses to banish Western civilization. While Gandhi's doctrine does not really set a barrier up between the East and West, Tagore knows it will be interpreted as doing so, once Hindu nationalism is stirred. Tagore fears the development of the spirit of exclusion, and he explains his feeling of doubt and anxiety when his students at the beginning of the non-cooperation movement came to seek his advice. What does the boycotting of schools and colleges mean? asks Tagore. "That students shall make a sacrifice—for what? Not for a more complete education, but for non-education." During the first Swadeshi campaign[103] a group of young students told him that they would leave their schools and colleges at once if he ordered them to do so. And when he refused to do so, they left him, in much irritation, doubting his patriotism.[104]
U||In the spring of 1921, when India began boycotting English schools, Tagore had seen an aggressive example of intellectual nationalism in London. During a lecture of one of Tagore's friends. Professor Pearson, some Indian students gave vent to misplaced national manifestations. Tagore became indignant, and in a letter addressed to the director of Santiniketan he condemned this spirit of intolerance and held the non-coöperation movement responsible for it. And to this accusation Gandhi replies:
U||    I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible.... But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any of them ... Mine is not a religion of the prison-house. It has room for the least among God's creations. But it is proof against insolent pride of race, religion, or color.
U||While expressing his doubts as to the merits of an English literary education, which has nothing to do with the building up of character, an education which, he said, has emasculated the youth of India, Gandhi regretted the excesses mentioned and claimed that his attitude was not narrow, as Tagore seemed to imply.
U||These were frank and noble words, but they did not disarm Tagore's misgivings. Tagore did not doubt Gandhi, but he feared the Gandhists. And from the first contact with his people, after his return from Europe, he began to fear the blind faith which the people placed in the Mahatma's words. Tagore saw the danger of mental despotism loom near, and in the "Modern Review" of October, 1921, he published a real manifesto, "An Appeal to Truth," which was a cry of revolt against this blind obedience. The protest was particularly strong because it was preceded by a beautiful homage to the Mahatma. After describing the first Indian independence movement in 1907 and 1908, Tagore explained that in those days the political leaders were inspired by a bookish ideal, based on the traditions of Burke, Gladstone, Mazzini, and Garibaldi, and their message could be understood only by the elite. They advanced, in short, an English-speaking ideal. But then came Mahatma Gandhi! He stopped at the thresholds of the thousands of dis
U||inherited, dressed like one of their own. He spoke to them in their own language. Here was truth at last, and not only quotations from books! Mahatma, the name given by the people of India to Gandhi, is his real name. For who else had felt, like him, in communion with the people? Felt that they are of his own flesh and blood? At the Mahatma's call the hidden forces of the soul have blossomed forth, for the Mahatma has made the truth into something concrete, visible. In the same way, thousands of years ago, India blossomed forth to new greatness at Buddha's call, when he made men understand that there must be compassion and fellow-feeling among all living creatures. India, stirred to new life, expressed her strength in science and wealth, spreading across oceans and deserts. No commercial or military conquests ever spread so magnificently. For love alone is truth.
U||But then Tagore's tone changed. The apotheosis stopped. Deception followed. In Europe, across the seas, Tagore felt the quiver of India's great revival. Thrilled, filled with joy at the thought of breathing in the fluid breeze of the new freedom, he returned to his home land. But on his arrival his elation fell. An oppressive atmosphere weighed on the people. "An outside influence seemed to be bearing down on them, grinding them and making one and all speak in the same tone, follow in the same groove. Everywhere I was told that culture and reasoning power should abdicate, and blind obedience only reign. So simple it is to crush, in the name of some outward liberty, the real freedom of the soul!"
U||We understand Tagore's misgivings and his appeal. They are of all times and ages. The last free minds of a crumbling old world voiced them at the dawn of the new Christianity. And whenever we ourselves encounter the rising tide of some blind faith in a social or national ideal we feel the same misgivings stir within us. Tagore's revolt is the revolt of the free soul against the ages of faith which it has suscitated, for while faith to a handful of chosen ones means supreme liberty, it means only another form of slavery for the masses who are led by it.
U||Tagore's criticism is aimed above and beyond the fanaticism of the crowd. Over the blind masses it strikes the Mahatma. No matter how great Gandhi may be, isn't he taking upon himself more than a single man can bear? A cause as great as India's should not be dependent on the will of a single master. The Mahatma is the master of truth and love, but the attainment of Swaraj home rule, is vastly complicated. "The paths are intricate and hard to explore. Emotion and enthusiasm are required, but also science and meditation. All the moral forces of the nation must be called upon. Economists must find practical solutions, educators must teach, statesmen ponder, workers work.... Everywhere the desire to learn must be kept up free and unhampered. No pressure, either open or hidden, must weigh on the intelligence." ... "In older days, in our primeval forests," says Tagore, "our sages, gurus, in the plenitude of their vision, called on all seekers of truth.... Why does not our guru, who wants to lead us to action, make
U|| the same call?" But the only command that Guru Gandhi so far has launched is, "Spin and weave!" And Tagore asks, "Is this the gospel of a new creative age? If large machinery constitutes a danger for the West, will not small machines constitute a greater danger for us?" The forces of a nation must cooperate, not only with each other, but with other nations. "The awakening of India is bound up in the awakening of the world. Every nation that tries to shut itself in violates the spirit of the new age." And Tagore, who has spent several years in Europe, speaks of some of the men he met—men who have freed their hearts from the chains of nationalism in order to serve humanity—men who constitute the persecuted minority of world citizens, cives totius orbis—and he classes them among the sannyasins, that is, "those who in their soul have realized human unity."[105]
U||And should India alone, asks Tagore, recite the chapter of negation, dwell eternally on the faults of others, and strive for Swaraj on a basis of hatred? When the bird is awakened by the dawn, it does not only think of food. Its wings respond to the call of the sky. Its throat fills with joyous songs to greet the coming day. A new humanity has sent out its call. Let India reply in her own way! "Our first duty, at dawn, is to remember Him Who is One, who is indistinguishable through class or color, and who, by his varied forces, provides, as is necessary, for the needs of each class and of all. Let us pray Him, who gives wisdom, to unite us all in understanding."[106]
U||Tagore's noble words, some of the most beautiful ever addressed to a nation, are a poem of sunlight, and plane above all human struggles. And the only criticism one can make of them is that they plane too high. Tagore is right, from the point of view of eternity. The bird-poet, the eagle-sized lark, as Heine called a master of our music, sits and sings on the ruins of time. He lives in eternity. But the demands of the present are imperious. The hour that passes demands immediate, if imperfect, relief; but clamors for it. And in this respect Gandhi, who lacks Tagore's poetic flight (or who, perhaps, as a Boddhisattva of pity has given it up in order to live among the disinherited) finds it child's play to reply.
U||In his answer to Tagore Gandhi displays more passion than he has so far shown in the controversy. On October 13, 1921, in "Young India," his stirring rejoinder appears. Gandhi thanks the "Great Sentinel"[107] for having warned India as to the pitfalls ahead. He agrees with Tagore that most essential of all is the maintenance of a free spirit.
U||    We must not surrender our reason into anybody's keeping. Blind surrender to love is often more mischievous than forced surrender to the lash of the tyrant. There is hope for the slave of the brute, none for that of love.
U||Tagore is the sentinel who warns of the approach of the enemies called Bigotry, Lethargy, Intolerance, Ignorance, and Inertia. But Gandhi does not feel that Tagore's misgivings are justified. The Mahatma always appeals to reason. It is not true that India is moved by blind obedience only. If the country decided to adopt the spinning-wheel, this has been only after considerable reflection. Tagore speaks of patience and is satisfied with beautiful songs. But there is war. Let the poet lay down his lyre! Let him sing when it is over! When a house is on fire, all must go out and take up a bucket to quench the fire.
U||When all about me are dying for want of food, the only occupation permissible for me is to feed the hungry. India is a house on fire. It is dying of hunger because it has no work to buy food with. Khulna is starving. The Ceded Districts are passing successively through a fourth famine. Orissa is a land suffering from chronic famine. India is growing daily poorer. The circulation about her feet and legs has almost stopped. And if we do not take care she will collapse altogether....
U||To a people famishing and idle the only acceptable form in which God can dare appear is work and promise of food as wages. God created man to work for his food and said that those who ate without work were thieves. We must think of millions who to-day are less than animals, almost in a dying state. Hunger is the argument that is drawing India to the spinning-wheel.
U||The poet lives for the morrow, and would have us do likewise. He presents to our admiring gaze the beautiful picture of the birds in the early morning singing hymns of praise as they soar into the sky. Those birds had their day's food and soared with rested wings in whose veins new blood had flown the previous night. But I have had the pain of watching birds who for want of strength could not be coaxed even into a flutter of their wings. The human bird under the Indian sky gets up weaker than when he pretended to retire. For millions it is an eternal vigil or an eternal trance. I have found it impossible to soothe suffering patients with a song from Kabir....
U||Give them work that they may eat! "Why should I, who have no need to work for food, spin?" may be the question asked. Because I am eating what does not belong to me. I am living on the spoliation of my countrymen. Trace the course of every coin that finds its way into your pocket, and you will realize the truth of what I write. Every one must spin. Let Tagore spin, like the others. Let him burn his foreign clothes; that is the duty to-day. God will take care of the morrow. As it says in the Gitâ, Do right!
U||Dark and tragic words these! Here we have the misery of the world rising up before the dream of art and crying, "Dare deny me existence!" Who does not sympathize with Gandhi's passionate emotion and share it?
U||And yet, in his reply so proud and so poignant, there is nevertheless something that justifies Tagore's misgivings: sileat poeta, imposing silence on the person who is called upon to obey the imperious discipline of the cause. Obey without discussion the law of Swadeshi, the first command of which is, Spin!
U||No doubt, in the human battle, discipline is a duty. But, unfortunately, those who are intrusted with enforcing this discipline, the master's lieutenants, may be narrow-minded men. They may mistake the discipline chosen to attain the ideal for the ideal itself. Discipline fascinates them by its rigidity, for they are of the kind who feel at ease only on the narrow path. They look upon Swadeshi as essential, not as a means to an end, but in itself. In their eyes it acquires an almost sacred character. One of Gandhi's disciples, professor at the school that lies nearest his heart, the Satyagraha Ashram of Sarbarmati at Ahmedabad, Mr. D. B. Kalelkar, writes a "Gospel of Swadeshi," which Gandhi, in a preface, stamps with his approval.[108] This book, or pamphlet, is addressed to the man in the street. Let us examine the creed as it is taught by one of those who drink at the very source of the unpolluted doctrine:
U||    Now and then God is incarnated on earth to redeem the world. His incarnation need not necessarily be in human form.... He may be manifest in an abstract principle or in an ideal which uplifts the world.... His latest incarnation is in the "Gospel of Swadeshi"...
U||The apostle realizes that this statement may cause a smile if Swadeshi is to be interpreted as meaning the boycott of foreign goods only. This is only a partial application of Swadeshi, which is a "vast religious principle that will rid the world of strife and hatred and liberate humanity." Its quintessence may be found in the Indian scriptures:
U||    Your own religious Dharma—that is to say, your own religious destiny or salvation—though imperfect, is the best. The fulfilment of Dharma for which you were not intended is always fraught with danger. He alone attains happiness who fulfils the task laid out for him.
U||The fundamental law of Swadeshi springs from faith in God, "who has provided, in all eternity, for the happiness of the world. This God has placed each human being in the environment best suited for the fulfilment of his task. A man's work and his aspirations should be suited to his position in the world. We cannot choose our culture any more than our birth, family, or country. We must accept what God has given us; we must accept tradition as coming from God and regard it as a strict duty to live up to it. To renounce tradition would be sinful."
U||From these premises it follows that the inhabitant of one country should not concern himself with other countries.
U||    The follower of Swadeshi never takes upon himself the vain task of trying to reform the world, for he believes that the world is moved and always will be moved according to rules set by God.... One must not expect the people of one country to provide for the needs of another, even for philanthropic reasons, and if it were possible, it would not be desirable.... The true follower of Swadeshi does not forget that every human being is his brother, but that it is incumbent on him to fulfil the task his particular environment has laid down for him. Just as we must work out our salvation in the century in which we are born, we should serve the country in which we are born. The emancipation of our soul should be sought through religion and our own culture.
U||Is it, however, permissible for a nation to take advantage of all opportunities to develop its resources of commerce and industry? Indeed not. An unworthy ambition to wish to develop India's manufactures! It would be asking people to violate their Dharmas! It is as criminal to export one's products as to import those of others. "For proselytism is repellent to the spirit of Swadeshi." And the logical conclusion of this theory, rather startling to a European, is that it is as sinful to export goods as ideas. If India has been bitterly humiliated in history, it is as punishment for the crimes of ancestors who traded with ancient Egypt and Rome, a crime deliberately repeated by all succeeding generations. Every nation, every class, should remain true to its own duty, live on its own resources, and be inspired by its own traditions.
U||    We should avoid being intimate with those whose social customs are different from ours. We should not mingle in the lives of men or peoples whose ideals are different from ours.... Every man is a brook. Every nation is a river. They must follow their course, clear and pure, till they reach the Sea of Salvation, where all will blend.
U||What is this but the triumph of nationalism? The narrowest and most unpolluted? Stay at home, shut all doors, change nothing, hold on to everything, export nothing, buy nothing, uplift and purify body and spirit! A gospel, indeed, of medieval monks![109] And Gandhi, of the broad mind, lets his name be associated with it!
U||Tagore's bewilderment, when met with these visionaries of reactionary nationalism, is comprehensible. No wonder he was taken back by these apostles, who would reverse the march of centuries, shut the free soul in a cage, and burn all bridges communicating with the West.[110] As a matter of fact, Gandhi's doctrine really implies nothing of the sort. As may be seen from his reply to Tagore, he says, "Swadeshi is a message to the world." The world exists; therefore, Gandhi reckons with it, and does not repudiate "proselyting. Non-coöperation," he says, "is not directed against the English or the West. Our non-coöperation is directed against material civilization and its attendant greed and exploitation of the weak." In other words, it combats the errors of the West and would therefore be beneficial to the West also. "Our non-coöperation is a retirement within ourselves." A temporary retirement to enable India to gather up her forces before placing them at the services of humanity. "India must learn to live b
U||efore she can aspire to die for humanity." Gandhi does not forbid coöperation with Europe provided the sound ideal which he sets up for all men is adhered to.
U||Gandhi's real doctrine is much broader, much more human, much more universal[111] than that expressed in the "Gospel" which he has approved. Why did Gandhi lend his name to this "Gospel"? Why does he let his magnificent ideal, a message for the whole world, be imprisoned within the narrow bonds of an Indian theocracy? Beware of disciples! The purer they are, the more pernicious. God preserve a great man from friends who only grasp part of his ideal! In codifying it, they destroy the harmony which is the real blessing of his living soul.
U||But this is not all. While the disciples who live near the master are at least tinged by his noble spirituality, what about the disciples of his disciples, and the others, the masses to whom the doctrine comes merely as vague and broken echoes? How much and what do they absorb of the gospel of spiritual purification and creative renouncement? Unfortunately, to them the doctrine appears in its most rudimentary and material form, in a sort of Messianic waiting for the advent of Swaraj, home rule, by the spinning-wheel! This is the negation of all progress. It's the old fuori Barbari. Tagore is alarmed, and not without reason, at the violence of the apostles of non-violence, and even Gandhi is not absolutely free from it. Gandhi says that he would "withdraw from the field if he felt hatred for the English," for one must love one's enemies while hating their deeds, "hate Satanism while loving Satan." The distinction, however, is a little too subtle for the average man to grasp. And when at each session of the co
U||ngress the leaders dwell with fiery eloquence on the crimes and treachery of the English, anger and rancor pile up behind the sluices; and beware when the sluices burst! When Gandhi, explaining why he advocates the burning of precious stuffs in Bombay in August, 1921, says to Andrews, Tagore's friend, that "He is transferring ill will from men to things,"[112] he does not realize that the fury of the masses is gathering impetus, and that instinctively these masses reason, "Things first, men next!" He does not foresee that in this same Bombay, less than three months afterward, men will be killing men. Gandhi is too much of a saint; he is too pure, top free from the animal passions that lie dormant in man. He does not dream that they lie there, crouching within the people, devouring his words and thriving on them. Tagore, more clear-sighted, realizes the danger the non-coöperators are skirting when they innocently lay bare the crimes of Europe, profess non-violence, and simultaneously plant in people's minds 
U||the virus which will inevitably break in violence! But this they do not realize, these apostles whose hearts are free from hatred. But he who would lead men in action must know the heart-beats of the others, not merely his own. Beware the mob! Cave canem! The moral precepts of a Gandhi will not be able to curb it. The only way, perhaps, to prevent it from running wild, the only way, perhaps, of making it yield docilely to the austere discipline of the master, would be for him to pose as an incarnated god, as those who paint him as Sri-Krishna secretly hope he will do. But Gandhi's sincerity and his humility prevent him from playing the role.
U||And then, planing above the roaring human ocean alone, remains the single voice of the purest of men, but only a man. How long will it be heard? Grandiose and tragic waiting!
U||[67]Etymologically, swa, self, oneself; deshi, country. Hence, national independence. The non-coöperators usually interpret it in the narrower sense of economic independence. It will be seen, further on, the sort of social gospel which Gandhi's followers make out of the idea. ("Gospel of Swadeshi.")

U||[75]Gandhi himself realizes that many will jeer. But, he asks, did the sewing-machine do away with the needle? The spinning-wheel's utility has not been lost. On the contrary, nothing is more useful at the present moment. Spinning is a national necessity, and constitutes the only possible means of subsistence for millions of starving people.

U||The new constitution provided that a delegate should be chosen for every 5000 inhabitants, which would make a total of 6175 delegates. The National Indian Congress was to meet once a year, round Christmas. The committee of the congress consisting of 850 members would act as executive body, enforcing the resolutions of the congress and carrying out its policies. Between the sessions of the congress the committee was to have the same authority as the congress. Within the committee an executive board of fifteen members was to bear the same relation to the congress committee that a ministerial cabinet bears to parliament. This board could be dissolved by the congress committee.
U||The Congress of Nagpur drew up the plans for a hierarchy of committees of provincial congresses, representing twenty-one provinces and twelve languages, and placed under them local committees in each village or group of villages.

U||Gandhi would not give his daughter in marriage to one of Ali's sons, nor would he share the meals of his friend; and the same is true of Maulana Mohamed Ali. But this does not prevent both men from being fond of each other, respecting each other, and relying on each other.
U||Gandhi does not say that intermarriage between Hindus and Mussulmans, and the fact of eating together, should necessarily be condemned, but he says they are impossible at the present time. It will take at least a century for the two peoples to reach such a stage of fusion. A policy purported practical should not attempt to carry such a reform. Gandhi does not object to it but considers it premature. The only important thing, for the present, is for the two peoples to respect each other and remain loyal to each other. Here, too, Gandhi shows his sense of realities. (October 20, 1921.)

U||[110]Tagore was particularly sensitive to such writings since there had sprung up a sort of rivalry between Gandhi's Ashram (where this "Gospel" was written) and Tagore's Santiniketan, a rivalry which both men tried to smooth out. In an article published February 9, 1922, Gandhi, in "Young India," complains that a journalist misquoted him, making him say things about his Ashram which might be construed as criticisms of Tagore's Santiniketan. Gandhi expresses his respect for Tagore's school and adds, rather humorously, that if he had to determine the superiority of one school over the other, he would vote for Santiniketan, in spite of the discipline of Ashram. Santiniketan is the older brother, older in age as well as in wisdom, but, says Gandhi, "Let the disciples of Santiniketan beware the growth of little Ashram!
U||[111]To my mind Gandhi is as universal as Tagore, but in a different way. Gandhi is a universalist through his religious feeling; Tagore is intellectually universal. Gandhi does not exclude any one from the communion of prayer and daily duties, just as the first apostles did not differentiate between Jews and Gentiles but imposed the same moral discipline on both. This is what Gandhi aspires to do, and herein lies his narrowness; not in his heart, which is as large as that of a Christ, but in his spirit of intellectual asceticism and renunciation. (And this, too, is of a Christ!) Gandhi is a universalist of the Middle Ages. While venerating him, we understand and approve Tagore.
U||[112]September 1, 1921.
U||PART THREE
U||§ 1
U||In 1921 the non-coöperation movement evolved rapidly. The whole year was one of uncertainty, expectancy, and violent outbreaks. Gandhi inevitably reflected its oscillations.
U||For a long time hostility had been growing, and it broke out in open revolt at the Government's brutally oppressive measures. There were riots at Malegaon, in the district of Nasik, and at Giridih, in Behar. In the beginning of May, 1921, there were serious clashes in Assam. Twelve thousand coolies stopped work in the tea-gardens, and were attacked by Gurkhas drafted by the Government, and in eastern Bengal the railroad and steamship workers organized a two months' strike in protest. Gandhi did all in his power to calm the effervescence. In May he had a long conversation with the viceroy, Lord Reading, and he also used his influence with the Ali brothers, who were said to be stirring up violence by their inflammatory speeches. Gandhi was able to persuade his Moslem friends to "refrain from directly or indirectly advocating violence."
U||The non-coöperation movement, however, grew more and more powerful as time went on. The Moslem element in particular became audacious. At Karachi, July 8, for instance, the All-India Khilafat Conference, after reiterating the Moslem claims, declared that no Mussulman should serve in the English Army or assist in recruiting. In fact, the conference even went so far as to threaten to proclaim a republic in India and advocate civil disobedience at the December session of the National Congress if the Government did not change its hostile attitude to the Angora leaders. A little later, on July 28, the committee of the National Congress (the first congress committee elected according to the new constitution) sitting at Bombay decided to boycott the Prince of Wales, whose visit was announced, and declared a boycott on all foreign materials, to become effective before September 30. It also took steps to intensify and regulate national spinning and weaving, and urged the organization of a more vigorous campaign agai
U||nst the drink evil, despite the Government's support of the dealers. Less audacious than the Mussulmans of the Khilafat Conference, however, the congress committee disavowed revolutionary tendencies and disapproved civil disobedience, approving a more; strenuous propaganda in favor of non-violence.
U||In August a brutal revolt of the Moplahs took place, and lasted several months. With Maulana Mohamed Ali, Gandhi decided to go from Calcutta to Malabar to try to quiet it. But the Government arrested Maulana Mohamed and his brother Maulana Shaukat Ali as well as several other Moslem notables, accusing them of having voted for civil disobedience at the Khilafat Conference. At the news of the Ali brothers' arrest, the Central Khilafat Committee, sitting at Delhi, ratified unanimously the resolutions of the Khilafat Conference. Hundreds of demonstrations, held all over India, confirmed the people's approval of them. On October 4, Gandhi announced that he considered his cause hound up with that of the Mussulmans. In a manifesto approved by fifty prominent members of the All-India Congress Gandhi declared that every citizen was entitled to express his views on non-coöperation, adding that no Indian, whether civil functionary or soldier, should serve a Government which has brought about the moral, political, and 
U||economical degradation of India. He set up non-coöperation with such a Government as an imperative duty. The Ali brothers' trial took place at Karachi. With their fellow-accused, they were sentenced to two years' imprisonment.
U||To this sentence India replied with redoubled vigor. Gandhi's manifesto was ratified by the Committee of the All-India Congress on November 4 at Delhi. And casting the die, the committee authorized every province, on its own responsibility, to proclaim civil disobedience, beginning with a refusal to pay taxes. "Resisters," however, were first to swear complete obedience to the Swadeshi program, including hand spinning, and take the vow of non-violence. In other words, under Gandhi's direction the committee tried to combine resistance against the Government with discipline and self-sacrifice. To make the disinterested character of the movement clear. Resisters were informed that neither they nor their families would receive any pecuniary aid from the committee.
U||The great disobedience was about to become effective when, on November 17, the Prince of Wales landed at Bombay. The boycott was carried out by the lower and the middle classes; but the rich, the Parsees and official personages, ignored the order completely. Their attitude created such fury among the populace that the masses stormed the houses of the rich, looting and sacking homes and property, sparing no one, not even the women. Many were killed and wounded. This was the only case of violence, however. Everywhere else, all over India, the prescribed hartal took place in the midst of almost religious quiet and order. There were no disturbances of any kind. But the news of the Bombay riots wounded Gandhi "like an arrow shot in his heart." As soon as he heard of them he rushed to the spot, and when the rioters cheered him his mortification knew no bounds. He called the crowd angrily to order and commanded it to disperse. He declared that the Parsees were justified in celebrating the prince's arrival if they w
U||ished, and, in any event, nothing justified violence. The crowd listened to Gandhi in silence, but farther off the tumult broke out again. The worst elements seemed to have suddenly emerged from the earth, and twenty thousand men, towering in rage and hatred, cannot be brought back to reason all at once. Still, the rioters remained localized in certain districts, and the destruction was not half so great as that caused by the most insignificant revolutionary outbreak in Europe. Gandhi, however, issued anguished appeals to the citizens of Bombay and to the non-coöperators, and declared that such incidents proved that the masses were not yet ripe for civil disobedience. Therefore he suspended the order proclaiming it. To punish himself for the violence of his followers, he imposed upon himself a religious fast of twenty-four hours every week.
U||The European residents in India were less alarmed by the Bombay riots than by the striking unanimousness of the silent hartal throughout the country. They urged the viceroy and the Government to act, and a series of oppressive measures were imposed in the various provinces. An old law, aimed at anarchists and secret societies, dating from the uprisings of 1908, was unearthed, and made to serve against the volunteer associations of the Congress and of the Khilafat. Arrests were made by the thousand, which only resulted in bringing thousands of new recruits to register as volunteers, who were then trained by the provincial committees. In the meantime a hartal was set for December 24, the date of the Prince of Wales's visit to Calcutta. That day the prince passed through a silent, absolutely deserted city.
U||The revolution seemed to be smoldering everywhere, ready to burst into flame when the Indian National Congress met at Ahmedabad. There was about it the impressive solemnity of the États-Généraux on the eve of the French Revolution in 1789. The president of the congress had just been imprisoned. The discussions were brief. The congress again proclaimed its faith in non-coöperation and invited all citizens to register as volunteers and to be prepared to face arrest. It also urged the people to organize mass-meetings everywhere; and after expressing the opinion that civil disobedience is a weapon equally effective and more humane than armed rebellion, it moved that civil disobedience be adopted as soon as the masses had grasped the real spirit of non-violence. Realizing that many of the members would be arrested at the close of the session, the congress delegated its powers to Gandhi, investing him with a dictature de facto and authorizing him to appoint his successor. This made Gandhi sole master of India'
U||s policy. The congress limited his authority on one point only, and this was that he should agree to no change in the national creed nor make peace with the Government without the consent of the congress committee. A fraction of the assembly tried to pass a resolution approving violence, if necessary to bring about India's independence, but this resolution was rejected by the majority, which believed in Gandhi's principles.
U||The ensuing weeks revealed the religious enthusiasm which swept over India. Twenty-five thousand men and women joyfully surrendered themselves to prison guards. And back of them, thousands of others stood ready to give themselves up to prove their faith in the cause of India.
U||§ 2
U||Again Gandhi believed the country was ripe for civil disobedience en masse. The signal was to be given in a model district, at Bardoli, in the province of Bombay.[113] Here Gandhi's ideas had always been understood and followed. In an open letter to the viceroy, dated February 9, 1922, Gandhi set forth his program. The letter is a courteous, but clear, declaration of war. Gandhi says he is the leader of the non-coöperation movement, and he claims responsibility for it. Bardoli will be the first unit of non-violent mass revolt against a government which has brutally infringed upon freedom of the press, of association, and of speech. Gandhi gives Lord Reading seven days in which to announce a change of policy. If the "viceroy will not or cannot see such an incredibly simple issue," civil disobedience will be proclaimed.[114]
U||Scarcely had the letter, to the viceroy been despatched when there occurred an outbreak more violent than any of the others. During a procession at Chauri-Chaura, in the district of Gorakhpur, or, rather, after the procession had passed, some stragglers were "interfered with and abused by the constables." Attacked by the mob, the constables opened fire, and when they exhausted their ammunition they retired to the thana (the police barracks) for safety. The mob set fire to the thana. In vain the besieged begged for mercy. They were pitilessly massacred and burned. As the provocation had come from them, however, and as no non-coöperation volunteer had had a hand in the attack, Gandhi would have been justified in disclaiming all responsibility for the outrage. But he had really become the conscience of India. The crime of a single one of his people cut him to the quick. He took upon himself all the sins of his people. His horror was such that on the spur of the moment, and for the second time, he stopped the c
U||ivil-disobedience movement that he had just launched. The situation was vastly more complicated than after the Bombay riots, and only a few days before he had sent his ultimatum to the viceroy. How could he retract it without making his program seem illogical and even ridiculous? "Satan," as Gandhi says, "forbade it." Realizing that "Satan's" voice was the voice of pride, he decided to retract the manifesto.
U||And on February 16,1922, there appeared in "Young India" one of the most extraordinary human documents ever written. It is Gandhi's mea culpa, his public confession. From the depths of his mortification words of thanks swell to his lips, of thanks to God for having humbled him:
U||    God has been abundantly kind to me. He has warned me for the third time that there is not as yet in India that truthful and non-violent atmosphere which, and which alone, can justify mass disobedience, which can be at all described as "civil," which means gentle, truthful, humble, knowing, wilful, yet loving, never criminal and hateful. He warned me in 1919 when the Rowlatt Act agitation was started. Ahmedabad, Viramvrag, and Kheda erred. I retraced my steps, called it a Himalayan miscalculation, humbled myself before God and man, and stopped not merely mass civil disobedience, but even my own.... The next time it was through the events of Bombay that God gave me a terrific warning. He made me eyewitness.... I announced my intention to stop the mass civil disobedience which was to be immediately started in Bardoli. The humiliation was greater than that in 1919. But it did me good and I am sure that the nations gained by the stopping. India stood for truth and non-violence by the suspension.
U||    But the bitterest humiliation was still to come.... God spoke clearly through Chauri-Chaura.... And when India claims to be non-violent and hopes to mount the throne of liberty through non-violent means, mob violence even in answer to grave provocation is a bad augury.... Non-violent attainment of self-government presupposes a non-violent control over the violent elements in the country. Non-violent non-coöperators can only succeed when they have succeeded in attaining control over the hooligan of India....
U||Therefore, on February 11, at Bardoli, he "put his doubts and troubles" before the working committee of the congress. They did not all agree with him. "But never," he said, "has a man been 'blessed,' perhaps, with colleagues and associates so considerate and forgiving."
U||They sympathized with his scruples and consented, at his request, to suspend the order of civil disobedience, urging at the same time that all organizations strive to create an atmosphere of non-violence.
U||    I know that the drastic reversal of practically the whole of the aggressive program may be politically unsound and unwise, but there is no doubt that it is religiously sound. The country will have gained by my humiliation and confession of error. The only virtue I want to claim is truth and non-violence. I lay no claim to superhuman powers. I want none. I wear the same corruptible flesh that the weakest of my fellow-beings wear, and am therefore as liable to err as any. My services have many limitations, but God has up to now blessed them in spite of the imperfections.
U||    For confession of error is like a broom that sweeps away dirt and leaves the surface cleaner and brighter. I feel stronger for my confession. And the cause must prosper for the retracing. Never has a man reached his destination by persistence in deviation from the straight path. It has been urged that Chauri-Chaura cannot affect Bardoli. ... I have no doubt whatsoever on that account. The people of Bardoli are, in my opinion, the most peaceful in India. But Bardoli is but a speck on the map of India. Its effort cannot succeed unless there is perfect coöperation from the other parts.... Just as the addition of a grain of arsenic to a pot of milk renders it unfit as food so will the civility of Bardoli prove unacceptable by the addition of the deadly poison from Chauri-Chaura.... The latter represents India as much as Bardoli. Chauri-Chaura is, after all, an aggravated symptom. In civil disobedience there should be no excitement. Civil disobedience is a preparation for mute suffering. Its effect is marvel
U||ous, though unperceived and gentle.... The tragedy of Chauri-Chaura is really the index-finger. It shows the way India may easily go if drastic precautions be not taken. If we are not to evolve violence out of non-violence, it is quite clear that we must hastily retrace our steps and reestablish an atmosphere of peace, and not think of starting mass civil disobedience until we are sure of peace being retained in spite of mass civil disobedience being started and in spite of government provocation.... Let the opponent glory in our humiliation and so-called defeat. It is better to be charged with cowardice than to be guilty of denial of our oath and sin against God....
U||And the apostle wants to redeem the blood shed by others:
U||    I must undergo personal cleansing. I must become a fitter instrument able to register the slightest variation in the moral atmosphere about me. My prayers must have deeper truth and humility. For me there is nothing so cleansing as a fast. A fast undertaken for fuller self-expression, for attainment of the spirit's supremacy over the flesh, is a most powerful factor in one's evolution....[115]
U||And he imposes on himself a continuous five days' fast. He does not want his co-workers to follow his example. He must punish himself. "I am in the unhappy position of a surgeon proved skill-less to deal with an admittedly dangerous case. I must either abdicate or acquire greater skill." His fast is penance and punishment for him and for the rioters of Chauri-Chaura who sinned with his name on their lips. Gandhi would like to suffer for them alone, but he advises them to hand themselves voluntarily to the Government and to make a clean confession, for they have injured the cause they meant to serve.
U||    I would suffer humiliation, every torture, absolute ostracism, and death itself to prevent the movement from becoming violent or a precursor of violence.
U||The history of humanity's spiritual progress can point to few pages as noble as these. The moral value of such an action is incomparable, but as a political move it was disconcerting. Gandhi himself admits it might be called "politically unsound and unwise." It is dangerous to assemble all the forces of a nation and to hold the nation, panting, before a prescribed movement, to lift one's arm to give the final command, and then, at the last moment, let one's arm drop and thrice call a halt just as the formidable machinery has been set in motion. One risks ruining the brakes and paralyzing the impetus.
U||Therefore, when the congress committee held its session at Delhi, February 24, 1922, Gandhi met with great opposition. The resolutions of the working committee of Bardoli, approved on the eleventh, were not ratified without discussion. The non-coöperators split into two camps. Gandhi claimed that before civil disobedience could be launched the people must be better prepared, and he submitted a constructive program. But many members were irritated at the slow progress of the independence movement, and they protested against the suspension of civil disobedience. Gandhi's methods, they claimed, were stifling the nation's ardor. A vote of censure against the working committee was proposed, and it was suggested that its resolutions be annulled. In the end, however, Gandhi triumphed. But he suffered keenly, for he realized that the majority was not backing him sincerely; he knew that more than one of those who voted for him called him "dictator" behind his back. He knew that, at bottom, he no longer reflected the
U|| sentiment of the country. And with his undaunted sincerity he admits this, March 2, 1922:
U||    There is so much undercurrent of violence, both conscious and unconscious, that I was actually and literally praying for a disastrous defeat. I have always been in a minority. In South Africa I started with practical unanimity, reached a minority of sixty-four and even sixteen, and went up again to a huge majority. The best and the most solid work was done in the wilderness of minority.... I know that the only thing that the Government dreads is this huge majority I seem to command. They little know that I dread it even more than they. I have become literally sick of the adoration of the unthinking multitude. I would feel certain of my ground if I was spat upon by them. A friend warned me against exploiting my "dictatorship." I have begun to wonder if I am not unconsciously allowing myself to be "exploited"! I confess that I have a dread of it as I never had before. My only safety lies in my shamelessness. I have warned my friends of the committee that I am incorrigible. I shall continue to confess blund
U||ers each time the people commit them. The only tyrant I accept in this world is the "still small voice" within. And even though I have to face the prospect of a minority of one, I humbly believe I have the courage to be in such a hopeless minority. That to me is the only truthful position. But I am a sadder and, I hope, a wiser man to-day. I see that our non-violence is skin-deep. We are burning with indignation. The Government is feeding it by its insensate acts. It seems almost as if the Government wants to see this land covered with murder, arson, and rapine in order to be able once more to claim exclusive ability to put them down.
U||    This non-violence, therefore, seems to be due merely to our helplessness. It almost appears as if we are nursing in our bosoms the desire to take revenge the first time we get the opportunity. Can true voluntary non-violence come out of this seeming forced non-violence of the weak? Is it not a futile experiment I am conducting? What if, when the fury bursts, not a man, woman, or child is safe and every man's hand is raised against his fellow-being? Of what avail is it, then, if I fast myself to death in the event of such a catastrophe coming to pass? Let us be truthful. If it is by force that we wish to gain Swaraj, let us drop non-violence and offer such violence as we may. It would be a manly, honest, and sober attitude, and no one can then accuse us of the terrible charge of hypocrisy.[116] If, in spite of all my warnings... the majority did not believe in our goal, although they accepted it without a single material change, I would ask them to realize their responsibility. They are not bound to rush 
U||to civil disobedience, but to settle down to the quiet work of construction. If we do not take care, we are likely to be drowned in the waters whose depth we do not know....
U||    Those who do not believe in the creed should surely retire from the congress.
U||And, turning to the minority, Gandhi adds:
U||    The patriotic spirit demands loyal and strict adherence to non-violence and truth. Those who do not believe in them should retire from the congress organization.
U||There is bitter sadness, but a proud manliness, in these forceful words. It was the night in Gethsemane. Gandhi's arrest was imminent. Who knows whether, in his heart, he did not look upon imprisonment as a delivery?
U||§ 3
U||Gandhi had for a long time been expecting to be arrested. Ever since November 10, 1920, all his affairs had been in order and he himself prepared. He had dictated his instructions to the people in his article, "If I Am Arrested." He referred to this possibility again in an article dated March 9, 1922, when the rumor of his arrest again cropped up. He says he does not fear the Government. "Rivers of blood shed by the Government cannot frighten me." The only thing he fears is that the people may be carried away at the news of his arrest. This would be a disgrace to him. "I desire that the people should maintain perfect self-control and consider the day of my arrest a day of rejoicing. The Government believes that I am the soul of all this agitation and that if I am removed it will be left in peace. The only thing that remains is for it to measure the strength of the people. Let the people preserve perfect peace and calmness. It is a matter of no pride or pleasure to me, but of humiliation, that the Government 
U||refrain from arresting me for fear of an outbreak of universal violence." Let the people carry out the whole constructive program. Let there be no hartals or demonstrations, no cooperation with the Government. Let courts and schools be boycotted. Let, in short, the program of non-coöperation be pursued in absolute order and discipline. If the people can live up to this program, they will win. Otherwise they will face disaster.
U||When everything was in readiness, Gandhi went to his cherished retreat at the Ashram of Sarbarmati, near Ahmedabad, to await, in quiet meditation and surrounded by his beloved disciples, the coming of the constables. He longed for imprisonment. In his absence India would affirm her purpose with greater strength. And, as he says, imprisonment would give him "a quiet and physical rest," which he perhaps deserved.[117]
U||The constables arrived on the night of March 10. News had reached the Ashram of their coming. The Mahatma was ready, and placed himself at their disposal. On the way to prison he met Maulana Hasrat Mohani, a Mohammedan friend who had come from far to give him a last embrace. Banker, the editor of "Young India," was sent to jail along with the master. Gandhi's wife was allowed to accompany her husband as far as the prison gates.
U||At noon of Saturday, March 18, Gandhi's "Great Trial"[118] began before Mr. C. N. Broomsfield, district and session judge of Ahmedabad. It was a manifestation of rare nobility and high-mindedness. Judge and accused vied with each other in chivalrous courtesy. Never in the struggle did England rise to more magnanimous impartiality. Judge Broomsfield that day made up for many faults of the Government. Since much has been written about the trial, I will only summarize the main points.
U||Why had the Government at last arrested Gandhi? Why, after contemplating this move for more than two years, did it choose the very moment when the Mahatma had quelled the mob movement and when he seemed to stand as the only barrier against violence? Was it acting in aberration? Or did it wish to lend confirmation to Gandhi's terrible words: "It seems almost as if the Government wants to see this land covered with murder, arson, and rapine in order to be able to claim exclusive ability to put them down"? The Government was in a very difficult position. It respected and feared Gandhi. It would have liked to treat him gently. But Gandhi did not treat the Government gently. The Mahatma condemned violence, but his non-violence was more revolutionary than any violence. The very same day that he stopped civil disobedience for the mass, or rather the day before the session of the congress at Delhi, on February 23, he wrote one of the most menacing articles to Great Britain's power. An insolent telegram from Lord Bir
U||kenhead and Mr. Montagu had struck India as a blow.[119]
U||In a burst of indignation Gandhi took up the challenge:
U||    How can there be any compromise whilst the British lion continues to shake his gory claws in our faces? The British Empire, which is based upon organized exploitation of physically weaker races and upon a continuous exhibition of brute force, cannot live if there is a just God ruling the universe.... It is high time that the British people were made to realize that the fight that was commenced in 1920 is a fight to the finish, whether it lasts one month or one year or many months or many years. I shall only hope and pray that God will give India sufficient humility and sufficient strength to remain non-violent to the end. Submission to the insolent challenges that are cabled is now an utter impossibility.
U||Gandhi was indicted on the statements contained in this article and in two other articles, the one dated September 19, 1921, and the other December 15, 1921. The first referred to the arrest of the Ali brothers, and the second was a reply to a speech of Lord Reading. Both of them contain the same declaration of "fight to the finish. We want Swaraj, we want the Government to yield to popular will. We ask for no quarter and expect none." The accusation, therefore, charged that Gandhi had "preached disaffection toward the Government and had openly instigated others to overthrow it." Gandhi spoke in his own defense. He pleaded guilty to all charges.
U||The advocate-general, Sir J. T. Strangman of Bombay, claimed that the three articles cited by the accusation were not isolated, but were part of a general campaign pursued for two years in view of overthrowing the Government, and he quoted passages from Gandhi's articles. He paid tribute to Gandhi's high character. But this only served to lend authority to the articles and to increase their harmful influence. He held Gandhi responsible for the bloodshed at Bombay and at Chauri-Chaura. It was true that Gandhi preached non-violence, but he also preached disaffection. He was therefore responsible for the violence committed by the people.
U||Gandhi asked permission to speak. The torment as to what was right and wrong, the anguish, the doubts, the mental and spiritual struggle of the last weeks as to which course he should pursue and the effect it would have on the people, had been cleared away. He had recovered the serenity of his soul. He accepted everything that had taken place and everything that was to take place as a necessity which he might regret, but which he would have to bear. He agreed with the advocate-general. Yes, he was responsible. He was responsible for everything. He had preached disaffection for a much longer time than the accusation had stated. He assumed responsibility for the troubles at Madras, for the "diabolical crimes" of Chauri-Chaura, and the "mad outrages" of Bombay.
U||    The learned advocate-general is quite right when he says that as a man of responsibility, a man having received a fair share of education, having had a fair share of experience of this world, I should have known the consequences of every one of my acts. I knew that I was playing with fire, I ran the risk, and if I was set free, I would still do the same. I felt this morning that I would have failed in my duty if I did not say what I say here just now.
U||    I wanted to avoid violence, I want to avoid violence. Non-violence is the first article of my faith. It is also the last article of my creed. But I had to make my choice. I had either to submit to a system which I considered had done an irreparable harm to my country or incur the risk of the mad fury of my people bursting forth when they understood the truth from my lips. I know that my people have sometimes gone mad. I am deeply sorry for it and I am therefore here to submit not to a light penalty, but to the highest penalty. I do not ask for mercy. I do not plead any extenuating act. I am here, therefore, to invite and cheerfully submit to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen. The only course open to you, Judge, is either to resign your post or inflict on me the severest penalty.
U||After this powerful improvisation, where the scruples of a religious spirit are balanced by the heroic firmness of a political leader, Gandhi read a written declaration addressed to the public in India and England. He owed it to them, he said, to explain why, "from a stanch loyalist and coöperator," he had become an uncompromising disaffectionist and non-coöperator. He dwelt on his public life from 1893 on. He pointed out all he had to suffer, as an Indian, from the British system, and he told of his ceaseless attempts for twenty-five years to reform it. He believed obstinately that this could be accomplished without separating India and England. In spite of all deceptions, he remained a stanch coöperator till 1919. But since then outrages and crimes have surpassed all measure. And instead of making up for injustices, the Government, as if in defiance to the spirit of India, has honored, pensioned, and rewarded its guilty servants. The Government itself has severed all ties. Gandhi has come to the conclus
U||ion that even if the desired reforms were now proposed by the Government, they would be harmful. The Government in British India is based on the exploitation of the masses. Laws are made in view of strengthening this exploitation. The administration of the law is prostituted consciously or unconsciously for the benefit of the exploiter. A subtle, but effective, system of terrorization and an organized display of force have emasculated the people and "induced in them the habit of simulation." India is starving, ruined, degraded; and many claim that before India becomes capable of self-government on the dominion plan generations will have to pass. England has done more harm to India than any previous system. Non-coöperation with evil is a duty. Gandhi' has done his duty. But whereas in the past non-coöperation has been deliberately expressed in the form of violence inflicted on the evildoer, violence having been the supreme weapon, Gandhi has given his people the new, but indomitable, arm of non-violence.
U||And then came the chivalrous match between Judge Broomsfield and the Mahatma.
U||    Mr. Gandhi, you have made my task easy in one way by pleading guilty to the charges; nevertheless what remains, namely the determination of a just sentence, is perhaps as difficult a proposition as a judge in this country could have to face.... It would be impossible to ignore the fact that in the eyes of millions of your countrymen you are a great patriot and a great leader. Even those who differ from you in politics look upon you as a man of high ideals and of noble and even saintly life.... But it is my duty to judge you as a man subject to the law.... There are probably few people in India who do not sincerely regret that you should have made it impossible for any Government to leave you at liberty. But it is so. I am trying to balance what is due to you against what appears to me to be necessary in the interest of the public.
U||With great courtesy he consulted the accused as to the sentence which should be imposed. "You will not consider it unreasonable, I think, to be classed with Mr. Tilak," sentenced twelve years previously to six years. "If the course of events in India should make it possible for the Government to reduce the period and release you, no one will be better pleased than I."
U||Gandhi did not allow the judge to outdo him in courtesy. He claimed it was his proudest privilege and honor to have his name associated with that of Tilak. So far as the sentence itself was concerned, he considered it as light as any judge could impose on him, and as far as the whole proceedings were concerned, he said that he could not have expected greater courtesy.[120]
U||The trial was over. Gandhi's friends fell at his feet, sobbing. The Mahatma took leave of them, smiling. And the door of the jail of Sarbamati closed behind him.[121]

U||Ever since the great apostle's voice has been silent. His body is walled in as in a tomb. But never did a tomb act as a barrier to thought, and Gandhi's invisible soul still animates India's vast body. "Peace, non-violence, suffering,"[122] is the only message that has come from the prison. The message has been heard. From one end of the country to the other the watchword has been passed. Three years earlier India would have been swept by bloodshed at Gandhi's arrest. The mere report of its having taken place caused riots among the population in 1920. But the sentence of Ahmedabad was received with religious solemnity. Thousands of Indians with serene joyfulness handed themselves over to prison guards. Non-violence and suffering—one example more amazing than the others—may serve to show to what depths the divine words have penetrated into the spirit of the nation.
U||As is well known, the Sikhs have always been looked upon as one of the most warlike races in India. Large numbers of them served in the army during the war. Last year grave dissensions arose among them. To our Western eyes the cause seems insignificant. As the result of a religious effervescence, one of the Sikh sects, the Akalis, wished to purify the sanctuaries. The latter had fallen into the hands of guardians of ill repute who refused to be put out. For legal reasons the Government took their defense. And in August, 1922, began the daily martyrdom of Guru-Ka-Bagh.[123] The Akalis adopted the doctrine of non-resistance. A thousand of them settled near the sanctuary, while four thousand took up abode in the Golden Temple at Amritsar, ten miles away. Every day one hundred from among the four thousand, most of them men of military age, many of whom served in the war, left the Golden Temple, after taking the vow of remaining true to the principles of non-violence in thought as well as action, and of reaching 
U||Guru-Ka-Bagh or being brought back unconscious. Among the group of the thousand volunteers twenty-five made the same vow every day. Not far from the sanctuary the British constables waited at the bridge with iron-tipped rods to stop the manifestation. And every day a gruesome scene took place. Andrews, Tagore's friend, describes it unforgettably in his "Akali Struggle."[124] With a wreath of small white flowers around their black turbans, the Akalis arrived silently before the constables, and at a distance of about a yard they stopped and began to pray, silently, motionlessly. The constables, in order to drive them away, prodded them with the iron-tipped rods, jabbing harder and harder till blood began to flow and the Sikhs fell unconscious. Those who could get to their feet would begin to pray again, until they were beaten into unconsciousness like the others. Andrews did not hear a single cry, nor did he see a defiant glance. Near-by, a crowd of spectators, their faces tense with anguish, prayed silently. 
U||"I could not help thinking," Andrews says, "of the shadow of the cross." The English described the scene in their papers and expressed amazement.[125] It seemed incomprehensible to the British, although they had to admit that the absurd sacrifice proved that the idea of non-coöperation and non-violence was gaining ground and that the people of the Punjab had been won over to the doctrine. Andrews, whose generous spirit and pure idealism enabled him to penetrate the soul of India, says that here he saw, like Goethe at Valmy, "the dawn of a new era. A new heroism, steeled by suffering, has risen, a war of the spirit."
U||It would seem as if the people of India have lived up to Mahatma's spirit more faithfully than those whose mission it was to guide them. I have already spoken of the opposition to Gandhi at the session of the congress committee at Delhi twenty days before the master was arrested. This opposition still manifested itself when the committee met again, at Lucknow, June 7, 1922. The program of patient waiting and silent reconstruction advocated by Gandhi was bitterly criticized, and a motion was made to proclaim civil disobedience. A commission was appointed to inquire into conditions and determine whether the country might be called ripe for civil disobedience. The commission traveled all over India, and in the autumn sent in a discouraging report. Not only was civil disobedience called impractical for the present, but half the members went to such extremes of conservatism as to suggest that Gandhi's methods of non-coöperation be abandoned and a new Swaraj or home rule party be formed within the government coun
U||cils. Gandhi's doctrine was, in other words, attacked by those who believed in violence, as well as by those who believed in prudence.
U||India, however, did not accept the commission's report. In its annual meeting at the end of December, 1922, the National Indian Congress energetically proclaimed its allegiance to the persecuted master and his doctrine of non-coöperation. By 1740 votes to 890 it rejected all participation in government councils. As for those who believed in violence, they were few and far between and had little influence. The session closed with a unanimous resolution urging that the political strike ordered by Gandhi be kept up. A resolution boycotting English materials, however, was turned down, in order not to antagonize European workmen. But the Mussulman conference of the Khilafat, as usual more audacious than the congress, voted for the boycott by a large majority.
U||Here we must stop the record of the Gandhist movement. Despite a few inevitable backslides due to the absence of the master and his best disciples, imprisoned like himself (especially the Ali brothers), the movement has successfully passed through the trials of the first unguided year. And the English press, at the close of the session of the congress of 1922 at Gaya, expresses surprise and disappointment at the progress of the movement.[126]
U||§ 5
U||And what will now come? Will England, wiser for past experiences, know how to mold the aspirations of the people of India? And will this people remain true to its ideal? Nations have short memories, and I should have but slight faith in India's power to remain true to the Mahatma's teaching if his doctrines were not an expression of the deepest and most ancient longings of the race. For if there is such a thing as genius, great by its own strength whether or not it corresponds to the ideals of its surroundings, there can be no genius of action, no leader, who does not incarnate the instincts of his race, satisfy the need of the hour, and requite the yearning of the world.
U||Mahatma Gandhi does all this. His principle of Ahimsa (non-violence) has been inscribed in the spirit of India for more than two thousand years. Mahavira, Buddha, and the cult of Vishnu have made it the substance of millions of souls. Gandhi has merely transfused heroic blood into it. He called upon the great shadows, the forces of the past, plunged in mortal lethargy, and at the sound of his voice they came to life. In him they found themselves. Gandhi is more than a word; he is an example. He incarnates the spirit of his people. Blessed the man who is a people, his people, entombed, and then resuscitated in him! But such resurrections are never haphazard. If the spirit of India now surges forth from temples and forests, it is because it holds the message for which the world is sighing.
U||This message carries far beyond the boundaries of India. India alone could formulate it, but it consecrates the nation's greatness as much as its sacrifice. It may become its cross.
U||For it would seem as if a people must he sacrificed in order to give new life to the world. The Jews were sacrificed to their Messiah, whom they had borne for centuries in their thoughts, and whom they did not recognize when He finally flowered on the blood-stained cross. More fortunate, India has recognized her Messiah, and joyously the people march to the sacrifice which is to set them free.
U||But, like the early Christians, they do not all understand the real meaning of their liberation. For a long time the Christians awaited the fulfilment of the adveniat regnum tuum. In India there are many who do not see beyond Swaraj, home rule. Incidentally, I imagine that this political goal will soon be reached. Europe, bled by wars and revolutions, impoverished and exhausted, despoiled of her prestige in the eyes of Asia, which she formerly oppressed, cannot long resist on Asiatic soil the aspirations of the awakened peoples of Islam, India, China, and Japan. But this would mean little, no matter how rich and new might be the harmonies which a few more nations would bring to the human symphony; this would mean little, if the surging spirit of Asia did not become the vehicle for a new ideal of life and of death, and, what is more, of action, for all humanity, and if it did not bring a new viaticum to prostrate Europe.
U||The world is swept by the wind of violence. This storm which ravages the harvest of our civilization did not break out from a clear sky. Centuries of brutal national pride, whetted by the idolatrous ideology of the Revolution, spread by the empty mockery of democracies, and crowned by a century of inhuman industrialism, rapacious plutocracy, and a materialistic system of economics where the soul perishes, stifled to death, were bound to culminate in these dark struggles where the treasures of the West succumbed. It is not enough to say all this was inevitable. There is a in it. Each people kills the other in the name of the same principles which hid the same covetousness and Cainish instincts. All—be they nationalists, Fascists, Bolshevists, members of the oppressed classes, members of the oppressing classes—claim that they have the right to use force, while refusing this right to others. Half a century ago might dominated right. To-day things are far worse. Might is right. Might has devoured right.
U||In the old crumbling world, no refuge, no hope, no great light. The church gives innocuous advice, virtuous and dosed, carefully worded so as not to antagonize the mighty. Besides, the church never sets the example—even when giving advice. Weak pacifists bray languishingly, and you feel that they hesitate and fumble, talk about a faith they no longer believe in. Who will prove this faith? And how, in an unbelieving world? Faith is proved by action.
U||This is the great message to the world, or, as Gandhi puts it, India's message—self-sacrifice.
U||And Tagore has repeated the same inspired words, for on this proud principle Tagore and Gandhi agree.
U||    I hope this spirit of sacrifice will grow, and also the will to suffer.... This is real liberty. Nothing is higher, not even national independence. The West has an unshakable belief in force and material wealth; therefore no matter how much it cries for peace and disarmament, its ferocity will cry still louder.... We, in India, must show the world what this truth is which not only makes disarmament possible but transmutes it into strength. The fact that moral force is a stronger power than brute force will be proved by an unarmed people. The evolution of life shows that it has gradually cast off its formidable armature of scales and carapaces and a monstrous quantity of flesh until man was evolved who conquered brute force. The day will come when a weak, noble man absolutely unarmed will prove that the meek shall inherit the earth. It is logical that Mahatma Gandhi, weak of body and without material resources, should prove the unconquerable strength of the meek and the humble hidden in the heart of the o
U||utraged and destitute humanity of India. India's destiny is bound up in Narayana and not in Narayani-sena, in soul force and not muscle. It must uplift human history, transport it from the confused valley of material struggles to the high plateaux of spiritual battles. Although we may delude ourselves through phrases acquired from the vocabulary of the West, Swaraj, home rule, is not really our goal. Our battle is a spiritual battle, a fight for humanity. We must emancipate man from the meshes he has woven around him, free him from the organizations of national selfishness. We must persuade the butterfly that the freedom of the sky is better than the shelter of the cocoon. In India we have no word for "nation." When we loan the word from other peoples it is not suited to us, for we should ally ourselves with Narayana, the Supreme Being, and our victory will be the victory for God's world.... If we can defy the powerful, the rich, the armed, by showing the world the power of the immortal spirit, the castle of
U|| the giant Flesh will crumble into nothingness. And then man will find real Swaraj. We, the miserable outcasts of the Orient, we must conquer freedom for all humanity....
U||"Our object," Gandhi has said, "is friendship with the whole world. Non-violence has come to men, and it will remain. It is the annunciation of peace on earth."
U||The peace of the world is far off. We have no illusions. We have seen, abundantly, during the course of half a century, the hypocrisy, the cowardice, and the cruelty of mankind. But this does not prevent us from loving mankind. For even among the worst there is a nescio quid Dei. We know the material ties that weigh on twentieth-century Europe, the crushing determinism of economic conditions which hem it in; we know that centuries of passions and systematized error have built a crust about our souls which the light cannot pierce. But we also know what miracles the spirit can work.
U||Historians, we have seen its glory brighten skies even darker than our own. We, who live but a day, have caught in India the sound of the tambour of Çiva, "the Master Dancer who veils his devouring eye and guards his steps to save the world from plunging into the abyss."[127]
U||The Realpolitiker of violence, whether revolutionary or reactionary, ridicule our faith, and reveal thereby their ignorance of deep reality. Let them jeer! I have this faith. I know it is scorned and persecuted in Europe, and that in my own land we are but a handful—are we even a handful?—who believe in it. And even if I were the only one to believe in it, what would it matter? The true characteristic of faith is not to deny the hostility of the world, but to recognize it and to believe in spite of it! Faith is a battle. And our non-violence is the most desperate battle. The way to peace is not through weakness. We do not fight violence so much as weakness. Nothing is worth while unless it is strong, neither good nor evil. Absolute evil is better than emasculated goodness. Moaning pacifism is the death-knell of peace; it is cowardice and lack of faith. Let those who do not believe, who fear, withdraw! The way to peace leads through self-sacrifice.
U||This is Gandhi's message. The only thing lacking is the cross.[128] Every one knows that had it not been for the Jews, Rome would not have given it to Christ. The British Empire is no better than ancient Rome. The impetus has been given. The soul of Oriental peoples has been moved in its deepest fibers, and its vibrations are felt the whole world over.
U||The great religious apparitions of the Orient are ruled by a rhythm. One thing is certain: either Gandhi's spirit will triumph, or it will manifest itself again, as were manifested, centuries before, the Messiah and Buddha, till there finally is manifested, in a mortal half-god, the perfect incarnation of the principle of life which will lead a new humanity on to a new path.
U||[113]One hundred and forty villages, 87,000 inhabitants.
U||[114]A note in "Young India" of the same date is even more explicit. If the viceroy does not answer, civil obedience will be proclaimed even if against the will of the majority.
U||[115]What light these words throw on the mysterious power of this soul where all the emotions of hit people are inscribed!
U||[116]Gandhi had come to realize that some of the majority members who voted for non-violence looked upon it, in their hearts, as a political expedient paving the way, covertly, to violence. They spoke suavely, he says, "of delivering non-violent blows." Gandhi had not grasped the danger, as Tagore had, long before. But he was horror-struck. And, more harshly than Tagore, he denounced and attacked the majority's attitude.
U||[117]March 9, 1922.
U||[118]"The Great Trial, Young India," March 23, 1922.
U||[119]"If the existence of our Empire were challenged, the discharge of responsibilities of the British Government to India prevented and demands were made in the very mistaken belief that we contemplated retreat from India, then India would not challenge with success the most determined people in the world who once again would answer with all the vigor and determination at its command."
U||[120]Mr. Banker, the editor of "Young India," who, during the trial, had followed the master's example and acquiesced in all his statements, was sentenced to a fine and imprisonment for one year.
U||[121]Mrs. Kasturibai Gandhi informed the people of India of the sentence imposed on Gandhi, in a very beautiful message, urging them in peace and quiet to concentrate on carrying out Gandhi's constructive program.
U||Gandhi did not remain in the prison of Sarbamati, where he was well treated, but was transferred to an unknown jail and then to Yeravda, near Poona. According to a statement made by N. D. Hardiker, "Gandhi in Prison, Unity," May 18, 1922, which we are unable to verify, Gandhi has been placed in a cell like the common-law criminals, and is allowed no privileges of any kind. It is claimed that his delicate health has suffered through this regime.
U||"Mr. C. F. Andrews, speaking of Gandhi's imprisonment, told me that the Mahatma was happy in prison and that he had asked his friends not to visit him. He is purifying himself, he prays and feels convinced that in this way he is working in the most efficacious way for India."
U||Incidentally Mr. Andrews states that the Gandhist party in India has gained strength by the Mahatma's imprisonment. India believes in Gandhi with more fervor than ever before. It persists in looking upon him as an incarnation of Sri-Krishna, who was also subjected to the trial of imprisonment. And Gandhi, in jail, has more effectively prevented the explosion of that violence which he feared than if he had been at liberty.
U||[122]On August 3, 1922, "Unity" published a "Letter from Prison" where Gandhi speaks about the evils of modern civilization. The letter seems apocryphal to me. I should imagine it a summary of extracts written some time ago, particularly in the "Hind Swaraj."
U||[123]Guru-Ka-Bagh is a sanctuary (Gurdwara) about ten miles from Amritsar.
U||[124]"The Akali Struggle," by Andrews, professor at Santiniketan. Published in the "Swaraiya" of Madras and under separate cover. September 1, 1922.
U||[125]"Manchester Guardian Weekly," October 13, 1922.
U||[126]An article by Blanche Watson, in "Unity," November 16, 1922, enumerates the advantages which India has won by her fight of non-violent resistance.
U||This article claims that the internal revenues of India have decreased some seventy million dollars, and that the boycott of English goods has caused England to lose, in the course of a single year, some twenty million dollars. She claims that at that time about thirty thousand Indians were imprisoned, and that the governmental machinery was entirely upset. But Blanche Watson, who is a fervent admirer of Gandhism, has, perhaps, an unconscious tendency to exaggerate its successes. Other testimony would seem to be less encouraging and would seem to prove that the spirit of self-sacrifice is balked by the selfish attitude of the wealthy and of business people, while many of those who resigned from government posts in the first flush of enthusiasm have now returned to work. It would not be human to believe anything else. In every revolution many lag on behind, or retrace their steps. The point is to determine whether, or not, on the whole, the movement is on the increase or the decrease. In this connection it is
U|| interesting to refer to a description published in the "Manchester Guardian Weekly," February 16, 1928.
U||The "Manchester Guardian," whose intelligent liberalism is well known, but which nevertheless represents certain powerful interests directly imperiled by the non-coöperation movement, recently organized an investigation of conditions in India. The conclusion one draws after reading the results of this inquiry, in spite of a very natural tendency to discredit the movement, is that the situation is serious and causes grave misgivings. The last article (February 16, 1923) tries to prove that Gandhi's tactics have been proved ineffective and that the non-coöperation movement must be reorganized. But the article goes on to say that the spirit of non-coöperation is growing. Everywhere there are traces of distrust of the foreign Government and ardent hope of getting rid of it. The most cultivated people in India and the inhabitants of the large cities agree on this point. The ryot, or peasant, is only slightly affected by the movement, but conditions are such in the villages that within a short time he will have
U|| to take sides. The army still seems immune, but recruits come from the villages, and sooner or later they will be contaminated. The non-coöperation movement is frequently most intense among the best and the most moderate elements. These elements disapprove revolutionary methods, but their disapproval is not shared by the rest of the country. The writer claims that it will take about ten years for India really to bring about effective civil disobedience. But in the meantime the situation will grow more and more serious. It is impossible to hold the Indians in check by threatening them with imprisonment. They no longer fear it. Harsher coercive measures must be resorted to, and this will stir up hatred. There is only one peaceful solution—if it is not already too late—and that is for England to take the initiative of making Indian reforms. No half-measures, like those of 1919, and not applied till last year! They are not sufficient, and there is no time to lose. England must call a National Indian Conven
U||tion where all parties and interests in India will be represented—Gandhi and his disciples as well as Indian princes and European capitalists, Mohammedans, Hindus, Parsees, Eurasians, Christians, pariahs—all must join in a convention and draft a constitution for an autonomous India within the empire and draw up the lines of such a home rule. This is the only way to avoid the breaking up of the empire.
U||I do not know how the Government of India and British bureaucracy look upon the "Manchester Guardian's" suggestion, and I hardly believe that Gandhi and his non-coöperators would agree to sit in a convention with European and Indian capitalists. But one thing is sure, and that is that no one questions, any more, India's right to home rule. It must come in one way or another. And nothing is more remarkable than the change of England's attitude to India since the beginning of the Gandhist movement. The European no longer scorns the Indian but treats him with consideration. Everybody agrees that it is a mistake to employ the violent methods which were the first the Governments resorted to in former days. From a spiritual and mental point of view, India is already victorious.
U||[127]Fragment of the oldest Invocation of Çiva, in the play "Mudra-Rakshasha" (400) by Vishakadatta.
U||[128]This is the standpoint of the "conscientious objectors" in England, which is spreading little by little to other countries.

U||THIRD CLASS IN INDIAN RAILWAYS[1]
U||I have now been in India for over two years and a half after my return from South Africa. Over one quarter of that time I have passed on the Indian trains travelling third class by choice. I have travelled up north as far as Lahore, down south up to Tranquebar, and from Karachi to Calcutta. Having resorted to third class travelling, among other reasons, for the purpose of studying the conditions under which this class of passengers travel, I have naturally made as critical observations as I could. I have fairly covered the majority of railway systems during this period. Now and then I have entered into correspondence with the management of the different railways about the defects that have come under my notice. But I think that the time has come when I should invite the press and the public to join in a crusade against a grievance which has too long remained unredressed, though much of it is capable of redress without great difficulty.
U||On the 12th instant I booked at Bombay for Madras by the mail train and paid Rs. 13-9. It was labelled to carry 22 passengers. These could only have seating accommodation. There were no bunks in this carriage whereon passengers could lie with any degree of safety or comfort. There were two nights to be passed in this train before reaching Madras. If not more than 22 passengers found their way into my carriage before we reached Poona, it was because the bolder ones kept the others at bay. With the exception of two or three insistent passengers, all had to find their sleep being seated all the time. After reaching Raichur the pressure became [Pg 4]unbearable. The rush of passengers could not be stayed. The fighters among us found the task almost beyond them. The guards or other railway servants came in only to push in more passengers.
U||A defiant Memon merchant protested against this packing of passengers like sardines. In vain did he say that this was his fifth night on the train. The guard insulted him and referred him to the management at the terminus. There were during this night as many as 35 passengers in the carriage during the greater part of it. Some lay on the floor in the midst of dirt and some had to keep standing. A free fight was, at one time, avoided only by the intervention of some of the older passengers who did not want to add to the discomfort by an exhibition of temper.
U||On the way passengers got for tea tannin water with filthy sugar and a whitish looking liquid mis-called milk which gave this water a muddy appearance. I can vouch for the appearance, but I cite the testimony of the passengers as to the taste.
U||Not during the whole of the journey was the compartment once swept or cleaned. The result was that every time you walked on the floor or rather cut your way through the passengers seated on the floor, you waded through dirt.
U||The closet was also not cleaned during the journey and there was no water in the water tank.
U||Refreshments sold to the passengers were dirty-looking, handed by dirtier hands, coming out of filthy receptacles and weighed in equally unattractive scales. These were previously sampled by millions of flies. I asked some of the passengers who went in for these dainties to give their opinion. Many of them used choice expressions as to the quality but were satisfied to state that they were helpless in the matter; they had to take things as they came.
U||On reaching the station I found that the ghari-wala would not take me unless I paid the fare he wanted. I mildly protested and told him I would[Pg 5] pay him the authorised fare. I had to turn passive resister before I could be taken. I simply told him he would have to pull me out of the ghari or call the policeman.
U||The return journey was performed in no better manner. The carriage was packed already and but for a friend's intervention I could not have been able to secure even a seat. My admission was certainly beyond the authorised number. This compartment was constructed to carry 9 passengers but it had constantly 12 in it. At one place an important railway servant swore at a protestant, threatened to strike him and locked the door over the passengers whom he had with difficulty squeezed in. To this compartment there was a closet falsely so called. It was designed as a European closet but could hardly be used as such. There was a pipe in it but no water, and I say without fear of challenge that it was pestilentially dirty.
U||The compartment itself was evil looking. Dirt was lying thick upon the wood work and I do not know that it had ever seen soap or water.
U||The compartment had an exceptional assortment of passengers. There were three stalwart Punjabi Mahomedans, two refined Tamilians and two Mahomedan merchants who joined us later. The merchants related the bribes they had to give to procure comfort. One of the Punjabis had already travelled three nights and was weary and fatigued. But he could not stretch himself. He said he had sat the whole day at the Central Station watching passengers giving bribe to procure their tickets. Another said he had himself to pay Rs. 5 before he could get his ticket and his seat. These three men were bound for Ludhiana and had still more nights of travel in store for them.
U||What I have described is not exceptional but normal. I have got down at Raichur, Dhond, Sonepur, Chakradharpur, Purulia, Asansol and other junction stations and been at the 'Mosafirkhanas' attached to these stations. They are [Pg 6]discreditable-looking places where there is no order, no cleanliness but utter confusion and horrible din and noise. Passengers have no benches or not enough to sit on. They squat on dirty floors and eat dirty food. They are permitted to throw the leavings of their food and spit where they like, sit how they like and smoke everywhere. The closets attached to these places defy description. I have not the power adequately to describe them without committing a breach of the laws of decent speech. Disinfecting powder, ashes, or disinfecting fluids are unknown. The army of flies buzzing about them warns you against their use. But a third-class traveller is dumb and helpless. He does not want to complain even though to go to these places may be to court death. I know passengers who fast
U|| while they are travelling just in order to lessen the misery of their life in the trains. At Sonepur flies having failed, wasps have come forth to warn the public and the authorities, but yet to no purpose. At the Imperial Capital a certain third class booking-office is a Black-Hole fit only to be destroyed.
U||Is it any wonder that plague has become endemic in India? Any other result is impossible where passengers always leave some dirt where they go and take more on leaving.
U||On Indian trains alone passengers smoke with impunity in all carriages irrespective of the presence of the fair sex and irrespective of the protest of non-smokers. And this, notwithstanding a bye-law which prevents a passenger from smoking without the permission of his fellows in the compartment which is not allotted to smokers.
U||The existence of the awful war cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the removal of this gigantic evil. War can be no warrant for tolerating dirt and overcrowding. One could understand an entire stoppage of passenger traffic in a crisis like this, but never a continuation or accentuation of insanitation and conditions that must undermine health and morality.
U||[Pg 7]
U||Compare the lot of the first class passengers with that of the third class. In the Madras case the first class fare is over five times as much as the third class fare. Does the third class passenger get one-fifth, even one-tenth, of the comforts of his first class fellow? It is but simple justice to claim that some relative proportion be observed between the cost and comfort.
U||It is a known fact that the third class traffic pays for the ever-increasing luxuries of first and second class travelling. Surely a third class passenger is entitled at least to the bare necessities of life.
U||In neglecting the third class passengers, opportunity of giving a splendid education to millions in orderliness, sanitation, decent composite life and cultivation of simple and clean tastes is being lost. Instead of receiving an object lesson in these matters third class passengers have their sense of decency and cleanliness blunted during their travelling experience.
U||Among the many suggestions that can be made for dealing with the evil here described, I would respectfully include this: let the people in high places, the Viceroy, the Commander-in-Chief, the Rajas, Maharajas, the Imperial Councillors and others, who generally travel in superior classes, without previous warning, go through the experiences now and then of third class travelling. We would then soon see a remarkable change in the conditions of third class travelling and the uncomplaining millions will get some return for the fares they pay under the expectation of being carried from place to place with ordinary creature comforts.

U||VERNACULARS AS MEDIA OF INSTRUCTION[2]
U||It is to be hoped that Dr. Mehta's labour of love will receive the serious attention of English-educated India. The following pages were written by him for the Vedanta Kesari of Madras and are now printed in their present form for circulation throughout India. The question of vernaculars as media of instruction is of national importance; neglect of the vernaculars means national suicide. One hears many protagonists of the English language being continued as the medium of instruction pointing to the fact that English-educated Indians are the sole custodians of public and patriotic work. It would be monstrous if it were not so. For the only education given in this country is through the English language. The fact, however, is that the results are not all proportionate to the time we give to our education. We have not reacted on the masses. But I must not anticipate Dr. Mehta. He is in earnest. He writes feelingly. He has examined the pros and cons and collected a mass of evidence in support of his arguments. T
U||he latest pronouncement on the subject is that of the Viceroy. Whilst His Excellency is unable to offer a solution, he is keenly alive to the necessity of imparting instruction in our schools through the vernaculars. The Jews of Middle and Eastern Europe, who are scattered in all parts of the world, finding it necessary to have a common tongue for mutual intercourse, have raised Yiddish to the status of a language, and have succeeded in translating into Yiddish the best books to be found in the world's literature. Even they could not satisfy the soul's yearning through the many foreign tongues of which they are masters; nor did[Pg 9] the learned few among them wish to tax the masses of the Jewish population with having to learn a foreign language before they could realise their dignity. So they have enriched what was at one time looked upon as a mere jargon—but what the Jewish children learnt from their mothers—by taking special pains to translate into it the best thought of the world. This is a truly ma
U||rvellous work. It has been done during the present generation, and Webster's Dictionary defines it as a polyglot jargon used for inter-communication by Jews from different nations.
U||But a Jew of Middle and Eastern Europe would feel insulted if his mother tongue were now so described. If these Jewish scholars have succeeded, within a generation, in giving their masses a language of which they may feel proud, surely it should be an easy task for us to supply the needs of our own vernaculars which are cultured languages. South Africa teaches us the same lesson. There was a duel there between the Taal, a corrupt form of Dutch, and English. The Boer mothers and the Boer fathers were determined that they would not let their children, with whom they in their infancy talked in the Taal, be weighed down with having to receive instruction through English. The case for English here was a strong one. It had able pleaders for it. But English had to yield before Boer patriotism. It may be observed that they rejected even the High Dutch. The school masters, therefore, who are accustomed to speak the published Dutch of Europe, are compelled to teach the easier Taal. And literature of an excellent chara
U||cter is at the present moment growing up in South Africa in the Taal, which was only a few years ago, the common medium of speech between simple but brave rustics. If we have lost faith in our vernaculars, it is a sign of want of faith in ourselves; it is the surest sign of decay. And no scheme of self-government, however benevolently or generously it may be bestowed upon us, will ever make us a [Pg 10]self-governing nation, if we have no respect for the languages our mothers speak.

U||SWADESHI[3]
U||It was not without great diffidence that I undertook to speak to you at all. And I was hard put to it in the selection of my subject. I have chosen a very delicate and difficult subject. It is delicate because of the peculiar views I hold upon Swadeshi, and it is difficult because I have not that command of language which is necessary for giving adequate expression to my thoughts. I know that I may rely upon your indulgence for the many shortcomings you will no doubt find in my address, the more so when I tell you that there is nothing in what I am about to say that I am not either already practising or am not preparing to practise to the best of my ability. It encourages me to observe that last month you devoted a week to prayer in the place of an address. I have earnestly prayed that what I am about to say may bear fruit and I know that you will bless my word with a similar prayer.
U||After much thinking I have arrived at a definition of Swadeshi that, perhaps, best illustrates my meaning. Swadeshi is that spirit in us which restricts us to the use and service of our immediate surroundings to the exclusion of the more remote. Thus, as for religion, in order to satisfy the requirements of the definition, I must restrict myself to my ancestral religion. That is the use of my immediate religious surrounding. If I find it defective, I should serve it by purging it of its defects. In the domain of politics I should make use of the indigenous institutions and serve them by curing them of their proved defects. In that of economics I should use only things that are produced by my immediate[Pg 12] neighbours and serve those industries by making them efficient and complete where they might be found wanting. It is suggested that such Swadeshi, if reduced to practice, will lead to the millennium. And, as we do not abandon our pursuit after the millennium, because we do not expect quite to reach it wi
U||thin our times, so may we not abandon Swadeshi even though it may not be fully attained for generations to come.
U||Let us briefly examine the three branches of Swadeshi as sketched above. Hinduism has become a conservative religion and, therefore, a mighty force because of the Swadeshi spirit underlying it. It is the most tolerant because it is non-proselytising, and it is as capable of expansion today as it has been found to be in the past. It has succeeded not in driving out, as I think it has been erroneously held, but in absorbing Buddhism. By reason of the Swadeshi spirit, a Hindu refuses to change his religion, not necessarily because he considers it to be the best, but because he knows that he can complement it by introducing reforms. And what I have said about Hinduism is, I suppose, true of the other great faiths of the world, only it is held that it is specially so in the case of Hinduism. But here comes the point I am labouring to reach. If there is any substance in what I have said, will not the great missionary bodies of India, to whom she owes a deep debt of gratitude for what they have done and are doing, 
U||do still better and serve the spirit of Christianity better by dropping the goal of proselytising while continuing their philanthropic work? I hope you will not consider this to be an impertinence on my part. I make the suggestion in all sincerity and with due humility. Moreover I have some claim upon your attention. I have endeavoured to study the Bible. I consider it as part of my scriptures. The spirit of the Sermon on the Mount competes almost on equal terms with the Bhagavad Gita for the domination of my heart. I yield to no Christian in the strength of devotion[Pg 13] with which I sing "Lead kindly light" and several other inspired hymns of a similar nature. I have come under the influence of noted Christian missionaries belonging to different denominations. And enjoy to this day the privilege of friendship with some of them. You will perhaps, therefore, allow that I have offered the above suggestion not as a biased Hindu, but as a humble and impartial student of religion with great leanings towards Ch
U||ristianity. May it not be that "Go ye unto all the world" message has been somewhat narrowly interpreted and the spirit of it missed? It will not be denied, I speak from experience, that many of the conversions are only so-called. In some cases the appeal has gone not to the heart but to the stomach. And in every case a conversion leaves a sore behind it which, I venture to think, is avoidable. Quoting again from experience, a new birth, a change of heart, is perfectly possible in every one of the great faiths. I know I am now treading upon thin ice. But I do not apologise in closing this part of my subject, for saying that the frightful outrage that is just going on in Europe, perhaps shows that the message of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Peace, had been little understood in Europe, and that light upon it may have to be thrown from the East.
U||I have sought your help in religious matters, which it is yours to give in a special sense. But I make bold to seek it even in political matters. I do not believe that religion has nothing to do with politics. The latter divorced from religion is like a corpse only fit to be buried. As a matter of fact, in your own silent manner, you influence politics not a little. And I feel that, if the attempt to separate politics from religion had not been made as it is even now made, they would not have degenerated as they often appear to have done. No one considers that the political life of the country is in a happy state. Following out the Swadeshi spirit, I observe the indigenous institutions and the village panchayats hold me. India is really[Pg 14] a republican country, and it is because it is that, that it has survived every shock hitherto delivered. Princes and potentates, whether they were Indian born or foreigners, have hardly touched the vast masses except for collecting revenue. The latter in their turn see
U||m to have rendered unto Caesar what was Caesar's and for the rest have done much as they have liked. The vast organisation of caste answered not only the religious wants of the community, but it answered to its political needs. The villagers managed their internal affairs through the caste system, and through it they dealt with any oppression from the ruling power or powers. It is not possible to deny of a nation that was capable of producing the caste system its wonderful power of organisation. One had but to attend the great Kumbha Mela at Hardwar last year to know how skilful that organisation must have been, which without any seeming effort was able effectively to cater for more than a million pilgrims. Yet it is the fashion to say that we lack organising ability. This is true, I fear, to a certain extent, of those who have been nurtured in the new traditions. We have laboured under a terrible handicap owing to an almost fatal departure from the Swadeshi spirit. We, the educated classes, have received ou
U||r education through a foreign tongue. We have therefore not reacted upon the masses. We want to represent the masses, but we fail. They recognise us not much more than they recognise the English officers. Their hearts are an open book to neither. Their aspirations are not ours. Hence there is a break. And you witness not in reality failure to organise but want of correspondence between the representatives and the represented. If during the last fifty years we had been educated through the vernaculars, our elders and our servants and our neighbours would have partaken of our knowledge; the discoveries of a Bose or a Ray would have been household treasures as are the Ramayan and the Mahabharat. As it is, so far as the masses are concerned, those[Pg 15] great discoveries might as well have been made by foreigners. Had instruction in all the branches of learning been given through the vernaculars, I make bold to say that they would have been enriched wonderfully. The question of village sanitation, etc., would h
U||ave been solved long ago. The village panchayats would be now a living force in a special way, and India would almost be enjoying self-government suited to its requirements and would have been spared the humiliating spectacle of organised assassination on its sacred soil. It is not too late to mend. And you can help if you will, as no other body or bodies can.
U||And now for the last division of Swadeshi, much of the deep poverty of the masses is due to the ruinous departure from Swadeshi in the economic and industrial life. If not an article of commerce had been brought from outside India, she would be today a land flowing with milk and honey. But that was not to be. We were greedy and so was England. The connection between England and India was based clearly upon an error. But she does not remain in India in error. It is her declared policy that India is to be held in trust for her people. If this be true, Lancashire must stand aside. And if the Swadeshi doctrine is a sound doctrine, Lancashire can stand aside without hurt, though it may sustain a shock for the time being. I think of Swadeshi not as a boycott movement undertaken by way of revenge. I conceive it as religious principle to be followed by all. I am no economist, but I have read some treatises which show that England could easily become a self-sustained country, growing all the produce she needs. This m
U||ay be an utterly ridiculous proposition, and perhaps the best proof that it cannot be true, is that England is one of the largest importers in the world. But India cannot live for Lancashire or any other country before she is able to live for herself. And she can live for herself only if she produces and is helped to produce everything[Pg 16] for her requirements within her own borders. She need not be, she ought not to be, drawn into the vertex of mad and ruinous competition which breeds fratricide, jealousy and many other evils. But who is to stop her great millionaires from entering into the world competition? Certainly not legislation. Force of public opinion, proper education, however, can do a great deal in the desired direction. The hand-loom industry is in a dying condition. I took special care during my wanderings last year to see as many weavers as possible, and my heart ached to find how they had lost, how families had retired from this once flourishing and honourable occupation. If we follow the 
U||Swadeshi doctrine, it would be your duty and mine to find out neighbours who can supply our wants and to teach them to supply them where they do not know how to proceed, assuming that there are neighbours who are in want of healthy occupation. Then every village of India will almost be a self-supporting and self-contained unit, exchanging only such necessary commodities with other villages where they are not locally producible. This may all sound nonsensical. Well, India is a country of nonsense. It is nonsensical to parch one's throat with thirst when a kindly Mahomedan is ready to offer pure water to drink. And yet thousands of Hindus would rather die of thirst than drink water from a Mahomedan household. These nonsensical men can also, once they are convinced that their religion demands that they should wear garments manufactured in India only and eat food only grown in India, decline to wear any other clothing or eat any other food. Lord Curzon set the fashion for tea-drinking. And that pernicious drug n
U||ow bids fair to overwhelm the nation. It has already undermined the digestive apparatus of hundreds of thousands of men and women and constitutes an additional tax upon their slender purses. Lord Hardinge can set the fashion for Swadeshi, and almost the whole of India forswear foreign goods. There is a verse[Pg 17] in the Bhagavad Gita, which, freely rendered, means, masses follow the classes. It is easy to undo the evil if the thinking portion of the community were to take the Swadeshi vow even though it may, for a time, cause considerable inconvenience. I hate legislative interference, in any department of life. At best it is the lesser evil. But I would tolerate, welcome, indeed, plead for a stiff protective duty upon foreign goods. Natal, a British colony, protected its sugar by taxing the sugar that came from another British colony, Mauritius. England has sinned against India by forcing free trade upon her. It may have been food for her, but it has been poison for this country.
U||It has often been urged that India cannot adopt Swadeshi in the economic life at any rate. Those who advance this objection do not look upon Swadeshi as a rule of life. With them it is a mere patriotic effort not to be made if it involved any self-denial. Swadeshi, as defined here, is a religious discipline to be undergone in utter disregard of the physical discomfort it may cause to individuals. Under its spell the deprivation of a pin or a needle, because these are not manufactured in India, need cause no terror. A Swadeshist will learn to do without hundreds of things which today he considers necessary. Moreover, those who dismiss Swadeshi from their minds by arguing the impossible, forget that Swadeshi, after all, is a goal to be reached by steady effort. And we would be making for the goal even if we confined Swadeshi to a given set of articles allowing ourselves as a temporary measure to use such things as might not be procurable in the country.
U||There now remains for me to consider one more objection that has been raised against Swadeshi. The objectors consider it to be a most selfish doctrine without any warrant in the civilised code of morality. With them to practise Swadeshi is to revert to barbarism. I cannot enter into a detailed analysis of the position. But I would urge that Swadeshi[Pg 18] is the only doctrine consistent with the law of humility and love. It is arrogance to think of launching out to serve the whole of India when I am hardly able to serve even my own family. It were better to concentrate my effort upon the family and consider that through them I was serving the whole nation and, if you will, the whole of humanity. This is humility and it is love. The motive will determine the quality of the act. I may serve my family regardless of the sufferings I may cause to others. As for instance, I may accept an employment which enables me to extort money from people, I enrich myself thereby and then satisfy many unlawful demands of the 
U||family. Here I am neither serving the family nor the State. Or I may recognise that God has given me hands and feet only to work with for my sustenance and for that of those who may be dependent upon me. I would then at once simplify my life and that of those whom I can directly reach. In this instance I would have served the family without causing injury to anyone else. Supposing that everyone followed this mode of life, we should have at once an ideal state. All will not reach that state at the same time. But those of us who, realising its truth, enforce it in practice will clearly anticipate and accelerate the coming of that happy day. Under this plan of life, in seeming to serve India to the exclusion of every other country I do not harm any other country. My patriotism is both exclusive and inclusive. It is exclusive in the sense that in all humility I confine my attention to the land of my birth, but it is inclusive in the sense that my service is not of a competitive or antagonistic nature. Sic utere 
U||tuo ut alienum non la is not merely a legal maxim, but it is a grand doctrine of life. It is the key to a proper practice of Ahimsa or love. It is for you, the custodians of a great faith, to set the fashion and show, by your preaching, sanctified by practice, that patriotism based on hatred "killeth" and that patriotism based on love "giveth life."

U||AHIMSA[4]
U||There seems to be no historical warrant for the belief that an exaggerated practice of Ahimsa synchronises with our becoming bereft of manly virtues. During the past 1,500 years we have, as a nation, given ample proof of physical courage, but we have been torn by internal dissensions and have been dominated by love of self instead of love of country. We have, that is to say, been swayed by the spirit of irreligion rather than of religion.
U||I do not know how far the charge of unmanliness can be made good against the Jains. I hold no brief for them. By birth I am a Vaishnavite, and was taught Ahimsa in my childhood. I have derived much religious benefit from Jain religious works as I have from scriptures of the other great faiths of the world. I owe much to the living company of the deceased philosopher, Rajachand Kavi, who was a Jain by birth. Thus, though my views on Ahimsa are a result of my study of most of the faiths of the world, they are now no longer dependent upon the authority of these works. They are a part of my life, and, if I suddenly discovered that the religious books read by me bore a different interpretation from the one I had learnt to give them, I should still hold to the view of Ahimsa as I am about to set forth here.
U||Our Shastras seem to teach that a man who really practises Ahimsa in its fulness has the world at his feet; he so affects his surroundings that even the snakes and other venomous reptiles do him no harm. This is said to have been the experience of St. Francis of Assisi.
U||In its negative form it means not injuring any[Pg 20] living being whether by body or mind. It may not, therefore, hurt the person of any wrong-doer, or bear any ill-will to him and so cause him mental suffering. This statement does not cover suffering caused to the wrong-doer by natural acts of mine which do not proceed from ill-will. It, therefore, does not prevent me from withdrawing from his presence a child whom he, we shall imagine, is about to strike. Indeed, the proper practice of Ahimsa requires me to withdraw the intended victim from the wrong-doer, if I am, in any way whatsoever, the guardian of such a child. It was, therefore, most proper for the passive resisters of South Africa to have resisted the evil that the Union Government sought to do to them. They bore no ill-will to it. They showed this by helping the Government whenever it needed their help. Their resistance consisted of disobedience of the orders of the Government, even to the extent of suffering death at their hands. Ahimsa requires
U|| deliberate self-suffering, not a deliberate injuring of the supposed wrong-doer.
U||In its positive form, Ahimsa means the largest love, the greatest charity. If I am a follower of Ahimsa, I must love my enemy. I must apply the same rules to the wrong-doer who is my enemy or a stranger to me, as I would to my wrong-doing father or son. This active Ahimsa necessarily includes truth and fearlessness. As man cannot deceive the loved one, he does not fear or frighten him or her. Gift of life is the greatest of all gifts; a man who gives it in reality, disarms all hostility. He has paved the way for an honourable understanding. And none who is himself subject to fear can bestow that gift. He must, therefore, be himself fearless. A man cannot then practice Ahimsa and be a coward at the same time. The practice of Ahimsa calls forth the greatest courage. It is the most soldierly of a soldier's virtues. General Gordon has been represented in a famous statue as bearing only a stick. This takes us far on the road to Ahimsa. But a soldier, who needs the protection of even a stick, is[Pg 21] to that ext
U||ent so much the less a soldier. He is the true soldier who knows how to die and stand his ground in the midst of a hail of bullets. Such a one was Ambarisha, who stood his ground without lifting a finger though Duryasa did his worst. The Moors who were being pounded by the French gunners and who rushed to the guns' mouths with 'Allah' on their lips, showed much the same type of courage. Only theirs was the courage of desperation. Ambarisha's was due to love. Yet the Moorish valour, readiness to die, conquered the gunners. They frantically waved their hats, ceased firing, and greeted their erstwhile enemies as comrades. And so the South African passive resisters in their thousands were ready to die rather than sell their honour for a little personal ease. This was Ahimsa in its active form. It never barters away honour. A helpless girl in the hands of a follower of Ahimsa finds better and surer protection than in the hands of one who is prepared to defend her only to the point to which his weapons would carry
U|| him. The tyrant, in the first instance, will have to walk to his victim over the dead body of her defender; in the second, he has but to overpower the defender; for it is assumed that the cannon of propriety in the second instance will be satisfied when the defender has fought to the extent of his physical valour. In the first instance, as the defender has matched his very soul against the mere body of the tyrant, the odds are that the soul in the latter will be awakened, and the girl would stand an infinitely greater chance of her honour being protected than in any other conceivable circumstance, barring of course, that of her own personal courage.
U||If we are unmanly today, we are so, not because we do not know how to strike, but because we fear to die. He is no follower of Mahavira, the apostle of Jainism, or of Buddha or of the Vedas, who being afraid to die, takes flight before any danger, real or imaginary, all the while wishing that somebody else would remove the danger by destroying the[Pg 22] person causing it. He is no follower of Ahimsa who does not care a straw if he kills a man by inches by deceiving him in trade, or who would protect by force of arms a few cows and make away with the butcher or who, in order to do a supposed good to his country, does not mind killing off a few officials. All these are actuated by hatred, cowardice and fear. Here the love of the cow or the country is a vague thing intended to satisfy one's vanity, or soothe a stinging conscience.
U||Ahimsa truly understood is in my humble opinion a panacea for all evils mundane and extra-mundane. We can never overdo it. Just at present we are not doing it at all. Ahimsa does not displace the practice of other virtues, but renders their practice imperatively necessary before it can be practised even in its rudiments. Mahavira and Buddha were soldiers, and so was Tolstoy. Only they saw deeper and truer into their profession, and found the secret of a true, happy, honourable and godly life. Let us be joint sharers with these teachers, and this land of ours will once more be the abode of gods.

U||THE MORAL BASIS OF CO-OPERATION[5]
U||The only claim I have on your indulgence is that some months ago I attended with Mr. Ewbank a meeting of mill-hands to whom he wanted to explain the principles of co-operation. The chawl in which they were living was as filthy as it well could be. Recent rains had made matters worse. And I must frankly confess that, had it not been for Mr. Ewbank's great zeal for the cause he has made his own, I should have shirked the task. But there we were, seated on a fairly worn-out charpai, surrounded by men, women and children. Mr. Ewbank opened fire on a man who had put himself forward and who wore not a particularly innocent countenance. After he had engaged him and the other people about him in Gujrati conversation, he wanted me to speak to the people. Owing to the suspicious looks of the man who was first spoken to, I naturally pressed home the moralities of co-operation. I fancy that Mr. Ewbank rather liked the manner in which I handled the subject. Hence, I believe, his kind invitation to me to tax your patience
U|| for a few moments upon a consideration of co-operation from a moral standpoint.
U||My knowledge of the technicality of co-operation is next to nothing. My brother, Devadhar, has made the subject his own. Whatever he does, naturally attracts me and predisposes me to think that there must be something good in it and the handling of it must be fairly difficult. Mr. Ewbank very kindly placed at my disposal some literature too on the subject. And I have had a unique opportunity of watching the effect of some [Pg 24]co-operative effort in Champaran. I have gone through Mr. Ewbank's ten main points which are like the Commandments, and I have gone through the twelve points of Mr. Collins of Behar, which remind me of the law of the Twelve Tables. There are so-called agricultural banks in Champaran. They were to me disappointing efforts, if they were meant to be demonstrations of the success of co-operation. On the other hand, there is quiet work in the same direction being done by Mr. Hodge, a missionary whose efforts are leaving their impress on those who come in contact with him. Mr. Hodge is a c
U||o-operative enthusiast and probably considers that the result which he sees flowing from his efforts are due to the working of co-operation. I, who was able to watch the efforts, had no hesitation in inferring that the personal equation counted for success in the one and failure in the other instance.
U||I am an enthusiast myself, but twenty-five years of experimenting and experience have made me a cautious and discriminating enthusiast. Workers in a cause necessarily, though quite unconsciously, exaggerate its merits and often succeed in turning its very defects into advantages. In spite of my caution I consider the little institution I am conducting in Ahmedabad as the finest thing in the world. It alone gives me sufficient inspiration. Critics tell me that it represents a soulless soul-force and that its severe discipline has made it merely mechanical. I suppose both—the critics and I—are wrong. It is, at best, a humble attempt to place at the disposal of the nation a home where men and women may have scope for free and unfettered development of character, in keeping with the national genius, and, if its controllers do not take care, the discipline that is the foundation of character may frustrate the very end in view. I would venture, therefore, to warn enthusiasts in co-operation against entertainin
U||g false hopes.
U||With Sir Daniel Hamilton it has become a religion. On the 13th January last, he addressed the[Pg 25] students of the Scottish Churches College and, in order to point a moral, he instanced Scotland's poverty of two hundred years ago and showed how that great country was raised from a condition of poverty to plenty. "There were two powers, which raised her—the Scottish Church and the Scottish banks. The Church manufactured the men and the banks manufactured the money to give the men a start in life.... The Church disciplined the nation in the fear of God which is the beginning of wisdom and in the parish schools of the Church the children learned that the chief end of man's life was to glorify God and to enjoy Him for ever. Men were trained to believe in God and in themselves, and on the trustworthy character so created the Scottish banking system was built." Sir Daniel then shows that it was possible to build up the marvellous Scottish banking system only on the character so built. So far there can only be 
U||perfect agreement with Sir Daniel, for that 'without character there is no co-operation' is a sound maxim. But he would have us go much further. He thus waxes eloquent on co-operation: "Whatever may be your daydreams of India's future, never forget this that it is to weld India into one, and so enable her to take her rightful place in the world, that the British Government is here; and the welding hammer in the hand of the Government is the co-operative movement." In his opinion it is the panacea of all the evils that afflict India at the present moment. In its extended sense it can justify the claim on one condition which need not be mentioned here; in the limited sense in which Sir Daniel has used it, I venture to think, it is an enthusiast's exaggeration. Mark his peroration: "Credit, which is only Trust and Faith, is becoming more and more the money power of the world, and in the parchment bullet into which is impressed the faith which removes mountains, India will find victory and peace." Here there is 
U||evident confusion of thought. The credit which is becoming the money power of the world[Pg 26] has little moral basis and is not a synonym for Trust or Faith, which are purely moral qualities. After twenty years' experience of hundreds of men, who had dealings with banks in South Africa, the opinion I had so often heard expressed has become firmly rooted in me, that the greater the rascal the greater the credit he enjoys with his banks. The banks do not pry into his moral character: they are satisfied that he meets his overdrafts and promissory notes punctually. The credit system has encircled this beautiful globe of ours like a serpent's coil, and if we do not mind, it bids fair to crush us out of breath. I have witnessed the ruin of many a home through the system, and it has made no difference whether the credit was labelled co-operative or otherwise. The deadly coil has made possible the devastating spectacle in Europe, which we are helplessly looking on. It was perhaps never so true as it is today that, 
U||as in law so in war, the longest purse finally wins. I have ventured to give prominence to the current belief about credit system in order to emphasise the point that the co-operative movement will be a blessing to India only to the extent that it is a moral movement strictly directed by men fired with religious fervour. It follows, therefore, that co-operation should be confined to men wishing to be morally right, but failing to do so, because of grinding poverty or of the grip of the Mahajan. Facility for obtaining loans at fair rates will not make immoral men moral. But the wisdom of the Estate or philanthropists demands that they should help on the onward path, men struggling to be good.
U||Too often do we believe that material prosperity means moral growth. It is necessary that a movement which is fraught with so much good to India should not degenerate into one for merely advancing cheap loans. I was therefore delighted to read the recommendation in the Report of the Committee on Co-operation in India, that "they wish clearly to express their opinion that it is to true [Pg 27]co-operation alone, that is, to a co-operation which recognises the moral aspect of the question that Government must look for the amelioration of the masses and not to a pseudo-co-operative edifice, however imposing, which is built in ignorance of co-operative principles." With this standard before us, we will not measure the success of the movement by the number of co-operative societies formed, but by the moral condition of the co-operators. The registrars will, in that event, ensure the moral growth of existing societies before multiplying them. And the Government will make their promotion conditional, not upon the n
U||umber of societies they have registered, but the moral success of the existing institutions. This will mean tracing the course of every pie lent to the members. Those responsible for the proper conduct of co-operative societies will see to it that the money advanced does not find its way into the toddy-seller's bill or into the pockets of the keepers of gambling dens. I would excuse the rapacity of the Mahajan if it has succeeded in keeping the gambling die or toddy from the ryot's home.
U||A word perhaps about the Mahajan will not be out of place. Co-operation is not a new device. The ryots co-operate to drum out monkeys or birds that destroy their crops. They co-operate to use a common thrashing floor. I have found them co-operate to protect their cattle to the extent of their devoting the best land for the grazing of their cattle. And they have been found co-operating against a particular rapacious Mahajan. Doubts have been expressed as to the success of co-operation because of the tightness of the Mahajan's hold on the ryots. I do not share the fears. The mightiest Mahajan must, if he represent an evil force, bend before co-operation, conceived as an essentially moral movement. But my limited experience of the Mahajan of Champaran has made me revise the accepted opinion about his 'blighting influence.' I have found him to be not always[Pg 28] relentless, not always exacting of the last pie. He sometimes serves his clients in many ways and even comes to their rescue in the hour of their dist
U||ress. My observation is so limited that I dare not draw any conclusions from it, but I respectfully enquire whether it is not possible to make a serious effort to draw out the good in the Mahajan and help him or induce him to throw out the evil in him. May he not be induced to join the army of co-operation, or has experience proved that he is past praying for?
U||I note that the movement takes note of all indigenous industries. I beg publicly to express my gratitude to Government for helping me in my humble effort to improve the lot of the weaver. The experiment I am conducting shows that there is a vast field for work in this direction. No well-wisher of India, no patriot dare look upon the impending destruction of the hand-loom weaver with equanimity. As Dr. Mann has stated, this industry used to supply the peasant with an additional source of livelihood and an insurance against famine. Every registrar who will nurse back to life this important and graceful industry will earn the gratitude of India. My humble effort consists firstly in making researches as to the possibilities of simple reforms in the orthodox hand-looms, secondly, in weaning the educated youth from the craving for Government or other services and the feeling that education renders him unfit for independent occupation and inducing him to take to weaving as a calling as honourable as that of a barri
U||ster or a doctor, and thirdly by helping those weavers who have abandoned their occupation to revert to it. I will not weary the audience with any statement on the first two parts of the experiment. The third may be allowed a few sentences as it has a direct bearing upon the subject before us. I was able to enter upon it only six months ago. Five families that had left off the calling have reverted to it and they are doing a prosperous business. The Ashram supplies[Pg 29] them at their door with the yarn they need; its volunteers take delivery of the cloth woven, paying them cash at the market rate. The Ashram merely loses interest on the loan advanced for the yarn. It has as yet suffered no loss and is able to restrict its loss to a minimum by limiting the loan to a particular figure. All future transactions are strictly cash. We are able to command a ready sale for the cloth received. The loss of interest, therefore, on the transaction is negligible. I would like the audience to note its purely moral chara
U||cter from start to finish. The Ashram depends for its existence on such help as friends render it. We, therefore, can have no warrant for charging interest. The weavers could not be saddled with it. Whole families that were breaking to pieces are put together again. The use of the loan is pre-determined. And we, the middlemen, being volunteers, obtain the privilege of entering into the lives of these families, I hope, for their and our betterment. We cannot lift them without being lifted ourselves. This last relationship has not yet been developed, but we hope, at an early date, to take in hand the education too of these families and not rest satisfied till we have touched them at every point. This is not too ambitious a dream. God willing, it will be a reality some day. I have ventured to dilate upon the small experiment to illustrate what I mean by co-operation to present it to others for imitation. Let us be sure of our ideal. We shall ever fail to realise it, but we should never cease to strive for it. T
U||hen there need be no fear of "co-operation of scoundrels" that Ruskin so rightly dreaded.

U||NATIONAL DRESS[6]
U||I have hitherto successfully resisted to temptation of either answering your or Mr. Irwin's criticism of the humble work I am doing in Champaran. Nor am I going to succumb now except with regard to a matter which Mr. Irwin has thought fit to dwell upon and about which he has not even taken the trouble of being correctly informed. I refer to his remarks on my manner of dressing.
U||My "familiarity with the minor amenities of Western civilisation" has taught me to respect my national costume, and it may interest Mr. Irwin to know that the dress I wear in Champaran is the dress I have always worn in India except that for a very short period in India I fell an easy prey in common with the rest of my countrymen to the wearing of semi-European dress in the courts and elsewhere outside Kathiawar. I appeared before the Kathiawar courts now 21 years ago in precisely the dress I wear in Champaran.
U||One change I have made and it is that, having taken to the occupation of weaving and agriculture and having taken the vow of Swadeshi, my clothing is now entirely hand-woven and hand-sewn and made by me or my fellow workers. Mr. Irwin's letter suggests that I appear before the ryots in a dress I have temporarily and specially adopted in Champaran to produce an effect. The fact is that I wear the national dress because it is the most natural and the most becoming for an Indian. I believe that our copying of the European dress is a sign of our degradation, humiliation and our weakness, and that we are committing a national sin in discarding a dress which is best suited to the Indian[Pg 31] climate and which, for its simplicity, art and cheapness, is not to be beaten on the face of the earth and which answers hygienic requirements. Had it not been for a false pride and equally false notions of prestige, Englishmen here would long ago have adopted the Indian costume. I may mention incidentally that I do not go a
U||bout Champaran bare headed. I do avoid shoes for sacred reasons. But I find too that it is more natural and healthier to avoid them whenever possible.
U||I am sorry to inform Mr. Irwin and your readers that my esteemed friend Babu Brijakishore Prasad, the "ex-Hon. Member of Council," still remains unregenerate and retains the provincial cap and never walks barefoot and "kicks up" a terrible noise even in the house we are living in by wearing wooden sandals. He has still not the courage, in spite of most admirable contact with me, to discard his semi-anglicised dress and whenever he goes to see officials he puts his legs into the bifurcated garment and on his own admission tortures himself by cramping his feet in inelastic shoes. I cannot induce him to believe that his clients won't desert him and the courts won't punish him if he wore his more becoming and less expensive dhoti. I invite you and Mr. Irwin not to believe the "stories" that the latter hears about me and my friends, but to join me in the crusade against educated Indians abandoning their manners, habits and customs which are not proved to be bad or harmful. Finally I venture to warn you and Mr. Ir
U||win that you and he will ill-serve the cause both of you consider is in danger by reason of my presence in Champaran if you continue, as you have done, to base your strictures on unproved facts. I ask you to accept my assurance that I should deem myself unworthy of the friendship and confidence of hundreds of my English friends and associates—not all of them fellow cranks—if in similar circumstances I acted towards them differently from my own countrymen.

U||The immediate need
U||    To be in subjection to a band of foreign rulers, if Seeley's historical maxim is true, cannot but lead to national deterioration. This is why the need for independence is so immediate.

The sheer weight of numbers,—three hundred and twenty millions against a few thousands,—is so great, that if these numbers could once speak with one mind, their will must be carried out.

U||NOTE
U||The doctrine of violence is more widely believed in than is generally realised. The votaries of violence can be divided into two classes. Some, a small and dwindling class, believe in it and are prepared to act according to their faith. Others, a very large class always, and now, after bitter experiences of the failure of constitutional agitation, larger than ever, believe in violence, but that belief does not lead them to action. It disables them from work on any basis other than force. The belief in violence serves to dissuade them from all other kinds of work or sacrifice. In both cases the evil is great.
U||There can be no reconstruction or hope for this land of ours, unless we eradicate the worship of force in all its forms, and establish work on a basis other than violence. A refutation of the doctrine of violence is, in the present situation of the affairs of our country, more necessary than ever.
U||To this end, nothing better can be conceived than the publication and wide distribution of Mr. Gandhi's famous book.
U||It was extremely patriotic of Messrs. Ganesh and Company to have readily agreed to undertake the work when they were approached with the request.

U||FOREWORD
U||I have re-read this booklet more than once. The value at the present moment lies in re-printing it as it is. But if I had to revise it, there is only one word I would alter in accordance with a promise made to an English friend. She took exception to my use of the word 'prostitute' in speaking of the Parliament. Her fine taste recoiled from the indelicacy of the expression. I remind the reader that the booklet purports to be a free translation of the original which is in Gujarati.
U||After years of endeavour to put into practice the views expressed in the following pages, I feel that the way shown therein is the only true way to Swaraj. Satyagrah—the law of love is the Law of life. Departure from it leads to disintegration. A firm adherence to it leads to regeneration.

U||HIND SWARAJ
U||OR
U||THE INDIAN HOME RULE
U||Reply to Critics
U||It is certainly my good fortune that this booklet of mine is receiving wide attention. The original is in Gujarati. It had a chequered career. It was first published in the columns of the 'Indian Opinion' of South Africa. It was written in 1908 during my return voyage from London to South Africa in answer to the Indian school of violence, and its prototype in South Africa. I came in contact with every known Indian anarchist in London. Their bravery impressed me, but I feel that their zeal was misguided. I felt that violence was no remedy for India's ills, and that her civilization required the use of a different and higher weapon for self-protection. The Satyagrah of South Africa was still an infant hardly two years old. But it had developed sufficiently to permit me to write of it with some degree of confidence. It[Pg 6] was so much appreciated that it was published as a booklet. It attracted some attention in India. The Bombay Government prohibited its circulation. I replied by publishing its translation. 
U||I thought that it was due to my English friends that they should know its contents. In my opinion it is a book which can be put into the hands of a child. It teaches the gospel of love in the place of that of hate. It replaces violence with self-sacrifice. It pits soul force against brute force. It has gone through several editions and I commend it to those who would care to read it. I withdraw nothing except one word of it, and that in deference to a lady friend. I have given the reason for the alteration in the preface to the Indian edition.
U||The booklet is a severe condemnation of 'modern civilization.' It was written in 1908. My conviction is deeper to-day than ever. I feel that if India would discard 'modern civilization' she can only gain by doing so.
U||But I would warn the reader against thinking that I am to-day aiming at the Swaraj described therein. I know that India is not ripe for it. It may seem an impertinence to[Pg 7] say so. But such is my conviction. I am individually working for the self-rule pictured therein. But to-day my corporate activity is undoubtedly devoted to the attainment of Parliamentary Swaraj in accordance with the wishes of the people of India. I am not aiming at destroying railways or hospitals, though I would certainly welcome their natural destruction. Neither railways nor hospitals are a test of a high and pure civilization. At best they are a necessary evil. Neither adds one inch to the moral stature of a nation. Nor am I aiming at a permanent destruction of law courts, much as I regard it as a 'consummation devoutly to be wished for.' Still less am I trying to destroy all machinery and mills. It requires a higher simplicity and renunciation than the people are to-day prepared for.
U||The only part of the programme which is now being carried out in its entirety is that of non-violence. But I regret to have to confess that even that is not being carried out in the spirit of the book. If it were, India would establish Swaraj in a day. If India adopted the doctrine of love as an active part of her religion and introduced it in her politics, Swaraj[Pg 8] would descend upon India from heaven. But I am painfully aware that that event is far off as yet.
U||I offer these comments because I observe that much is being quoted from the booklet to discredit the present movement. I have even seen writings suggesting that I am playing a deep game, that I am using the present turmoil to foist my fads on India, and am making religious experiments at India's expense. I can only answer that Satyagrah is made of sterner stuff. There is nothing reserved and nothing secret in it. A portion of the whole theory of life described in 'Hind Swaraj' is undoubtedly being carried into practice. There is no danger attendant upon the whole of it being practised. But it is not right to scare away people by reproducing from my writings passages that are irrelevant to the issue before the country.

U||INDIAN HOME RULE
U||CHAPTER I
U||The Congress and Its Officials
U||Reader: Just at present there is a Home Rule wave passing over India. All our countrymen appear to be pining for National Independence. A similar spirit pervades them even in South Africa. Indians seem to be eager after acquiring rights. Will you explain your views in this matter?
U||Editor: You have well put the question, but the answer is not easy. One of the objects of a newspaper is to understand the popular feeling and to give expression to it; another is to arouse among the people certain desirable sentiments; and the third is fearlessly to expose popular defects. The exercise of all these three functions is involved in answering your question. To a certain extent the people's will has to be expressed; certain sentiments will need to be fostered, and defects will have to be brought to light. But, as you have asked the question, it is my duty to answer it.
U||Reader: Do you then consider that a desire for Home Rule has been created among us?[Pg 12]
U||Editor: That desire gave rise to the National Congress. The choice of the word "National" implies it.
U||Reader: That, surely, is not the case. Young India seems to ignore the Congress. It is considered to be an instrument for perpetuating British Rule.
U||Editor: That opinion is not justified. Had not the Grand Old Man of India prepared the soil, our young men could not have even spoken about Home Rule. How can we forget what Mr. Hume has written, how he has lashed us into action, and with what effort he has awakened us, in order to achieve the objects of the Congress? Sir William Wedderburn has given his body, mind and money to the same cause. His writings are worthy of perusal to this day. Professor Gokhale, in order to prepare the Nation, embraced poverty and gave twenty years of his life. Even now, he is living in poverty. The late Justice Buddrudin Tyebji was also one of those who, through the Congress, sowed the seed of Home Rule. Similarly in Bengal, Madras, the Punjab and other places, there have been lovers of India and members of the Congress, both Indian and English.
U||Reader: Stay, stay, you are going too far, you are straying away from my question. I have asked you about Home or Self-Rule; you are discussing[Pg 13] foreign rule. I do not desire to hear English names, and you are giving me such names. In these circumstances, I do not think we can ever meet. I shall be pleased if you will confine yourself to Home Rule. All other wise talk will not satisfy me.
U||Editor: You are impatient. I cannot afford to be likewise. If you will bear with me for a while, I think you will find that you will obtain what you want. Remember the old proverb that the tree does not grow in one day. The fact that you have checked me, and that you do not want to hear about the well-wishers of India, shows that, for you at any rate, Home Rule is yet far away. If we had many like you, we would never make any advance. This thought is worthy of your attention.
U||Reader: It seems to me that you simply want to put me off by talking round and round. Those whom you consider to be well-wishers of India are not such in my estimation. Why, then, should I listen to your discourse on such people? What has he whom you consider to be the father of the nation done for it? He says that the English Governors will do justice, and that we should co-operate with them.
U||Editor: I must tell you with all gentleness that it must be a matter of shame for us that you should speak about that great man, in terms of disrespect. Just look at his work. He has dedicated his life to the service of India. We have learned[Pg 14] what we know from him. It was the respected Dadabhai who taught us that the English had sucked our life-blood. What does it matter that, to-day, his trust is still in the English nation? Is Dadabhai less to be honoured because, in the exuberance of youth, we are prepared to go a step further? Are we, on that account, wiser than he? It is a mark of wisdom not to kick against the very step from which we have risen higher. The removal of a step from a staircase brings down the whole of it. When, out of infancy we grow into youth, we do not despise infancy, but, on the contrary, we recall with affection the days of our childhood. If, after many years of study, a teacher were to teach me something, and if I were to build a little more on the foundation laid by that te
U||acher, I would not, on that account, be considered wiser than the teacher. He would always command my respect. Such is the case with the Grand Old Man of India. We must admit that he is the author of Nationalism.
U||Reader: You have spoken well. I can now understand that we must look upon Mr. Dadabhai with respect. Without him and men like him, we would probably not have the spirit that fires us. How can the same be said of Professor Gokhale? He has constituted himself a great friend of the English; he says that we have to learn a great deal from them, that we have to learn their political[Pg 15] wisdom, before we can talk of Home Rule. I am tired of reading his speeches.
U||Editor: If you are tired, it only betrays your impatience. We believe that those who are discontented with the slowness of their parents, and are angry because the parents would not run with their children, are considered disrespectful to their parents. Professor Gokhale occupies the place of a parent. What does it matter if he cannot run with us? A nation that is desirous of securing Home Rule cannot afford to despise its ancestors. We shall become useless if we lack respect for our elders. Only men with mature thoughts are capable of ruling themselves and not the hasty-tempered. Moreover, how many Indians were there like Professor Gokhale, when he gave himself to Indian education? I verily believe that whatever Professor Gokhale does he does with pure motives and with a view to serving India. His devotion to the Motherland is so great, that he would give his life for it if necessary. Whatever he says is said not to flatter anyone but because he believes it to be true. We are bound, therefore, to entertain 
U||the highest regard for him.
U||Reader: Are we, then, to follow him in every respect?
U||Editor: I never said any such thing. If we conscientiously differed from him, the learned Professor himself would advise us to follow the dictates of our conscience rather than him. Our chief[Pg 16] purpose is not to cry down his work, but to believe that he is infinitely greater than we, and to feel assured that compared with his work for India, ours is infinitesimal. Several newspapers write disrespectfully of him. It is our duty to protest against such writings. We should consider men like Professor Gokhale to be the pillars of Home Rule. It is a bad habit to say that another man's thoughts are bad and ours only are good, and that those holding different views from ours are the enemies of the country.
U||Reader: I now begin to understand somewhat your meaning. I shall have to think the matter over, but what you say about Mr. Hume and Sir William Wedderburn is beyond comprehension.
U||Editor: The same rule holds good for the English as for the Indians. I can never subscribe to the statement that all Englishmen are bad. Many Englishmen desire Home Rule for India. That the English people are somewhat more selfish than others is true, but that does not prove that every Englishman is bad. We who seek justice will have to do justice to others. Sir William does not wish ill to India—that should be enough for us. As we proceed, you will see that, if we act justly, India will be sooner free. You will see, too, that, if we shun every Englishman as an enemy, Home Rule will be delayed. But if we are just to them, we[Pg 17] shall receive their support in our progress towards the goal.
U||Reader: All this seems to me at present to be simply nonsensical. English support and the obtaining of Home Rule are two contradictory things. How can the English people tolerate Home Rule for us? But I do not want you to decide this question for me just yet. To pass time over it is useless. When you have shown how we can have Home Rule, perhaps I shall understand your views. You have prejudiced me against you by discoursing on English help. I would, therefore, beseech you not to continue this subject.
U||Editor: I have no desire to do so. That you are prejudiced against me is not a matter for much anxiety. It is well that I should say unpleasant things at the commencement, it is my duty patiently to try to remove your prejudice.
U||Reader: I like that last statement. It emboldens me to say what I like. One thing still puzzles me. I do not understand how the Congress laid the foundation of Home Rule.
U||Editor: Let us see. The Congress brought together Indians from different parts of India, and enthused us with the idea of Nationality. The Government used to look upon it with disfavour. The Congress has always insisted that the Nation should control revenue and expenditure. It has always desired self-government after the Canadian[Pg 18] model. Whether we can get it or not, whether we desire it or not, and whether there is not something more desirable, are different questions. All I have to show is that the Congress gave us a foretaste of Home Rule. To deprive it of the honour is not proper, and for us to do so would not only be ungrateful, but retard the fulfilment of our object. To treat the Congress as an institution inimical to our growth as a Nation would disable us from using that body.
U||CHAPTER II
U||The Partition of Bengal
U||Reader: Considering the matter as you put it, it seems proper to say that the foundation of Home Rule was laid by the Congress. But you will admit that it cannot be considered a real awakening. When and how did the awakening take place?
U||Editor: The seed is never seen. It works underneath the ground, is itself destroyed, and the tree which rises above the ground is alone seen. Such is the case with the Congress. Yet, what you call the real awakening took place after the Partition of Bengal. For this we have to be thankful to Lord Curzon. At the time of the Partition, the people of Bengal reasoned with Lord Curzon, but, in the pride of power, he[Pg 19] disregarded all their prayers—he took it for granted that Indians could only prattle, that they could never take any effective steps. He used insulting language, and, in the teeth of all opposition, partitioned Bengal. That day may be considered to be the day of the partition of the British Empire. The shock that the British power received through the Partition has never been equalled by any other act. This does not mean that the other injustices done to India are less glaring than that done by the Partition. The salt-tax is not a small injustice. We shall see many such things later on. But t
U||he people were ready to resist the Partition. At that time, the feeling ran high. Many leading Bengalis were ready to lose their all. They knew their power; hence the conflagration. It is now well nigh unquenchable; it is not necessary to quench it either. Partition will go, Bengal will be re-united, but the rift in the English barque will remain: it must daily widen. India awakened is not likely to fall asleep. Demand for abrogation of Partition is tantamount to demand for Home Rule. Leaders in Bengal know this, British officials realise it. That is why Partition still remains. As time passes, the Nation is being forged. Nations are not formed in a day; the formation requires years.
U||Reader: What, in your opinion, are the results of Partition?
U||Editor: Hitherto we have considered that for[Pg 20] redress of grievances, we must approach the Throne and, if we get no redress, we must sit still, except that we may still petition. After the Partition, people saw that petitions must be backed up by force, and that they must be capable of suffering. This new spirit must be considered to be the chief result of Partition. That spirit was seen in the outspoken writings in the press. That which the people said tremblingly and in secret began to be said and to be written publicly. The Swadeshi movement was inaugurated. People, young and old, used to run away at the sight of an English face; it now no longer awed them. They did not fear even a row, or being imprisoned. Some of the best sons of India are at present in banishment. This is something different from mere petitioning. Thus are the people moved. The spirit generated in Bengal has spread in the North to the Punjab, and in the South to Cape Comorin.
U||Reader: Do you suggest any other striking result?
U||Editor: The Partition has not only made a rift in the English ship, but has made it in ours also. Great events always produce great results. Our leaders are divided into two parties: the Moderates and the Extremists. These may be considered as the slow party and the impatient party. Some call the Moderates the timid party, and the Extremists the bold party. All interpret[Pg 21] the two words according to their pre-conceptions. This much is certain—that there has arisen an enmity between the two. The one distrusts the other, and imputes motives. At the time of the Surat Congress, there was almost a fight. I think that this division is not a good thing for the country, but I think also that such divisions will not last long. It all depends upon the leaders how long they will last.
U||CHAPTER III
U||Discontent and Unrest
U||Reader: Then you consider Partition to be a cause of the awakening? Do you welcome the unrest which has resulted from it?
U||Editor: When a man rises from sleep, he twists his limbs and is restless. It takes some time before he is entirely awakened. Similarly, although the Partition has caused an awakening, the comatose has not yet disappeared. We are still twisting our limbs and still restless, and just as the state between sleep and awakening must be considered to be necessary, so may the present unrest in India be considered a necessary and, therefore, a proper state. The knowledge that there is unrest will, it is highly probable, enable us to outgrow it. Rising from sleep, we do not continue in a comatose state, but, according to our ability, sooner or later, we[Pg 22] are completely restored to our senses. So shall we be free from the present unrest which no one likes.
U||Reader: What is the other form of unrest?
U||Editor: Unrest is, in reality, discontent. The latter is only now described as unrest. During the Congress-period it was labelled discontent; Mr. Hume always said that the spread of discontent in India was necessary. This discontent is a very useful thing. So long as a man is contented with his present lot, so long is it difficult to persuade him to come out of it. Therefore it is that every reform must be preceded by discontent. We throw away things we have only when we cease to like them. Such discontent has been produced among us after reading the great works of Indians and Englishmen. Discontent has led to unrest, and the latter has brought about many deaths, many imprisonments, many banishments. Such a state of things will still continue. It must be so. All these may be considered good signs, but they may also lead to bad results.
U||CHAPTER IV
U||What is Swaraj?
U||Reader: I have now learnt what the Congress has done to make India one nation, how the Partition has caused an awakening, and how discontent and unrest have spread through the land. I would[Pg 23] now like to know your views on Swaraj. I fear that our interpretation is not the same.
U||Editor: It is quite possible that we do not attach the same meaning to the term. You and I and all Indians are impatient to obtain Swaraj, but we are certainly not decided as to what it is. To drive the English out of India is a thought heard from many mouths, but it does not seem that many have properly considered why it should be so. I must ask you a question. Do you think that it is necessary to drive away the English, if we get all we want?
U||Reader: I should ask of them only one thing that is: "Please leave our country." If after they have complied with this request, their withdrawal from India means that they are still in India, I should have no objection. Then we would understand that, in our language, the word "gone" is equivalent to "remained."
U||Editor: Well then, let us suppose that the English have retired. What will you do then?
U||Reader: That question cannot be answered at this stage. The state after withdrawal will depend largely upon the manner of it. If, as you assume, they retire, it seems to me we shall still keep their constitution, and shall carry on the government. If they simply retire for the asking, we should have an army, etc. ready at hand. We[Pg 24] should, therefore, have no difficulty in carrying on the government.
U||Editor: You may think so: I do not. But I will not discuss the matter just now. I have to answer your question, and that I can do well by asking you several questions. Why do you want to drive away the English?
U||Reader: Because India has become impoverished by their government. They take away our money from year to year. The most important posts are reserved for themselves. We are kept in a state of slavery. They behave insolently towards us, and disregard our feelings.
U||Editor: If they do not take our money away, become gentle, and give us responsible posts, would you still consider their presence to be harmful?
U||Reader: That question is useless. It is similar to the question whether there is any harm in associating with a tiger, if he changes his nature. Such a question is sheer waste of time. When a tiger changes his nature, Englishmen will change theirs. This is not possible, and to believe it to be possible is contrary to human experience.
U||Editor: Supposing we get self-government similar to what the Canadians and the South Africans have, will it be good enough?
U||Reader: That question also is useless. We may get it when we have the same powers; we shall then hoist our own flag. As is Japan, so[Pg 25] must India be. We must own our navy, our army, and we must have our own splendour, and then will India's voice ring through the world.
U||Editor: You have well drawn the picture. In effect it means this: that we want English rule without the Englishman. You want the tiger's nature, but not the tiger; that is to say, you would make India English, and when it becomes English, it will be called not Hindustan but Englistan. This is not the Swaraj that I want.
U||Reader: I have placed before you my idea of Swaraj as I think it should be. If the education we have received be of any use, if the works of Spencer, Mill and others be of any importance and if the English Parliament be the mother of Parliaments, I certainly think that we should copy the English people and this to such an extent that, just as they do not allow others to obtain a footing in their country, so we should not allow them or others to obtain it in ours. What they have done in their own country has not been done in any other country. It is, therefore, proper for us to import their institutions. But now I want to know your views.
U||Editor: There is need for patience. My views will develop of themselves in the course of this discourse. It is as difficult for me to understand the true nature of Swaraj as it seems to you to be easy. I shall, therefore, for the time being, content[Pg 26] myself with endeavouring to show that what you call Swaraj is not truly Swaraj.
U||CHAPTER V
U||The Condition of England
U||Reader: Then from your statement, I deduce the Government of England is not desirable and not worth copying by us.
U||Editor: Your deduction is justified. The condition of England at present is pitiable. I pray to God that India may never be in that plight. That which you consider to be the Mother of Parliaments is like a sterile woman and a prostitute. Both these are harsh terms, but exactly fit the case. That Parliament has not yet of its own accord done a single good thing, hence I have compared it to a sterile woman. The natural condition of that Parliament is such that, without outside pressure, it can do nothing. It is like a prostitute because it is under the control of ministers who change from time to time. To-day it is under Mr. Asquith, to-morrow it may be under Mr. Balfour.
U||Reader: You have said this sarcastically. The term "sterile woman" is not applicable. The Parliament, being elected by the people, must work under public pressure. This is its quality.
U||Editor: You are mistaken. Let us examine it a little more closely. The best men are supposed[Pg 27] to be elected by the people. The members serve without pay and, therefore, it must be assumed only for the public weal. The electors are considered to be educated and, therefore, we should assume that they would not generally make mistakes in their choice. Such a Parliament should not need the spur of petitions or any other pressure. Its work should be so smooth that its effect would be more apparent day by day. But, as a matter of fact, it is generally acknowledged that the members are hypocritical and selfish. Each thinks of his own little interest. It is fear that is the guiding motive. What is done to-day may be undone to-morrow. It is not possible to recall a single instance in which the finality can be predicted for its work. When the greatest questions are debated its members have been seen to stretch themselves and to dose. Sometimes the members talk away until the listeners are disgusted. Carlyle has 
U||called it the "talking shop of the world." Members vote for their party without a thought. Their so-called discipline binds them to it. If any member, by way of exception, gives an independent vote, he is considered a renegade. If the money and the time wasted by the Parliament were entrusted to a few good men, the English nation would be occupying to-day a much higher platform. The Parliament is simply a costly toy of the nation. These views are, by no means, peculiar to me. Some great English thinkers have[Pg 28] expressed them. One of the members of the Parliament recently said that a true Christian could not become a member of it. Another said that it was a baby. And, if it has remained a baby after an existence of seven hundred years, when will it outgrow its babyhood?
U||Reader: You have set me thinking; you do not expect me to accept at once all you say. You give me entirely novel views. I shall have to digest them. Will you now explain the epithet "prostitute"?
U||Editor: That you cannot accept my views at once is only right. If you will read the literature on this subject, you will have some idea of it. The Parliament is without a real master. Under the Prime Minister, its movement is not steady, but it is buffeted about like a prostitute. The Prime Minister is more concerned about his power than about the welfare of the Parliament. His energy is concentrated upon securing the success of his party. His care is not always that the Parliament shall do right. Prime Ministers are known to have made the Parliament do things merely for party advantage. All this is worth thinking over.
U||Reader: Then you are really attacking the very men whom we have hitherto considered to be patriotic and honest?
U||Editor: Yes, that is true; I can have nothing against Prime Ministers, but what I have seen leads[Pg 29] me to think that they cannot be considered really patriotic. If they are to be considered honest because they do not take what is generally known as bribery, let them be so considered, but they are open to subtler influences. In order to gain their ends, they certainly bribe people with honours. I do not hesitate to say that they have neither real honesty nor a living conscience.
U||Reader: As you express these views about the Parliament, I would like to hear you on the English people, so that I may have your views of their Government.
U||Editor: To the English voters their newspaper is their Bible. They take cue from their newspapers, which latter are often dishonest. The same fact is differently interpreted by different newspapers, according to the party in whose interests they are edited. One newspaper would consider a great Englishman to be a paragon of honesty, another would consider him dishonest. What must be the condition of the people whose newspapers are of this type?
U||Reader: You shall describe it.
U||Editor: These people change their views frequently. It is said that they change them every seven years. These views swing like the pendulum of a clock and are never steadfast. The people would follow a powerful orator or a man who gives them parties, receptions, etc. As are the people, so[Pg 30] is their Parliament. They have certainly one quality very strongly developed. They will never allow their country to be lost. If any person were to cast an evil eye on it, they would pluck out his eyes. But that does not mean that the nation possesses every other virtue or that it should be imitated. If India copies England, it is my firm conviction that she will be ruined.
U||Reader: To what do you ascribe this state of England?
U||Editor: It is not due to any peculiar fault of the English people, but the condition is due to modern civilization. It is a civilization only in name. Under it the nations of Europe are becoming degraded and ruined day by day.
U||CHAPTER VI
U||Civilization
U||Reader: Now you will have to explain what you mean by civilization.
U||Editor: It is not a question of what I mean. Several English writers refuse to call that, civilization which passes under that name. Many books have been written upon that subject. Societies have been formed to cure the nation of the evils of civilization. A great English writer has written a work called "Civilization: Its Cause and Cure." Therein he has called it a disease.[Pg 31]
U||Reader: Why do we not know this generally?
U||Editor: The answer is very simple. We rarely find people arguing against themselves. Those who are intoxicated by modern civilization are not likely to write against it. Their care will be to find out facts and arguments in support of it, and this they do unconsciously, believing it to be true. A man, whilst he is dreaming, believes in his dream; he is undeceived only when he is awakened from his sleep. A man labouring under the bane of civilization is like a dreaming man. What we usually read are the work of defenders of modern civilization, which undoubtedly claims among its votaries very brilliant and even some very good men. Their writings hypnotise us. And so, one by one, we are drawn into the vortex.
U||Reader: This seems to be very plausible. Now will you tell me something of what you have read and thought of this civilization.
U||Editor: Let us first consider what state of things is described by the word "civilization." Its true test lies in the fact that people living in it make bodily welfare the object of life. We will take some examples. The people of Europe to-day live in better-built houses than they did a hundred years ago. This is considered an emblem of civilization, and this is also a matter to promote bodily happiness. Formerly, they wore skins, and used as their weapons spears. Now, they wear[Pg 32] long trousers, and for embellishing their bodies they wear a variety of clothing, and, instead of spears, they carry with them revolvers containing five or more chambers. If people of a certain country, who have hitherto not been in the habit of wearing much clothing, boots, etc., adopt European clothing, they are supposed to have become civilised out of savagery. Formerly, in Europe, people ploughed their lands mainly by manual labour. Now, one man can plough a vast tract by means of steam-engines, and can thus amass great we
U||alth. This is called a sign of civilization. Formerly, the fewest men wrote books, that were most valuable. Now, anybody writes and prints anything he likes and poisons people's minds. Formerly, men travelled in waggons; now they fly through the air, in trains at the rate of four hundred and more miles per day. This is considered the height of civilization. It has been stated that, as men progress, they shall be able to travel in airships and reach any part of the world in a few hours. Men will not need the use of their hands and feet. They will press a button, and they will have their clothing by their side. They will press another button, and they will have their newspaper. A third, and a motor-car will be in waiting for them. They will have a variety of delicately dished up food. Everything will be done by machinery. Formerly, when people wanted to fight with one another, they[Pg 33] measured between them their bodily strength; now it is possible to take away thousands of lives by one man working behind a
U|| gun from a hill. This is civilization. Formerly, men worked in the open air only so much as they liked. Now, thousands of workmen meet together and for the sake of maintenance work in factories or mines. Their condition is worse than that of beasts. They are obliged to work, at the risk of their lives, at most dangerous occupations, for the sake of millionaires. Formerly, men were made slaves under physical compulsion, now they are enslaved by temptation of money and of the luxuries that money can buy. There are now diseases of which people never dreamt before, and an army of doctors is engaged in finding out their cures, and so hospitals have increased. This is a test of civilization. Formerly, special messengers were required and much expense was incurred in order to send letters; to-day, anyone can abuse his fellow by means of a letter for one penny. True, at the same cost, one can send one's thanks also. Formerly, people had two or three meals consisting of homemade bread and vegetables; now, they requi
U||re something to eat every two hours, so that they have hardly leisure for anything else. What more need I say? All this you can ascertain from several authoritative books. These are all true tests of civilization. And, if any one speaks to the contrary,[Pg 34] know that he is ignorant. This civilization takes note neither of morality nor of religion. Its votaries calmly state that their business is not to teach religion. Some even consider it to be a superstitious growth. Others put on the cloak of religion, and prate about morality. But, after twenty years' experience, I have come to the conclusion that immorality is often taught in the name of morality. Even a child can understand that in all I have described above there can be no inducement to morality. Civilization seeks to increase bodily comforts, and it fails miserably even in doing so.
U||This civilization is irreligion, and it has taken such a hold on the people in Europe that those who are in it appear to be half mad. They lack real physical strength or courage. They keep up their energy by intoxication. They can hardly be happy in solitude. Women, who should be the queens of households, wander in the streets, or they slave away in factories. For the sake of a pittance, half a million women in England alone are labouring under trying circumstances in factories or similar institutions. This awful fact is one of the causes of the daily growing suffragette movement.
U||This civilization is such that one has only to be patient and it will be self-destroyed. According to the teaching of Mahomed this would be considered a Satanic civilization. Hinduism calls it the Black Age. I cannot give you an adequate concep[Pg 35]tion of it. It is eating into the vitals of the English nation. It must be shunned. Parliament are really emblems of slavery. If you will sufficiently think over this, you will entertain the same opinion, and cease to blame the English. They rather deserve our sympathy. They are a shrewd nation and I therefore believe that they will cast off the evil. They are enterprising and industrious and their mode of thought is not inherently immoral. Neither are they bad at heart. I, therefore, respect them. Civilization is not an incurable disease, but it should never be forgotten that the English people are at present afflicted by it.
U||CHAPTER VII
U||Why was India Lost?
U||Reader: You have said much about civilization—enough to make me ponder over it. I do not now know what I should adopt and what I should avoid from the nations of Europe, but one question comes to my lips immediately. If civilization is a disease, and if it has attacked England why has she been able to take India, and why is she able to retain it?
U||Editor: Your question is not very difficult to answer, and we shall presently be able to examine the true nature of Swaraj; for I am aware that I have still to answer that question. I will,[Pg 36] however, take up your previous question. The English have not taken India; we have given it to them. They are not in India because of their strength, but because we keep them. Let us now see whether these propositions can be sustained. They came to our country originally for purposes of trade. Recall the Company Bahadur. Who made it Bahadur? They had not the slightest intention at the time of establishing a kingdom. Who assisted the Company's officers? Who was tempted at the sight of their silver? Who bought their goods? History testifies that we did all this. In order to become rich all at once, we welcomed the Company's officers with open arms. We assisted them. If I am in the habit of drinking Bhang and a seller thereof sells it to me, am I to blame him or myself? By blaming the seller shall I be able to avoid t
U||he habit? And, if a particular retailer is driven away, will not another take his place? A true servant of India will have to go to the root of the matter. If an excess of food has caused me indigestion, I will certainly not avoid it by blaming water. He is a true physician who probes the cause of disease and, if you pose as a physician for the disease of India, you will have to find out its true cause.
U||Reader: You are right. Now, I think you will not have to argue much with me to drive your conclusions home. I am impatient to know your[Pg 37] further views. We are now on a most interesting topic. I shall, therefore, endeavour to follow your thought, and stop you when I am in doubt.
U||Editor: I am afraid that, in spite of your enthusiasm, as we proceed further we shall have differences of opinion. Nevertheless, I shall argue only when you will stop me. We have already seen that the English merchants were able to get a footing in India because we encouraged them. When our princes fought among themselves, they sought the assistance of Company Bahadur. That corporation was versed alike in commerce and war. It was unhampered by questions of morality. Its object was to increase its commerce, and to make money. It accepted our assistance, and increased the number of its warehouses. To protect the latter it employed an army which was utilised by us also. Is it not then useless to blame the English for what we did at that time? The Hindus and the Mahomedans were at daggers drawn. This, too, gave the Company its opportunity; and thus we created the circumstances that gave the Company its control over India. Hence it is truer to say that we gave India to the English than that India was lost.
U||Reader: Will you now tell me how they are able to retain India?
U||Editor: The causes that gave them India enable them to retain it. Some Englishmen state that they took, and they hold, India by the sword.[Pg 38] Both these statements are wrong. The sword is entirely useless for holding India. We alone keep them. Napoleon is said to have described the English as a nation of shop-keepers. It is a fitting description. They hold whatever dominions they have for the sake of their commerce. Their army and their navy are intended to protect it. When the Transvaal offered no such attractions, the late Mr. Gladstone discovered that it was not right for the English to hold it. When it became a paying proposition, resistance led to war. Mr. Chamberlain soon discovered that England enjoyed a suzerainty over the Transvaal. It is related that some one asked the late President Kruger whether there was gold in the moon. He replied that it was highly unlikely, because, if there were, the English would have annexed it. Many problems can be solved by remembering that money is their God. Then
U|| it follows that we keep the English in India for our base self-interest. We like their commerce, they please us by their subtle methods, and get what they want from us. To blame them for this is to perpetuate their power. We further strengthen their hold by quarrelling amongst ourselves. If you accept the above statements, it is proved that the English entered India for the purposes of trade. They remain in it for the same purpose, and we help them to do so. Their arms and ammunition are perfectly useless. In[Pg 39] this connection, I remind you that it is the British flag which is waving in Japan, and not the Japanese. The English have a treaty with Japan for the sake of their commerce, and you will see that, if they can manage it, their commerce will greatly expand in that country. They wish to convert the whole world into a vast market for their goods. That they cannot do so is true, but the blame will not be theirs. They will leave no stone unturned to reach the goal.
U||CHAPTER VIII
U||The Condition of India
U||Reader: I now understand why the English hold India. I should like to know your views about the condition of our country.
U||Editor: It is a sad condition. In thinking of it, my eyes water and my throat get parched. I have grave doubts whether I shall be able sufficiently to explain what is in my heart. It is my deliberate opinion that India is being ground down not under the English heel but under that of modern civilization. It is groaning under the monster's terrible weight. There is yet time to escape it, but every day makes it more and more difficult. Religion is dear to me, and my first complaint is that India is becoming irreligious. Here I am not thinking of the Hindu and Mahomedan or the Zoroastrian religion,[Pg 40] but of the religion which underlies all religions. We are turning away from God.
U||Reader: How so?
U||Editor: There is a charge laid against us that we are a lazy people, and that the Europeans are industrious and enterprising. We have accepted the charge and we, therefore, wish to change our condition. Hinduism, Islamism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity and all other religions teach that we should remain passive about worldly pursuits and active about godly pursuits, that we should set a limit to our worldly ambition, and that our religious ambition should be illimitable. Our activity should be directed into the latter channel.
U||Reader: You seem to be encouraging religious charlatanism. Many a cheat has by talking in a similar strain led the people astray.
U||Editor: You are bringing an unlawful charge against religion. Humbug there undoubtedly is about all religions. Where there is light, there is also shadow. I am prepared to maintain that humbugs in worldly matters are far worse than the humbugs in religion. The humbug of civilization that I endeavour to show to you is not to be found in religion.
U||Reader: How can you say that? In the name of religion Hindus and Mahomedans fought against one another. For the same cause Christians fought Christians. Thousands of innocent men have been[Pg 41] murdered, thousands have been burned and tortured in its name. Surely, this is much worse than any civilization.
U||Editor: I certainly submit that the above hardships are far more bearable than those of civilization. Everybody understands that the cruelties you have named are not part of religion, although they have been practised in its name: therefore there is no aftermath to these cruelties. They will always happen so long as there are to be found ignorant and credulous people. But there is no end to the victims destroyed in the fire of civilization. Its deadly effect is that people came under its scorching flames believing it to be all good. They become utterly irreligious and, in reality, derive little advantage from the world. Civilization is like a mouse gnawing, while it is soothing us. When its full effect is realised, we will see that religious superstition is harmless compared to that of modern civilization. I am not pleading for a continuance of religious superstitions. We will certainly fight them tooth and nail, but we can never do so by disregarding religion. We can only do so by appreciating and conservin
U||g the latter.
U||Reader: Then you will contend that the Pax Britannica is a useless encumbrance?
U||Editor: You may see peace if you like; I see none.[Pg 42]
U||Reader: You make light of the terror that Thugs, the Pindaris, the Bhils were to the country.
U||Editor: If you will give the matter some thought, you will see that the terror was by no means such a mighty thing. If it had been a very substantial thing, the other people would have died away before the English advent. Moreover, the present peace is only nominal, for by it we have become emasculated and cowardly. We are not to assume that the English have changed the nature of the Pindaris and the Bhils. It is, therefore, better to suffer the Pindari peril than that some one else should protect us from it, and thus render us effeminate. I should prefer to be killed by the arrow of a Bhil than to seek unmanly protection. India without such protection was an India full of valour. Macaulay betrayed gross ignorance when he libelled Indians as being practically cowards. They never merited the charge. Cowards living in a country inhabited by hardy mountaineers, infested by wolves and tigers must surely find an early grave. Have you ever visited our fields? I assure you that our agriculturists sleep fearlessly o
U||n their farms even to-day, and the English, you and I would hesitate to sleep where they sleep. Strength lies in absence of fear, not in the quantity of flesh and muscle we may have on our bodies. Moreover, I must remind you who desire Home Rule that, after all, the Bhils, the Pindaris, the Assamese and[Pg 43] the Thugs are our own countrymen. To conquer them is your and my work. So long as we fear our own brethren, we are unfit to reach the goal.
U||CHAPTER IX
U||The Condition of India (Continued)
U||Railways
U||Reader: You have deprived me of the consolation I used to have regarding peace in India.
U||Editor: I have merely given you my opinion on the religious aspect, but when I give you my views as to the poverty of India you will perhaps begin to dislike me, because what you and I have hitherto considered beneficial for India no longer appears to me to be so.
U||Reader: What may that be?
U||Editor: Railways, lawyers and doctors have impoverished the country, so much so that, if we do not wake up in time, we shall be ruined.
U||Reader: I do now indeed fear that we are not likely to agree at all. You are attacking the very institutions which we have hitherto considered to be good.
U||Editor: It is necessary to exercise patience. The true inwardness of the evils of civilization you will understand with difficulty. Doctors assure us that a consumptive clings to life even when he is about to die. Consumption does not produce ap[Pg 44]parent hurt—it even produces a seductive colour about a patient's face, so as to induce the belief that all is well. Civilization is such a disease, and we have to be very wary.
U||Reader: Very well, then, I shall hear you on the railways.
U||Editor: It must be manifest to you that, but for the railways, the English could not have such a hold on India as they have. The railways, too, have spread the bubonic plague. Without them, masses could not move from place to place. They are the carriers of plague germs. Formerly we had natural segregation. Railways have also increased the frequency of famines, because, owing to facility of means of locomotion, people sell out their grain, and it is sent to the dearest markets. People become careless, and so the pressure of famine increases. They accentuate the evil nature of man. Bad men fulfil their evil designs with greater rapidity. The holy places of India have become unholy. Formerly people went to these places with very great difficulty. Generally, therefore, only the real devotees visited such places. Now-a-days, rogues visit them in order to practise their roguery.
U||Reader: You have given an one-sided account. Good men can visit these places as well as bad men. Why do they not take the fullest advantage of the railways?[Pg 45]
U||Editor: Good travels at a snail's pace—it can, therefore, have little to do with the railways. Those who want to do good are not selfish, they are not in a hurry, they know that to impregnate people with good requires a long time. But evil has wings. To build a house takes time. Its destruction takes none. So the railways can become a distributing agency for the evil one only. It may be a debatable matter whether railways spread famines, but it is beyond dispute that they propagate evil.
U||Reader: Be that as it may, all the disadvantages of railways are more than counter-balanced by the fact that it is due to them that we see in India the new spirit of nationalism.
U||Editor: I hold this to be a mistake. The English have taught us that we were not one nation before, and that it will require centuries before we become one nation. This is without foundation. We were one nation before they came to India. One thought inspired us. Our mode of life was the same. It was because we were one nation that they were able to establish one kingdom. Subsequently they divided us.
U||Reader: This requires an explanation.
U||Editor: I do not wish to suggest that because we were one nation we had no differences, but it is submitted that our leading men travelled throughout India either on foot or in bullock-carts. They[Pg 46] learned one another's languages, and there was no aloofness between them. What do you think could have been the intention of those far-seeing ancestors of ours who established Shethubindu-Rameshwar in the South, Juggernaut in the South-East and Hardwar in the North as places of pilgrimage? You will admit they were no fools. They knew that worship of God could have been performed just as well at home. They taught us that those whose hearts were aglow with righteousness had the Ganges in their own homes. But they saw that India was one undivided land so made by nature. They, therefore, argued that it must be one nation. Arguing thus, they established holy places in various parts of India, and fired the people with an idea of nationality in a manner unknown in other parts of the world. Any two Indians are one a
U||s no two Englishmen are. Only you and I and others who consider ourselves civilised and superior persons imagine that we are many nations. It was after the advent of railways that we began to believe in distinctions, and you are at liberty now to say that it is through the railways that we are beginning to abolish those distinctions. An opium-eater may argue the advantage of opium-eating from the fact that he began to understand the evil of the opium habit after having eaten it. I would ask you to consider well what I have said on the railways.[Pg 47]
U||Reader: I will gladly do so, but one question occurs to me even now. You have described to me the India of the pre-Mahomedan period, but now we have Mahomedans, Parsees and Christians. How can they be one nation? Hindus and Mahomedans are old enemies. Our very proverbs prove it. Mahomedans turn to the West for worship whilst Hindus turn to the East. The former look down on the Hindus as idolators. The Hindus worship the cow, the Mahomedans kill her. The Hindus believe in the doctrine of non-killing, the Mahomedans do not. We thus meet with differences at every step. How can India be one nation?
U||CHAPTER X
U||The Condition of India (Continued)
U||The Hindus and the Mahomedans
U||Editor: Your last question is a serious one; and yet, on careful consideration, it will be found to be easy of solution. The question arises because of the presence of the railways, of the lawyers and of the doctors. We shall presently examine the last two. We have already considered the railways. I should, however, like to add that man is so made by nature as to require him to restrict his movements as far as his hands and feet will take him. If we did not rush about from place to place by means of railways and such other maddening conveniences, much of the confusion that arises would be obviated.[Pg 48] Our difficulties are of our own creation. God set a limit to a man's locomotive ambition in the construction of his body. Man immediately proceeded to discover means of overriding the limit. God gifted man with intellect that he might know his Maker. Man abused it, so that he might forget his Maker. I am so constructed that I can only serve my immediate neighbours, but in my conceit, I pretend to have disco
U||vered that I must with my body serve every individual in the Universe. In thus attempting the impossible, man comes in contact with different natures, different religions and is utterly confounded. According to this reasoning, it must be apparent to you that railways are a most dangerous institution. Man has there through gone further away from his Maker.
U||Reader: But I am impatient to hear your answer to my question. Has the introduction of Mahomedanism not unmade the nation?
U||Editor: India cannot cease to be one nation because people belonging to different religions live in it. The introduction of foreigners does not necessarily destroy the nation, they merge in it. A country is one nation only when such a condition obtains in it. That country must have a faculty for assimilation. India has ever been such a country. In reality, there are as many religions as there are individuals, but those who are conscious of the[Pg 49] spirit of nationality do not interfere with one another's religion. If they do, they are not fit to be considered a nation. If the Hindus believe that India should be peopled only by Hindus, they are living in dreamland. The Hindus, the Mahomedans, the Parsees and the Christians who have made India their country are fellow-countrymen, and they will have to live in unity if only for their own interest. In no part of the world are one nationality and one religion synonymous terms; nor has it ever been so in India.
U||Reader: But what about the inborn enmity between Hindus and Mahomedans?
U||Editor: That phrase has been invented by our mutual enemy. When the Hindus and Mahomedans fought against one another, they certainly spoke in that strain. They have long since ceased to fight. How, then, can there be any inborn enmity? Pray remember this too, that we did not cease to fight only after British occupation. The Hindus flourished under Moslem sovereigns and Moslems under the Hindu. Each party recognised that mutual fighting was suicidal, and that neither party would abandon its religion by force of arms. Both parties, therefore, decided to live in peace. With the English advent the quarrels re-commenced.
U||The proverbs you have quoted were coined when both were fighting; to quote them now is obviously harmful. Should we not remember that[Pg 50] many Hindus and Mahomedans own the same ancestors, and the same blood runs through their veins? Do people become enemies because they change their religion? Is the God of the Mahomedan different from the God of the Hindu? Religions are different roads converging to the same point. What does it matter that we take different roads, so long as we reach the same goal? Wherein is the cause for quarrelling?
U||Moreover, there are deadly proverbs as between the followers of Shiva and those of Vishnu, yet nobody suggests that these two do not belong to the same nation. It is said that the Vedic religion is different from Jainism, but the followers of the respective faiths are not different nations. The fact is that we have become enslaved, and, therefore, quarrel and like to have our quarrels decided by a third party. There are Hindu iconoclasts as there are Mahomedan. The more we advance in true knowledge, the better we shall understand that we need not be at war with those whose religion we may not follow.
U||Reader: Now I would like to know your views about cow protection.
U||Editor: I myself respect the cow, that is I look upon her with affectionate reverence. The cow is the protector of India, because, it being an agricultural country, is dependant on the cow's[Pg 51] progeny. She is a most useful animal in hundreds of ways. Our Mahomedan brethren will admit this.
U||But, just as I respect the cow so do I respect my fellow-men. A man is just as useful as a cow, no matter whether he be a Mahomedan or a Hindu. Am I, then, to fight with or kill a Mahomedan in order to save a cow? In doing so, I would become an enemy as well of the cow as of the Mahomedan. Therefore, the only method I know of protecting the cow is that I should approach my Mahomedan brother and urge him for the sake of the country to join me in protecting her. If he would not listen to me, I should let the cow go for the simple reason that the matter is beyond my ability. If I were over full of pity for the cow, I should sacrifice my life to save her, but not take my brother's. This, I hold, is the law of our religion.
U||When men become obstinate, it is a difficult thing. If I pull one way, my Moslem brother will pull another. If I put on a superior air, he will return the compliment. If I bow to him gently, he will do it much more so, and if he does not, I shall not be considered to have done wrong in having bowed. When the Hindus became insistent, the killing of cows increased. In my opinion, cow protection societies may be considered cow-killing societies. It is a disgrace to us that we should need such societies. When we forgot how to protect cows, I suppose we needed such societies.[Pg 52]
U||What am I to do when a blood-brother is on the point of killing a cow? Am I to kill him, or to fall down at his feet and implore him? If you admit that I should adopt the latter course, I must do the same to my Moslem brother.
U||Who protects the cow from destruction by Hindus when they cruelly ill-treat her? Whoever reasons with the Hindus when they mercilessly belabour the progeny of the cow with their sticks? But this has not prevented us from remaining one nation.
U||Lastly, if it be true that the Hindus believe in the doctrine of non-killing and the Mahomedans do not, what, I pray, is the duty of the former? It is not written that a follower of the religion of Ahimsa (non-killing) may kill a fellow-man. For him the way is straight. In order to save one being, he may not kill another. He can only plead—therein lies his sole duty.
U||But does every Hindu believe in Ahimsa? Going to the root of the matter, not one man really practises such a religion, because we do destroy life. We are said to follow that religion because we want to obtain freedom from liability to kill any kind of life. Generally speaking, we may observe that many Hindus partake of meat and are not, therefore, followers of Ahimsa. It is, therefore, preposterous to suggest that the two cannot live[Pg 53] together amicably because the Hindus believe in Ahimsa and the Mahomedans do not.
U||These thoughts are put into our minds by selfish and false religious teachers. The English put the finishing touch. They have a habit of writing history; they pretend to study the manners and customs of all peoples. God has given us a limited mental capacity, but they usurp the function of the God-head and indulge in novel experiments. They write about their own researches in most laudatory terms and hypnotise us into believing them. We, in our ignorance, then fall at their feet.
U||Those who do not wish to misunderstand things may read up the Koran, and will find therein hundreds of passages acceptable to the Hindus; and the Bhagavad-Gita contains passages to which not a Mahomedan can take exception. Am I to dislike a Mahomedan because there are passages in the Koran I do not understand or like? It takes two to make a quarrel. If I do not want to quarrel with a Mahomedan, the latter will be powerless to foist a quarrel on me, and, similarly, I should be powerless if a Mahomedan refuses his assistance to quarrel with me. An arm striking the air will become disjointed. If every one will try to understand the core of his own religion and adhere to it, and will not allow false teachers to dictate to him, there will be no room left for quarrelling.[Pg 54]
U||Reader: But will the English ever allow the two bodies to join hands?
U||Editor: This question arises out of your timidity. It betrays our shallowness. If two brothers want to live in peace is it possible for a third party to separate them? If they were to listen to evil counsels, we would consider them to be foolish. Similarly, we Hindus and Mahomedans would have to blame our folly rather than the English, if we allowed them to put us asunder. A claypot would break through impact; if not with one stone, then with another. The way to save the pot is not to keep it away from the danger point, but to bake it so that no stone would break it. We have then to make our hearts of perfectly baked clay. Then we shall be steeled against all danger. This can be easily done by the Hindus. They are superior in numbers, they pretend that they are more educated, they are, therefore, better able to shield themselves from attack on their amicable relations with the Mahomedans.
U||There is mutual distrust between the two communities. The Mahomedans, therefore, ask for certain concessions from Lord Morley. Why should the Hindus oppose this? If the Hindus desisted, the English would notice it, the Mahomedans would gradually begin to trust the Hindus, and brotherliness would be the outcome.[Pg 55] We should be ashamed to take our quarrels to the English. Everyone can find out for himself that the Hindus can lose nothing by desisting. That man who has inspired confidence in another has never lost anything in this world.
U||I do not suggest that the Hindus and the Mahomedans will never fight. Two brothers living together often do so. We shall sometimes have our heads broken. Such a thing ought not to be necessary, but all men are not equiminded. When people are in a rage, they do many foolish things. These we have to put up with. But, when we do quarrel, we certainly do not want to engage counsel and to resort to English or any law-courts. Two men fight; both have their heads broken, or one only. How shall a third party distribute justice amongst them? Those who fight may expect to be injured.
U||CHAPTER XI
U||The Condition of India (Continued)
U||Lawyers
U||Reader: You tell me that, when two men quarrel, they should not go to a law-court. This is astonishing.
U||Editor: Whether you call it astonishing or not, it is the truth. And your question introduces us to the lawyers and the doctors. My firm opinion is that the lawyers have enslaved India and they[Pg 56] have accentuated the Hindu-Mahomedan dissensions, and have confirmed English authority.
U||Reader: It is easy enough to bring these charges, but it will be difficult for you to prove them. But for the lawyers, who would have shown us the road to independence? Who would have protected the poor? Who would have secured justice? For instance, the late Mr. Manomohan Ghose defended many a poor man free of charge. The Congress, which you have praised so much, is dependent for its existence and activity upon the work of the lawyers. To denounce such an estimable class of men is to spell justice injustice, and you are abusing the liberty of the press by decrying lawyers.
U||Editor: At one time I used to think exactly like you. I have no desire to convince you that they have never done a single good thing. I honour Mr. Ghose's memory. It is quite true that he helped the poor. That the Congress owes the lawyers something is believable. Lawyers are also men, and there is something good in every man. Whenever instances of lawyers having done good can be brought forward, it will be found that the good is due to them as men rather than as lawyers. All I am concerned with is to show you that the profession teaches immorality; it is exposed to temptations from which few are saved.
U||The Hindus and the Mahomedans have quarrelled. An ordinary man will ask them to forget[Pg 57] all about it, he will tell them that both must be more or less at fault, and will advise them no longer to quarrel. They go to lawyers. The latter's duty is to side with their clients, and to find out ways and arguments in favour of the clients to which they (the clients) are often strangers. If they do not do so, they will be considered to have degraded their profession. The lawyers, therefore, will, as a rule advance quarrels, instead of repressing them. Moreover, men take up that profession, not in order to help others out of their miseries, but to enrich themselves. It is one of the avenues of becoming wealthy and their interest exists in multiplying disputes. It is within my knowledge that they are glad when men have disputes. Petty pleaders actually manufacture them. Their touts, like so many leeches, suck the blood of the poor people. Lawyers are men who have little to do. Lazy people, in order to indulge in 
U||luxuries, take up such professions. This is a true statement. Any other argument is a mere pretension. It is the lawyers who have discovered that theirs is an honourable profession. They frame laws as they frame their own praises. They decide what fees they will charge, and they put on so much side that poor people almost consider them to be heaven-born. Why do they want more fees than common labourers? Why are their requirements greater? In what way are they more profitable to the country[Pg 58] than the labourers? Are those who do good entitled to greater payment? And, if they have done anything for the country for the sake of money, how shall it be counted as good?
U||Those who know anything of the Hindu-Mahomedan quarrels know that they have been often due to the intervention of lawyers. Some families have been ruined through them; they have made brothers enemies. Principalities, having come under lawyer's power, have become loaded with debt. Many have been robbed of their all. Such instances can be multiplied.
U||But the greatest injury they have done to the country is that they have tightened the English grip. Do you think that it would be possible for the English to carry on their government without law-courts? It is wrong to consider that courts are established for the benefit of the people. Those who want to perpetuate their power do so through the courts. If people were to settle their own quarrels, a third party would not be able to exercise any authority over them. Truly, men were less unmanly when they settled their disputes either by fighting or by asking their relatives to decide upon them. They became more unmanly and cowardly when they resorted to the courts of law. It was certainly a sign of savagery when they settled their disputes by fighting. Is it any the less so if I ask a third party to decide between[Pg 59] you and me? Surely, the decision of a third party is not always right. The parties alone know who is right. We, in our simplicity and ignorance, imagine that a stranger, by taking our money, gi
U||ves us justice.
U||The chief thing, however, to be remembered is that, without lawyers, courts could not have been established or conducted, and without the latter the English could not rule. Supposing that there were only English Judges, English Pleaders and English Police, they could only rule over the English. The English could not do without Indian Judges and Indian pleaders. How the pleaders were made in the first instance and how they were favoured you should understand well. Then you will have the same abhorrence for the profession that I have. If pleaders were to abandon their profession, and consider it just as degrading as prostitution, English rule would break up in a day. They have been instrumental in having the charge laid against us that we love quarrels and courts, as fish love water. What I have said with reference to the pleaders necessarily applies to the judges; they are first cousins, and the one gives strength to the other.[Pg 60]
U||CHAPTER XII
U||The Condition of India (Continued)
U||Doctors
U||Reader: I now understand the lawyers; the good they may have done is accidental. I feel that the profession is certainly hateful. You, however, drag in these doctors also, how is that?
U||Editor: The views I submit to you are those I have adopted. They are not original. Western writers have used stronger terms regarding both lawyers and doctors. One writer has likened the whole modern system to the Upas tree. Its branches are represented by parasitical professions, including those of law and medicine, and over the trunk has been raised the axe of true religion. Immorality is the root of the tree. So you will see that the views do not come right out of my mind, but they represent the combined experiences of many. I was at one time a great lover of the medical profession. It was my intention to become a doctor for the sake of the country. I no longer hold that opinion. I now understand why the medicine men (the vaids) among us have not occupied a very honourable status.
U||The English have certainly effectively used the medical profession for holding us. English physicians are known to have used the profession with several Asiatic potentates for political gain.[Pg 61]
U||Doctors have almost unhinged us. Sometimes I think that quacks are better than highly qualified doctors. Let us consider: the business of a doctor is to take care of the body, or, properly speaking, not even that. Their business is really to rid the body of diseases that may afflict it. How do these diseases arise? Surely by our negligence or indulgence. I overeat, I have indigestion, I go to a doctor, he gives me medicine. I am cured, I overeat again, and I take his pills again. Had I not taken the pills in the first instance, I would have suffered the punishment deserved by me, and I would not have overeaten again. The doctor intervened and helped me to indulge myself. My body thereby certainly felt more at ease, but my mind became weakened. A continuance of a course of a medicine must, therefore, result in loss of control over the mind.
U||I have indulged in vice, I contract a disease, a doctor cures me, the odds are that I shall repeat the vice. Had the doctor not intervened, nature would have done its work, and I would have acquired mastery over myself, would have been freed from vice, and would have become happy.
U||Hospitals are institutions for propagating sin. Men take less care of their bodies, and immorality increases. European doctors are the worst of all. For the sake of a mistaken care of the human body, they kill annually thousands of animals. They[Pg 62] practise vivisection. No religion sanctions this. All say that it is not necessary to take so many lives for the sake of our bodies.
U||These doctors violate our religious instinct. Most of their medical preparations contain either animal fat or spirituous liquors; both of these are tabooed by Hindus and Mahomedans. We may pretend to be civilised, call religious prohibitions a superstition and wantonly indulge in what we like. The fact remains that the doctors induce us to indulge, and the result is that we have become deprived of self-control and have become effeminate. In these circumstances, we are unfit to serve the country. To study European medicine is to deepen our slavery.
U||It is worth considering why we take up the profession of medicine. It is certainly not taken up for the purpose of serving humanity. We become doctors so that we may obtain honours and riches. I have endeavoured to show that there is no real service of humanity in the profession, and that it is injurious to mankind. Doctors make a show of their knowledge, and charge exorbitant fees. Their preparations, which are intrinsically worth a few pennies, cost shillings. The populace in its credulity and in the hope of ridding itself of some disease, allows itself to be cheated. Are not quacks then, whom we know, better than the doctors who put on an air of humaneness?[Pg 63]
U||CHAPTER XIII
U||What is True Civilization?
U||Reader: You have denounced railways, lawyers and doctors. I can see that you will discard all machinery. What, then, is civilization?
U||Editor: The answer to that question is not difficult. I believe that the civilization India has evolved is not to be beaten in the world. Nothing can equal the seeds sown by our ancestors. Rome went, Greece shared the same fate, the might of the Pharaohs was broken, Japan has become westernised, of China nothing can be said, but India is still, somehow or other, sound at the foundation. The people of Europe learn their lessons from the writings of the men of Greece or Rome, which exist no longer in their former glory. In trying to learn from them, the Europeans imagine that they will avoid the mistakes of Greece and Rome. Such is their pitiable condition. In the midst of all this, India remains immovable, and that is her glory. It is a charge against India that her people are so uncivilised, ignorant and stolid, that it is not possible to induce them to adopt any changes. It is a charge really against our merit. What we have tested and found true on the anvil of experience, we dare not change. Many thrust th
U||eir advice upon India, and she remains steady. This is her beauty; it is the sheet-anchor of our hope.[Pg 64]
U||Civilization is that mode of conduct which points out to man the path of duty. Performance of duty and observance of morality are convertible terms. To observe morality is to attain mastery over our mind and our passions. So doing, we know ourselves. The Gujarati equivalent for civilization means "good conduct."
U||If this definition be correct, then India, as so many writers have shown, has nothing to learn from anybody else, and this is as it should be. We notice that mind is a restless bird; the more it gets the more it wants, and still remains unsatisfied. The more we indulge our passions, the more unbridled they become. Our ancestors, therefore, set a limit to our indulgences. They saw that happiness was largely a mental condition. A man is not necessarily happy because he is rich, or unhappy because he is poor. The rich are often seem to be unhappy, the poor to be happy. Millions will always remain poor. Observing all this, our ancestors dissuaded us from luxuries and pleasures. We have managed with the same kind of plough as it existed thousands of years ago. We have retained the same kind of cottages that we had in former times, and our indigenous education remains the same as before. We have had no system of life-corroding competition. Each followed his own occupation or trade, and charged a regulation wage.[P
U||g 65] It was not that we did not know how to invent machinery, but our forefathers knew that, if we set our hearts after such things, we would become slaves and lose our moral fibre. They, therefore, after due deliberation, decided that we should only do what we could with our hands and feet. They saw that our real happiness and health consisted in a proper use of our hands and feet. They further reasoned that large cities were a snare and a useless encumbrance, and that people would not be happy in them, that there would be gangs of thieves and robbers, prostitution and vice flourishing in them, and that poor men would be robbed by rich men. They were, therefore, satisfied with small villages. They saw that kings and their swords were inferior to the sword of ethics, and they, therefore, held the sovereigns of the earth to be inferior to the Rishis and the Fakirs. A nation with a constitution like this is fitter to teach others than to learn from others. This nation had courts, lawyers and doctors, but they
U|| were all within bounds. Everybody knew that these professions were not particularly superior; moreover, these vakils and vaids did not rob people; they were considered people's dependents, not their masters. Justice was tolerably fair. The ordinary rule was to avoid courts. There were no touts to lure people into them. This evil, too, was noticeable only in and around capitals. The common people lived independ[Pg 66]ently, and followed their agricultural occupation. They enjoyed true Home Rule.
U||And where this cursed modern civilization has not reached, India remains as it was before. The inhabitants of that part of India will very properly laugh at your new-fangled notions. The English do not rule over them nor will you ever rule over them. Those whose name we speak we do not know, nor do they know us. I would certainly advise you and those like you who love the motherland to go into the interior that has yet not been polluted by the railways, and to live there for six months; you might then be patriotic and speak of Home Rule.
U||Now you see what I consider to be real civilization. Those who want to change conditions such as I have described are enemies of the country and are sinners.
U||Reader: It would be all right if India were exactly as you have described it; but it is also India where there are hundreds of child-widows, where two-year-old babies are married, where twelve-year-old girls are mothers and housewives, where women practise polyandry, where the practice of Niyog obtains, where, in the name of religion, girls dedicate themselves to prostitution, and where, in the name of religion, sheep and goats are killed. Do you consider these also symbols of the civilization that you have described?[Pg 67]
U||Editor: You make a mistake. The defects that you have shown are defects. Nobody mistakes them for ancient civilization. They remain in spite of it. Attempts have always been made, and will be made, to remove them. We may utilise the new spirit that is born in us for purging ourselves of these evils. But what I have described to you as emblems of modern civilization are accepted as such by its votaries. The Indian civilization, as described by me, has been so described by its votaries. In no part of the world, and under no civilization, have all men attained perfection. The tendency of Indian civilization is to elevate the moral being, that of the western civilization is to propagate immorality. The latter is godless, the former is based on a belief in God. So understanding and so believing, it behoves every lover of India to cling to the old Indian civilization even as a child clings to its mother's breast.
U||CHAPTER XIV
U||How Can India Become Free?
U||Reader: I appreciate your views about civilization. I will have to think over them. I cannot take in all at once. What, then, holding the views you do, would you suggest for freeing India?
U||Editor: I do not expect my views to be accepted all of a sudden. My duty is to place them[Pg 68] before readers like yourself. Time can be trusted to do the rest. We have already examined the conditions for freeing India, but we have done so indirectly; we will now do so directly. It is a world-known maxim that the removal of the cause of a disease results in the removal of the disease itself. Similarly, if the cause of India's slavery be removed, India can become free.
U||Reader: If Indian civilization is, as you say, the best of all, how do you account for India's slavery?
U||Editor: This civilization is unquestionably the best; but it is to be observed that all civilizations have been on their trial. That civilization which is permanent outlives it. Because the sons of India were found wanting, its civilization has been placed in jeopardy. But its strength is to be seen in its ability to survive the shock. Moreover, the whole of India is not touched. Those alone who have been affected by western civilization have become enslaved. We measure the universe by our own miserable foot-rule. When we are slaves, we think that the whole universe is enslaved. Because we are in an abject condition, we think that the whole of India is in that condition. As a matter of fact, it is not so, but it is as well to impute our slavery to the whole of India. But if we bear in mind the above fact we can see that, if we become free, India is free. And in this[Pg 69] thought you have a definition of Swaraj. It is Swaraj when we learn to rule ourselves. It is therefore in the palm of our hands. Do not c
U||onsider this Swaraj to be like a dream. Hence there is no idea of sitting still. The Swaraj that I wish to picture before you and me is such that, after we have once realised it, we will endeavour to the end of our lifetime to persuade others to do likewise. But such Swaraj has to be experienced by each one for himself. One drowning man will never save another. Slaves ourselves, it would be a mere pretension to think of freeing others. Now you will have seen that it is not necessary for us to have as our goal the expulsion of the English. If the English become Indianised, we can accommodate them. If they wish to remain in India along with their civilization, there is no room for them. It lies with us to bring about such a state of things.
U||Reader: It is impossible that Englishmen should ever become Indianised.
U||Editor: To say that is equivalent to saying that the English have no humanity in them. And it is really beside the point whether they become so or not. If we keep our own house in order, only those who are fit to live in it will remain. Others will leave of their own accord. Such things occur within the experience of all of us.
U||Reader: But it has not occurred in history![Pg 70]
U||Editor: To believe that, what has not occurred in history will not occur at all, is to argue disbelief in the dignity of man. At any rate, it behoves us to try what appeals to our reason. All countries are not similarly conditioned. The condition of India is unique. Its strength is immeasurable. We need not, therefore, refer to the history of other countries. I have drawn attention to the fact that, when other civilizations have succumbed, the Indians has survived many a shock.
U||Reader: I cannot follow this. There seems little doubt that we shall have to expel the English by force of arms. So long as they are in the country, we cannot rest. One of our poets says that slaves cannot even dream of happiness. We are, day by day, becoming weakened owing to the presence of the English. Our greatness is gone; our people look like terrified men. The English are in the country like a blight which we must remove by every means.
U||Editor: In your excitement, you have forgotten all we have been considering. We brought the English, and we keep them. Why do you forget that our adoption of their civilization makes their presence in India at all possible? Your hatred against them ought to be transferred to their civilization. But let us assume that we have to drive away the English by fighting; how is that to be done?[Pg 71]
U||Reader: In the same way as Italy did it. What it was possible for Mazzini and Garibaldi to do, is possible for us. You cannot deny that they were very great men.
U||CHAPTER XV
U||Italy and India
U||Editor: It is well that you have instanced Italy. Mazzini was a great and good man; Garibaldi was a great warrior. Both are adorable; from their lives we can learn much. But the condition of Italy was different from that of India. In the first instance the difference between Mazzini and Garibaldi is worth noting. Mazzini's ambition was not, and has not yet been realised, regarding Italy. Mazzini has shown in his writings on the duty of man that every man must learn how to rule himself. This has not happened in Italy. Garibaldi did not hold this view of Mazzini's. Garibaldi gave, and every Italian took arms. Italy and Austria had the same civilization; they were cousins in this respect. It was a matter of tit for tat. Garibaldi simply wanted Italy to be free from the Austrian yoke. The machinations of Minister Cavour disgrace that portion of the history of Italy. And what has been the result? If you believe that, because Italians rule Italy, the Italian nation is happy, you are groping in darkness.[Pg 72] Maz
U||zini has shown conclusively that Italy did not become free. Victor Emanuel gave one meaning to the expression; Mazzini gave another. According to Emanuel, Cavour, and even Garibaldi, Italy meant the King of Italy and his henchmen. According to Mazzini, it meant the whole of the Italian people, that is, its agriculturists. Emanuel was only its servant. The Italy of Mazzini still remains in a state of slavery. At the time of the so-called national war, it was a game of chess between two rival kings, with the people of Italy as pawns. The working classes in that land are still unhappy. They therefore indulge in assassination, rise in revolt, and rebellion on their part is always expected. What substantial gain did Italy obtain after the withdrawal of the Austrian troops? The gain was only nominal. The reforms, for the sake of which the war was supposed to have been undertaken, have not yet been granted. The condition of the people, in general, still remains the same. I am sure you do not wish to reproduce such 
U||a condition in India. I believe that you want the millions of India to be happy, not that you want the reins of Government in your hands. If that be so, we have to consider only one thing: how can the millions obtain self-rule? You will admit that people under several Indian princes are being ground down. The latter mercilessly crush them. Their tyranny is greater than that of the English,[Pg 73] and, if you want such tyranny in India, that we shall never agree. My patriotism does not teach me that I am to allow people to be crushed under the heel of Indian princes, if only the English retire. If I have the power, I should resist the tyranny of Indian princes just as much as that of the English. By patriotism I mean the welfare of the whole people, and, if I could secure it at the hands of the English, I should bow down my head to them. If any Englishman dedicated his life to securing the freedom of India, resisting tyranny and serving the land, I should welcome that Englishman as an Indian.
U||Again, India can fight like Italy only when she has arms. You have not considered this problem at all. The English are splendidly armed; that does not frighten me, but it is clear that, to fit ourselves against them in arms, thousands of Indians must be armed. If such a thing be possible, how many years will it take. Moreover, to arm India on a large scale is to Europeanise it. Then her condition will be just as pitiable as that of Europe. This means, in short, that India must accept European civilization, and if that is what we want, the best thing is that we have among us those who are so well trained in that civilization. We will then fight for a few rights, will get what we can and so pass our days. But the fact is that the Indian nation will not adopt arms, and it is well that it does not.[Pg 74]
U||Reader: You are overassuming facts. All need not be armed. At first, we will assassinate a few Englishmen and strike terror; then a few men who will have been armed will fight openly. We may have to lose a quarter of a million men, more or less, but we will regain our land. We will undertake guerilla warfare, and defeat the English.
U||Editor: That is to say, you want to make the holy land of India unholy. Do you not tremble to think of freeing India by assassination? What we need to do is to kill ourselves. It is a cowardly thought, that of killing others. Whom do you suppose to free by assassination? The millions of India do not desire it. Those who are intoxicated by the wretched modern civilization think of these things. Those who will rise to power by murder will certainly not make the nation happy. Those who believe that India has gained by Dhingra's act and such other acts in India make a serious mistake. Dhingra was a patriot, but his love was blind. He gave his body in a wrong way; its ultimate result can only be mischievous.
U||Reader: But you will admit that the English have been frightened by these murders, and that Lord Morley's reforms are due to fear.
U||Editor: The English are both a timid and a brave nation. She is, I believe, easily influenced by the use of gunpowder. It is possible that Lord Morley has granted the reforms through fear, but[Pg 75] what is granted under fear can be retained only so long as the fear lasts.
U||CHAPTER XVI
U||Brute-Force
U||Reader: This is a new doctrine; that what is gained through fear is retained only while the fear lasts. Surely, what is given will not be withdrawn?
U||Editor: Not so. The Proclamation of 1857 was given at the end of a revolt, and for the purpose of preserving peace. When peace was secured and people became simple-minded, its full effect was toned down. If I ceased stealing for fear of punishment, I would re-commence the operation so soon as the fear is withdrawn from me. This is almost a universal experience. We have assumed that we can get men to do things by force and, therefore, we use force.
U||Reader: Will you not admit that you are arguing against yourself? You know that what the English obtained in their own country they have obtained by using brute-force. I know you have argued that what they have obtained is useless, but that does not affect my argument. They wanted useless things, and they got them. My point is that their desire was fulfilled. What does it matter what means they adopted? Why should we not obtain our goal which is good, by any means[Pg 76] whatsoever even by using violence? Shall I think of the means when I have to deal with a thief in the house? My duty is to drive him out anyhow. You seem to admit that we have received nothing, and that we shall receive nothing by petitioning. Why, then, may we not do so by using brute-force? And, to retain what we may receive, we shall keep up the fear by using the same force to the extent that it may be necessary. You will not find fault with a continuance of force to prevent a child from thrusting its foot into fire? Somehow or other, we 
U||have to gain our end.
U||Editor: Your reasoning is plausible. It has deluded many. I have used similar arguments before now. But I think I know better now, and I shall endeavour to undeceive you. Let us first take the argument that we are justified in gaining our end by using brute-force, because the English gained theirs by using similar means. It is perfectly true that they used brute-force, and that it is possible for us to do likewise: but by using similar means, we can get only the same thing that they got. You will admit that we do not want that. Your belief that there is no connection between the means and the end is a great mistake. Through that mistake even men who have been considered religious have committed grievous crimes. Your reasoning is the same as saying that we can get a rose through planting a noxious[Pg 77] weed. If I want to cross the ocean, I can do so only by means of a vessel; if I were to use a cart for that purpose, both the cart and I would soon find the bottom. "As is the God, so is the votary," is a max
U||im worth considering. Its meaning has been distorted, and men have gone astray. The means may be likened to a seed, the end to a tree; and there is just the same inviolable connection between the means and the end as there is between the seed and the tree. I am not likely to obtain the result flowing from the worship of God by laying myself prostrate before Satan. If, therefore, anyone were to say: "I want to worship God: it does not matter that I do so by means of Satan," it would be set down as ignorant folly. We reap exactly as we sow. The English in 1833 obtained greater voting power by violence. Did they, by using brute-force, better appreciate their duty? They wanted the right of voting, which they obtained by using physical-force. But real rights are a result of performance of duty; these rights they have not obtained. We, therefore, have before us in England the force of everybody wanting and insisting on his rights, nobody thinking of his duty. And, where everybody wants rights, who shall give them 
U||and to whom? I do not wish to imply that they never perform their duty, but I do wish to imply that they do not perform the duty to which those rights should correspond; and, as they do not perform[Pg 78] that particular duty, namely, acquire fitness, their rights have proved a burden to them. In other words, what they have obtained is an exact result of the means they adopted. They used the means corresponding to the end. If I want to deprive you of your watch, I shall certainly have to fight for it; if I want to buy your watch, I shall have to pay you for it; and, if I want a gift, I shall have to plead for it; and, according to the means I employ, the watch is stolen property, my own property, or a donation. Thus we see three different results from three different means. Will you still say that means do not matter?
U||Now we shall take the example given by you of the thief to be driven out. I do not agree with you that the thief may be driven out by any means. If it is my father who has come to steal I shall use one kind of means. If it is an acquaintance, I shall use another; and, in the case of a perfect stranger, I shall use a third. If it is a white man, you will perhaps say, you will use means different from those you will adopt with an Indian thief. If it is a weakling, the means will be different from those to be adopted for dealing with an equal in physical strength; and, if the thief is armed from tip to toe, I shall simply remain quiet. Thus we have a variety of means between the father and the armed man. Again, I fancy that I should pretend to be sleeping whether[Pg 79] the thief was my father or that strong-armed man. The reason for this is that my father would also be armed, and I should succumb to the strength possessed by either, and allow my things to be stolen. The strength of my father would make me weep
U|| with pity; the strength of the armed man would rouse in me anger, and we should become enemies. Such is the curious situation. From these examples, we may not be able to agree as to the means to be adopted in each case. I myself seem clearly to see what should be done in all these cases, but the remedy may frighten you. I, therefore, hesitate to place it before you. For the time being, I will leave you to guess it, and, if you cannot, it is clear that you will have to adopt different means in each case. You will also have seen that any means will not avail to drive away the thief. You will have to adopt means to fit each case. Hence it follows that your duty is not to drive away the thief by any means you like.
U||Let us proceed a little further. That a well-armed man has stolen your property, you have harboured the thought, you are filled with anger; you argue that you want to punish that rogue, not for your own sake, but for the good of your neighbours; you have collected a number of armed men, you want to take his house by assault, he is duly informed of it, he runs away; he[Pg 80] too, is incensed. He collects his brother-robbers, and sends you a defiant message that he will commit robbery in broad day-light. You are strong, you do not fear him, you are prepared to receive him. Meanwhile, the robber pesters your neighbours. They complain before you, you reply that you are doing all for their sake; you do not mind that your own goods have been stolen. Your neighbours reply that the robber never pestered them before, and that he commenced his depredations only after you declared hostilities against him. You are between Sylla and Charybdis. You are full of pity for the poor men. What they say is true. What are you to
U|| do? You will be disgraced if you now leave the robber alone. You, therefore, tell the poor men: "Never mind. Come, my wealth is yours, I will give you arms, I will teach you how to use them; you should belabour the rogue; don't you leave him alone." And so the battle grows; the robbers increase in number; your neighbours have deliberately put themselves to inconvenience. Thus the result of wanting to take revenge upon the robber is that you have disturbed your own peace; you are in perpetual fear of being robbed and assaulted; your courage has given place to cowardice. If you will patiently examine the argument, you will see that I have not overdrawn the picture. This is one of the means. Now let us examine the other. You set this armed robber down as an ignorant[Pg 81] brother; you intend to reason with him at a suitable opportunity; you argue that he is, after all, a fellow-man; you do not know what prompted him to steal. You, therefore, decide that, when you can, you will destroy the man's motive for ste
U||aling. Whilst you are thus reasoning with yourself, the man comes again to steal. Instead of being angry with him, you take pity on him. You think that this stealing habit must be a disease with him. Henceforth you, therefore, keep your doors and windows open; you change your sleeping-place, and you keep your things in a manner most accessible to him. The robber comes again, and is confused, as all this is new to him; nevertheless, he takes away your things. But his mind is agitated. He inquires about you in the village, he comes to learn about your broad and loving heart, he repents, he begs your pardon, returns you your things, and leaves off the stealing habit. He becomes your servant, and you find for him honourable employment. This is the second method. Thus, you see different means have brought about totally different results. I do not wish to deduce from this that robbers will act in the above manner or that all will have the same pity and love like you; but I wish only to show that only fair means ca
U||n produce fair results, and that, at least in the majority of cases, if not, indeed, in all, the force of love and pity is infinitely greater[Pg 82] than the force of arms. There is harm in the exercise of brute-force, never in that of pity.
U||Now we will take the question of petitioning. It is a fact beyond dispute that a petition, without the backing of force, is useless. However, the late Justice Ranade used to say that petitions served a useful purpose because they were a means of educating people. They give the latter an idea of their condition, and warn the rulers. From this point of view, they are not altogether useless. A petition of an equal is a sign of courtesy; a petition from a slave is a symbol of his slavery. A petition backed by force is a petition from an equal and, when he transmits his demand in the form of a petition, it testifies to his nobility. Two kinds of force can back petitions. "We will hurt you if you do not give this" is one kind of force; it is the force of arms, whose evil results we have already examined. The second kind of force can thus be stated: "If you do not concede our demand, we will be no longer your petitioners. You can govern us only so long as we remain the governed; we shall no longer have any dealings
U|| with you." The force implied in this may be described as love-force, soul-force, or, more popularly but less accurately, passive resistance. This force is indestructible. He who uses it perfectly understands his position. We have an ancient proverb which literally means "One negative cures[Pg 83] thirty-six diseases." The force of arms is powerless when matched against the force of love or the soul.
U||Now we shall take your last illustration, that of the child thrusting its foot into fire. It will not avail you. What do you really do to the child? Supposing that it can exert so much physical force that it renders you powerless and rushes into fire, then you cannot prevent it. There are only two remedies open to you—either you must kill it in order to prevent it from perishing in the flames, or you must give your own life, because you do not wish to see it perish before your very eyes. You will not kill it. If your heart is not quite full of pity, it is possible that you will not surrender yourself by preceding the child and going into the fire yourself. You, therefore, helplessly allow it to go into the flames. Thus, at any rate, you are not using physical force. I hope you will not consider that it is still physical-force, though of a low order, when you would forcibly prevent the child from rushing towards the fire if you could. That force is of a different order, and we have to understand what it is.
U||Remember that, in thus preventing the child, you are minding entirely its own interest, you are exercising authority for its sole benefit. Your example does not apply to the English. In using brute-force against the English, you consult entirely your own, that is the national interest. There is no[Pg 84] question here either of pity or of love. If you say that the actions of the English, being evil, represent fire, and that they proceed to their actions through ignorance, and that, therefore, they occupy the position of a child, and that you want to protect such a child, then you will have to overtake every such evil action by whomsoever committed, and, as in the case of the child, you will have to sacrifice yourself. If you are capable of such immeasurable pity, I wish you well in its exercise.
U||CHAPTER XVII
U||Passive Resistance
U||Reader: Is there any historical evidence as to the success of what you have called soul-force or truth-force? No instance seems to have happened of any nation having risen through soul-force. I still think that the evil-doers will not cease doing evil without physical punishment.
U||Editor: The poet Tulsidas has said: "Of religion, pity or love is the root, as egotism of the body. Therefore, we should not abandon pity so long as we are alive." This appears to me to be a scientific truth. I believe in it as much as I believe in two and two being four. The force of love is the same as the force of the soul or truth. We have evidence of its working at every step. The universe[Pg 85] would disappear without the existence of that force. But you ask for historical evidence. It is, therefore, necessary to know what history means. The Gujarati equivalent means: "It so happened." If that is the meaning of history, it is possible to give copious evidence. But if it means the doings of kings and emperors, there can be no evidence of soul-force or passive resistance in such history. You cannot expect silver-ore in a tin-mine. History, as we know it, is a record of the wars of the world, and so there is a proverb among Englishmen that a nation which has no history, that is, no wars, is a happy natio
U||n. How kings played how they become enemies of one another and how they murdered one another is found accurately recorded in history and, if this were all that had happened in the world, it would have been ended long ago. If the story of the universe had commenced with wars, not a man would have been found alive to-day. Those people who have been warred against have disappeared, as, for instance, the natives of Australia, of whom hardly a man was left alive by the intruders. Mark, please, that these natives did not use soul-force in self-defence, and it does not require much foresight to know that the Australians will share the same fate as their victims. "Those that wield the sword shall perish by the sword." With us, the proverb is that professional swimmers will find a watery grave.[Pg 86]
U||The fact that there are so many men still alive in the world shows that it is based not on the force of arms but on the force of truth or love. Therefore the greatest and most unimpeachable evidence of the success of this force is to be found in the fact that, in spite of the wars of the world, it still lives on.
U||Thousands, indeed, tens of thousands, depend for their existence on a very active working of this force. Little quarrels of millions of families in their daily lives disappear before the exercise of this force. Hundreds of nations live in peace. History does not and cannot take note of this fact. History is really a record of every interruption of the even working of the force of love or of the soul. Two brothers quarrel: one of them repents and re-awakens the love that was lying dormant in him; the two again begin to live in peace: nobody takes note of this. But if the two brothers, through the intervention of solicitors or some other reason, take up arms or go to law—which is another form of the exhibition of brute-force—their doings would be immediately noticed in the press, they would be the talk of their neighbours, and would probably go down to history. And what is true of families and communities is true of nations. There is no reason, to believe that there is one law for families, and another for
U|| nations. History, then, is a record of an[Pg 87] interruption of the course of nature. Soul-force, being natural, is not noted in history.
U||Reader: According to what you say, it is plain that instances of the kind of passive resistance are not to be found in history. It is necessary to understand this passive resistance more fully. It will be better, therefore, if you enlarge upon it.
U||Editor: Passive resistance is a method of securing rights by personal suffering; it is the reverse of resistance by arms. When I refuse to do a thing that is repugnant to my conscience, I use soul-force. For instance, the government of the day has passed a law which is applicable to me: I do not like it, if, by using violence, I force the government to repeal the law, I am employing what may be termed body-force. If I do not obey the law and accept the penalty for its breach, I use soul-force. It involves sacrifice of self.
U||Everybody admits that sacrifice of self is infinitely superior to sacrifice of others. Moreover, if this kind of force is used in a cause that is unjust only the person using it suffers. He does not make others suffer for his mistakes. Men have before now done many things which were subsequently found to have been wrong. No man can claim to be absolutely in the right, or that a particular thing is wrong, because he thinks so, but it is wrong for him so long as that is his deliberate judgment.[Pg 88] It is, therefore, meet that he should not do that which he knows to be wrong, and suffer the consequence whatever it may be. This is the key to the use of soul-force.
U||Reader: You would then disregard laws—this is rank disloyalty. We have always been considered a law-abiding nation. You seem to be going even beyond the extremists. They say that we must obey the laws that have been passed, but that, if the laws be bad, we must drive out the law-givers even by force.
U||Editor: Whether I go beyond them or whether I do not, is a matter of no consequence to either of us. We simply want to find out what is right, and to act accordingly. The real meaning of the statement that we are a law-abiding nation is that we are passive resisters. When we do not like certain laws, we do not break the heads of law-givers, but we suffer and do not submit to the laws. That we should obey laws whether good or bad is a new-fangled notion. There was no such thing in former days. The people disregarded those laws they did not like, and suffered the penalties for their breach. It is contrary to our manhood, if we obey laws repugnant to our conscience. Such teaching is opposed to religion and means slavery. If the government were to ask us to go about without any clothing, should we do so? If I were a passive resister, I would say to[Pg 89] them that I would have nothing to do with their law. But we have so forgotten ourselves and become so compliant, that we do not mind any degrading law.
U||A man who has realised his manhood, who fears only God, will fear no one else. Man-made laws are not necessarily binding on him. Even the government do not expect any such thing from us. They do not say: "You must do such and such a thing," but they say: "If you do not do it, we will punish you." We are sunk so low, that we fancy that it is our duty and our religion to do what the law lays down. If man will only realise that it is unmanly to obey laws that are unjust, no man's tyranny will enslave him. This is the key to self-rule or home-rule.
U||It is a superstition and an ungodly thing to believe that an act of a majority binds a minority. Many examples can be given in which acts of majorities will be found to have been wrong, and those of minorities to have been right. All reforms owe their origin to the initiation of minorities in opposition to majorities. If among a band of robbers, a knowledge of robbing is obligatory, is a pious man to accept the obligation? So long as the superstition that men should obey unjust laws exists, so long will their slavery exist. And a passive resister alone can remove such a superstition.[Pg 90]
U||To use brute-force, to use gun-powder is contrary to passive resistance; for it means that we want our opponent to do by force—that which we desire but he does not. And, if such a use of force is justifiable, surely he is entitled to do likewise by us. And so we should never come to an agreement. We may simply fancy, like the blind horse moving in a circle round a mill, that we are making progress. Those who believe that they are not bound to obey laws which are repugnant to their conscience have only the remedy of passive resistance open to them. Any other must lead to disaster.
U||Reader: From what you say, I deduce that passive resistance is a splendid weapon of the weak but that, when they are strong, they may take up arms.
U||Editor: This is gross ignorance. Passive resistance, that is, soul-force, is matchless. It is superior to the force of arms. How, then, can it be considered only a weapon of the weak? Physical force men are strangers to the courage that is requisite in a passive resister. Do you believe that a coward can ever disobey a law that he dislikes? Extremists are considered to be advocates of brute-force. Why do they, then, talk about obeying laws? I do not blame them. They can say nothing else. When they succeed in driving out the English, and they themselves become governors, they will want you and me to obey their laws. And that is a[Pg 91] fitting thing for their constitution. But a passive resister will say he will not obey a law that is against his conscience, even though he may be blown to pieces at the mouth of a cannon.
U||What do you think? Wherein is courage required—in blowing others to pieces from behind a cannon or with a smiling face to approach a cannon and to be blown to pieces? Who is the true warrior—he who keeps death always as a bosom-friend or he who controls the death of others? Believe me that a man devoid of courage and manhood can never be a passive resister.
U||This, however, I will admit: that even a man, weak in body, is capable of offering this resistance. One man can offer it just as well as millions. Both men and women can indulge in it. It does not require the training of an army; it needs no Jiu-jitsu. Control over the mind is alone necessary, and, when that is attained, man is free like the king of the forest, and his very glance withers the enemy.
U||Passive resistance is an all-sided sword; it can be used anyhow; it blesses him who uses it and him against whom it is used. Without drawing a drop of blood, it produces far-reaching results. It never rusts, and cannot be stolen. Competition between passive resisters does not exhaust. The sword of passive resistance does not require a scabbard. It is strange indeed that you should[Pg 92] consider such a weapon to be a weapon merely of the weak.
U||Reader: You have said that passive resistance is a speciality of India. Have cannons never been used in India?
U||Editor: Evidently, in your opinion, India means its few princes. To me, it means its teeming millions, on whom depends the existence of its princes and our own.
U||Kings will always use their kingly weapons. To use force is bred in them. They want to command, but those who have to obey commands, do not want guns; and these are in a majority throughout the world. They have to learn either body-force or soul-force. Where they learn the former, both the rulers and the ruled become like so many mad men, but, where they learn soul-force, the commands of the rulers do not go beyond the point of their swords, for true men disregard unjust commands. Peasants have never been subdued by the sword, and never will be. They do not know the use of the sword, and they are not frightened by the use of it by others. That nation is great which rests its head upon death as its pillow. Those who defy death are free from all fear. For those who are labouring under the delusive charms of brute-force, this picture is not overdrawn. The fact is that, in India, the nation at large has generally used passive resistance in all[Pg 93] departments of life. We cease to co-operate with our rulers wh
U||en they displease us. This is passive resistance.
U||I remember an instance when, in a small principality, the villagers were offended by some command issued by the prince. The former immediately began vacating the village. The prince became nervous, apologised to his subjects and withdrew his command. Many such instances can be found in India. Real home-rule is possible only where passive resistance is the guiding force of the people. Any other rule is foreign rule.
U||Reader: Then you will say that it is not at all necessary for us to train the body?
U||Editor: I will certainly not say any such thing. It is difficult to become a passive resister, unless the body is trained. As a rule, the mind, residing in a body that has become weakened by pampering, is also weak, and where there is no strength of mind, there can be no strength of soul. We will have to improve our physique by getting rid of infant marriages and luxurious living. If I were to ask a man having a shattered body to face a cannon's mouth I would make of myself a laughing-stock.
U||Reader: From what you say, then, it would appear that it is not a small thing to become a passive resister, and, if that is so, I would like you to explain how a man may become a passive resister.[Pg 94]
U||Editor: To become a passive resister is easy enough, but it is also equally difficult. I have known a lad of fourteen years become a passive resister; I have known also sick people doing likewise and I have also known physically strong and otherwise happy people being unable to take up passive resistance. After a great deal of experience, it seems to me that those who want to become passive resisters for the service of the country have to observe perfect chastity, adopt poverty, follow truth, and cultivate fearlessness.
U||Chastity is one of the greatest disciplines without which the mind cannot attain requisite firmness. A man who is unchaste loses stamina, becomes emasculated and cowardly. He whose mind is given over to animal passions is not capable of any great effort. This can be proved by innumerable instances. What, then, is a married person to do, is the question that arises naturally; and yet it need not. When a husband and wife gratify the passions, it is no less an animal indulgence on that account. Such an indulgence, except for perpetuating the race, is strictly prohibited. But a passive resister has to avoid even that very limited indulgence, because he can have no desire for progeny. A married man, therefore, can observe perfect chastity. This subject is not capable of being treated at greater length. Several questions arise: How is one to carry one's wife[Pg 95] with one? What are her rights, and such other questions? Yet those who wish to take part in a great work are bound to solve these puzzles.
U||Just as there is necessity for chastity, so is there for poverty. Pecuniary ambition and passive resistance cannot well go together. Those who have money are not expected to throw it away, but they are expected to be indifferent about it. They must be prepared to lose every penny rather than give up passive resistance.
U||Passive resistance has been described in the course of our discussion as truth-force. Truth, therefore, has necessarily to be followed, and that at any cost. In this connection, academic questions such as whether a man may not lie in order to save a life, etc. arise, but these questions occur only to those who wish to justify lying. Those who want to follow truth every time are not placed in such a quandary, and, if they are, they are still saved from a false position.
U||Passive resistance cannot proceed a step without fearlessness. Those alone can follow the path of passive resistance who are free from fear whether as to their possessions, false honour, their relatives, the government, bodily injuries, death.
U||These observances are not to be abandoned in the belief that they are difficult. Nature has implanted in the human breast ability to cope with any difficulty or suffering that may come to man[Pg 96] unprovoked. These qualities are worth having, even for those who do not wish to serve the country. Let there be no mistake as those who want to train themselves in the use of arms are also obliged to have these qualities more or less. Everybody does not become a warrior for the wish. A would-be warrior will have to observe chastity, and to be satisfied with poverty as his lot. A warrior without fearlessness cannot be conceived of. It may be thought that he would not need to be exactly truthful, but that quality follows real fearlessness. When a man abandons truth, he does so owing to fear in some shape or form. The above four attributes, then, need not frighten any one. It may be as well here to note that a physical-force man has to have many other useless qualities which a passive resister never needs. And you w
U||ill find that whatever extra effort a swordsman needs is due to lack of fearlessness. If he is an embodiment of the latter, the sword will drop from his hand that very moment. He does not need its support. One who is free from hatred requires no sword. A man with a stick suddenly came face to face with a lion, and instinctively raised his weapon in self-defence. The man saw that he had only prated about fearlessness when there was none in him. That moment he dropped the stick, and found himself free from all fear.[Pg 97]
U||CHAPTER XVIII
U||Education
U||Reader: In the whole of our discussion, you have not demonstrated the necessity for education; we always complain of its absence among us. We notice a movement for compulsory education in our country. The Maharaja of Gaekwar has introduced it in his territories. Every eye is directed towards them. We bless the Maharaja for it. Is all this effort then of no use?
U||Editor: If we consider our civilization to be the highest, I have regretfully to say that much of the effort you have described is of no use. The motive of the Maharaja and other great leaders who have been working in this direction is perfectly pure. They, therefore, undoubtedly deserve great praise. But we cannot conceal from ourselves the result that is likely to flow from their effort.
U||What is the meaning of education? If it simply means a knowledge of letters, it is merely an instrument, and an instrument may be well used or abused. The same instrument that may be used to cure a patient may be used to take his life, and so may a knowledge of letters. We daily observe that many men abuse it, and very few make good use of it, and if this is a correct statement, we have proved that more harm has been done by it than good.
U||The ordinary meaning of education is a knowledge of letters. To teach boys reading,[Pg 98] writing and arithmetic is called primary education. A peasant earns his bread honestly. He has ordinary knowledge of the world. He knows fairly well how he should behave towards his parents, his wife, his children and his fellow-villagers. He understands and observes the rules of morality. But he cannot write his own name. What do you propose to do by giving him a knowledge of letters? Will you add an inch to his happiness? Do you wish to make him discontented with his cottage or his lot? And even if you want to do that, he will not need such an education. Carried away by the flood of western thought, we came to the conclusion, without weighing pros and cons, that we should give this kind of education to the people.
U||Now let us take higher education. I have learned Geography, Astronomy, Algebra, Geometry, etc. What of that? In what way have I benefitted myself or those around me? Why have I learned these things? Professor Huxley has thus defined education:—"That man I think has had a liberal education who has been so trained in youth that his body is the ready servant of his will and does with ease and pleasure all the work that as a mechanism it is capable of, whose intellect is a clear, cold logic engine with all its parts of equal strength and in smooth working order ... whose mind is stored with a knowledge of the fundamental truths of nature ... whose passions are trained to come[Pg 99] to heel by a vigorous will, the servant of a tender conscience ... who has learnt to hate all vileness and to respect others as himself. Such an one and no other, I conceive, has had a liberal education, for he is in harmony with Nature. He will make the best of her and she of him."
U||If this be true education, I must emphatically say that the sciences I have enumerated above, I have never been able to use for controlling my senses. Therefore, whether you take elementary education or higher education, it is not required for the main thing. It does not make of us men. It does not enable us to do our duty.
U||Reader: If that is so, I shall have to ask you another question. What enables you to tell all these things to me? If you had not received higher education, how would you have been able to explain to me the things that you have?
U||Editor: You have spoken well. But my answer is simple: I do not for one moment believe that my life would have been wasted, had I not received higher or lower education. Nor do I consider that I necessarily serve because I speak. But I do desire to serve and, in endeavouring to fulfil that desire, I make use of the education I have received. And, if I am making good use of it, even then it is not for the millions, but I can use it only for such as you, and this supports my contention. Both you and I have come under the bane of what is mainly[Pg 100] false education. I claim to have become free from its ill-effects, and I am trying to give you the benefit of my experience, and, in doing so, I am demonstrating the rottenness of this education.
U||Moreover, I have not run down a knowledge of letters under all circumstances. All I have shown is that we must not make of it a fetish. It is not our Kamdhuk. In its place it can be of use, and it has its place when we have brought our senses under subjection, and put our ethics on a firm foundation. And then, if we feel inclined to receive that education, we may make good use of it. As an ornament it is likely to sit well on us. It now follows that it is not necessary to make this education compulsory. Our ancient school system is enough. Character-building has the first place in it, and that is primary education. A building erected on that foundation will last.
U||Reader: Do I then understand that you do not consider English education necessary for obtaining Home Rule?
U||Editor: My answer is yes and no. To give millions a knowledge of English is to enslave them. The foundation that Macaulay laid of education has enslaved us. I do not suggest that he had any such intention, but that has been the result. Is it not a sad commentary that we should have to speak of Home Rule in a foreign tongue?[Pg 101]
U||And it is worthy of note that the systems which the Europeans have discarded are the systems in vogue among us. Their learned men continually make changes. We ignorantly adhere to their cast-off systems. They are trying each division to improve its own status. Wales is a small portion of England. Great efforts are being made to revive a knowledge of Welsh among Welshmen. The English Chancellor, Mr. Lloyd George, is taking a leading part in the movement to make Welsh children speak Welsh. And what is our condition? We write to each other in faulty English, and from this even, our M. A.'s are not free; our best thoughts are expressed in English; the proceedings of our Congress are conducted in English; our best newspapers are printed in English. If this state of things continues for a long time, posterity will—it is my firm opinion—condemn and curse us.
U||It is worth noting that, by receiving English education, we have enslaved the nation. Hypocrisy, tyranny, etc., have increased; English-knowing Indians have not hesitated to cheat and strike terror into the people. Now, if we are doing anything for the people at all, we are paying only a portion of the debt due to them.
U||Is it not a most painful thing that, if I want to go to a court of justice, I must employ the English language as medium; that, when I become a barrister, I may not speak my mother-tongue, and[Pg 102] that some one else should have to translate to me from my own language? Is not this absolutely absurd? Is it not a sign of slavery? Am I to blame the English for it or myself? It is we, the English-knowing men, that have enslaved India. The curse of the nation will rest not upon the English but upon us.
U||I have told you that my answer to your last question is both yes and no. I have explained to you why it is yes. I shall now explain why it is no.
U||We are so much beset by the disease of civilization, that we cannot altogether do without English education. Those who have already received it may make good use of it wherever necessary. In our dealings with the English people, in our dealings with our own people, when we can only correspond with them through that language, and for the purpose of knowing how much disgusted they (the English) have themselves become with their civilization, we may use or learn English, as the case may be. Those who have studied English will have to teach morality to their progeny through their mother-tongue, and to teach them another Indian language; but when they have grown up, they may learn English, the ultimate aim being that we should not need it. The object of making money thereby should be eschewed. Even in learning English to such a limited extent we will have to consider what we should learn through it[Pg 103] and what we should not. It will be necessary to know what sciences we should learn. A little thought should 
U||show you that immediately we cease to care for English degrees, the rulers will prick up their ears.
U||Reader: Then what education shall we give?
U||Editor: This has been somewhat considered above, but we will consider it a little more. I think that we have to improve all our languages. What subjects we should learn through them need not be elaborated here. Those English books which are valuable we should translate into the various Indian languages. We should abandon the pretension of learning many sciences. Religious, that is ethical, education will occupy the first place. Every cultured Indian will know in addition to his own provincial language, if a Hindu, Sanskrit; if a Mahomedan, Arabic; if a Parsee, Persian; and all, Hindi. Some Hindus should know Arabic and Persian; some Mahomedans and Parsees, Sanskrit. Several Northerners and Westerners should learn Tamil. A universal language for India should be Hindi, with the option of writing it in Persian or Nagric characters. In order that the Hindus and the Mahomedans may have closer relations, it is necessary to know both the characters. And, if we can do this, we can drive the English language out of t
U||he field in a short time. All this is necessary for us, slaves.[Pg 104] Through our slavery the nation has been enslaved, and it will be free with our freedom.
U||Reader: The question of religious education is very difficult.
U||Editor: Yet we cannot do without it. India will never be godless. Rank atheism cannot flourish in that land. The task is indeed difficult. My head begins to turn as I think of religious education. Our religious teachers are hypocritical and selfish; they will have to be approached. The Mullas, the Dasturs and the Brahmins hold the key in their hands, but if they will not have the good sense, the energy that we have derived from English education will have to be devoted to religious education. This is not very difficult. Only the fringe of the ocean has been polluted, and it is those who are within the fringe who alone need cleansing. We who come under this category can even cleanse ourselves, because my remarks do not apply to the millions. In order to restore India to its pristine condition, we have to return to it. In our own civilization, there will naturally be progress, retrogression, reforms, and reactions; but one effort is required, and that is to drive out Western civilization. All else will follow.
U||[Pg 105]
U||CHAPTER XIX
U||Machinery
U||Reader: When you speak of driving out Western civilization, I suppose you will also say that we want no machinery.
U||Editor: By raising this question, you have opened the wound I had received. When I read Mr. Dutt's Economic History of India I wept; and, as I think of it, again my heart sickens. It is machinery that has impoverished India. It is difficult to measure the harm that Manchester has done to us. It is due to Manchester that Indian handicraft has all but disappeared.
U||But I make a mistake. How can Manchester be blamed? We wore Manchester cloth, and that is why Manchester wove it. I was delighted when I read about the bravery of Bengal. There are no cloth-mills in that Presidency. They were, therefore, able to restore the original hand-weaving occupation. It is true Bengal encourages the mill-industry of Bombay. If Bengal had proclaimed a boycott of all machine-made goods, it would have been much better.
U||Machinery has begun to desolate Europe. Ruination is now knocking at the English gates. Machinery is the chief symbol of modern civilization; it represents a great sin.
U||The workers in the mills of Bombay have become slaves. The condition of the women working[Pg 106] in the mills is shocking. When there were no mills, these women were not starving. If the machinery craze grows in our country, it will become an unhappy land. It may be considered a heresy, but I am bound to say that it were better for us to send money to Manchester and to use flimsy Manchester cloth than to multiply mills in India. By using Manchester cloth we would only waste our money, but by reproducing Manchester in India, we shall keep our money at the price of our blood, because our very moral being will be sapped, and I call in support of my statement the very mill-hands as witnesses. And those who have amassed wealth out of factories are not likely to be better than other rich men. It would be folly to assume that an Indian Rockfeller would be better than the American Rockfeller. Impoverished India can become free, but it will be hard for an India, made rich through immorality, to regain its freedom. I
U|| fear we will have to admit that moneyed men support British rule; their interest is bound up with its stability. Money renders a man helpless. The other thing is as harmful as sexual vice. Both are poison. A snakebite is a lesser poison than these two, because the former merely destroys the body, but the latter destroys body, mind and soul. We need not, therefore, be pleased with the prospect of the growth of the mill-industry.[Pg 107]
U||Reader: Are the mills, then, to be closed down?
U||Editor: That is difficult. It is no easy task to do away with a thing that is established. We, therefore, say that the non-beginning of a thing is, supreme wisdom. We cannot condemn mill-owners, we can but pity them. It would be too much to expect them to give up their mills, but we may implore them not to increase them. If they would be good, they would gradually contract their business. They can establish in thousands of households the ancient and sacred handlooms, and they can buy out the cloth that may be thus woven. Whether the mill-owners do this or not, people can cease to use machine-made goods.
U||Reader: You have so far spoken about machine-made cloth, but there are innumerable machine-made things. We have either to import them or to introduce machinery into our country.
U||Editor: Indeed, our gods even are made in Germany. What need, then, to speak of matches, pins, and glassware? My answer can be only one. What did India do before these articles were introduced? Precisely the same should be done to-day. As long as we cannot make pins without machinery, so long will we do without them. The tinsel splendour of glassware we will have nothing to do with and we will make wicks, as of old, with home-grown cotton, and use hand-made earthern saucers for[Pg 108] lamps. So doing, we shall save our eyes and money, and will support Swadeshi, and so shall we attain Home Rule.
U||It is not to be conceived that all men will do all these things at one time, or that some men will give up all machine-made things at once. But, if the thought is sound, we will always find out what we can give up, and will gradually cease to use this. What a few may do, others will copy, and the movement will grow like the cocoanut of the mathematical problem. What the leaders do, the populace will gladly follow. The matter is neither complicated nor difficult. You and I shall not wait until we can carry others with us. Those will be the losers who will not do it, and those who will not do it, although they can appreciate the truth, will deserve to be called cowards.
U||Reader: What, then, of the tram-cars and electricity?
U||Editor: This question is now too late. It signifies nothing. If we are to do without the railways, we shall have to do without the tram-cars. Machinery is like a snake-hole which may contain from one to a hundred snakes. Where there is machinery there are large cities; and where there are large cities, there are tram-cars and railways; and there only does one see electric light. English villages do not boast any of these things. Honest physicians will tell you[Pg 109] that, where means of artificial locomotion have increased, the health of the people has suffered. I remember that, when in a European town there was a scarcity of money, the receipts of the tramway company, of the lawyers and of the doctors, went down, and the people were less unhealthy. I cannot recall a single good point in connection with machinery. Books can be written to demonstrate its evils.
U||Reader: It is a good point or a bad one that all you are saying will be printed through machinery?
U||Editor: This is one of those instances which demonstrate that sometimes poison is used to kill poison. This, then, will not be a good point regarding machinery. As it expires, the machinery, as it were, says to us: "Beware and avoid me. You will derive no benefit from me, and the benefit that may accrue from printing will avail only those who are infected with the machinery-craze." Do not, therefore, forget the main thing. It is necessary to realise that machinery is bad. We shall then be able gradually to do away with it. Nature has not provided any way whereby we may reach a desired goal all of a sudden. If, instead of welcoming machinery as a boon, we would look upon it as an evil, it would ultimately go.[Pg 110]
U||CHAPTER XX
U||Conclusion
U||Reader: From your views I gather that you would form a third party. You are neither an extremist nor a moderate.
U||Editor: That is a mistake. I do not think of a third party at all. We do not all think alike. We cannot say that all the moderates hold identical views. And how can those who want to serve only have a party? I would serve both the moderates and the extremists. Where I should differ from them, I would respectfully place my position before them, and continue my service.
U||Reader: What, then, would you say to both the parties?
U||Editor: I would say to the extremists:—"I know that you want Home Rule for India; it is not to be had for your asking. Everyone will have to take it for himself. What others get for me is not Home Rule but foreign rule; therefore, it would not be proper for you to say that you have obtained Home Rule, if you expelled the English. I have already described the true nature of Home Rule. This you would never obtain by force of arms. Brute-force is not natural to the Indian soil. You will have, therefore, to rely wholly on soul-force. You must not consider that violence is necessary at any stage for reaching our goal."[Pg 111]
U||I would say to the moderates:—"Mere petitioning is derogatory; we thereby confess inferiority. To say that British rule is indispensable, is almost a denial of the Godhead. We cannot say that anybody or anything is indispensable except God. Moreover, commonsense should tell us that to state that, for the time being, the presence of the English in India is a necessity, is to make them conceited.
U||"If the English vacated India bag and baggage, it must not be supposed that she would be widowed. It is possible that those who are forced to observe peace under their pressure would fight after their withdrawal. There can be no advantage in suppressing an eruption, it must have its vent. If, therefore, before we can remain at peace, we must fight amongst ourselves, it is better that we do so. There is no occasion for a third party to protect the weak. It is this so-called protection which has unnerved us. Such protection can only make the weak weaker. Unless we realise this, we cannot have Home Rule. I would paraphrase the thought of an English divine and say that anarchy under home rule were better than orderly foreign rule. Only, the meaning that the learned divine attached to home rule is different to Indian Home Rule according to my conception. We have to learn, and to teach others, that we do[Pg 112] not want the tyranny of their English rule or Indian rule."
U||If this idea were carried out both the extremists and the moderates could join hands. There is no occasion to fear or distrust one another.
U||Reader: What, then, would you say to the English?
U||Editor: To them I would respectfully say: "I admit you are my rulers. It is not necessary to debate the question whether you hold India by the sword or by my consent. I have no objection to your remaining in my country, but although you are the rulers, you will have to remain as servants of the people. It is not we who have to do as you wish, but it is you who have to do as we wish. You may keep the riches that you have drained away from this land, but you may not drain riches henceforth. Your function will be, if you so wish, to police India; you must abandon the idea of deriving any commercial benefit from us. We hold the civilization that you support to be the reverse of civilization. We consider our civilization to be far superior to yours. If you realise this truth, it will be to your advantage, and, if you do not, according to your own proverb, you should only live in our country in the same manner as we do. You must not do anything that is contrary to our religions. It is your duty as rulers that, for
U|| the sake of the[Pg 113] Hindus, you should eschew beef, and for the sake of the Mahomedans, you should avoid bacon and ham. We have hitherto said nothing, because we have been cowed down, but you need not consider that you have not hurt our feelings by your conduct. We are not expressing our sentiments either through base selfishness or fear, but because it is our duty now to speak out boldly. We consider your schools and law courts to be useless. We want our own ancient schools and courts to be restored. The common language of India is not English but Hindi. You should, therefore, learn it. We can hold communication with you only in our national language.
U||"We cannot tolerate the idea of your spending money on railways and the military. We see no occasion for either. You may fear Russia; we do not. When she comes we will look after her. If you are with us, we will then receive her jointly. We do not need any European cloth. We will manage with articles produced and manufactured at home. You may not keep one eye on Manchester and the other on India. We can work together only if our interests are identical.
U||"This has not been said to you in arrogance. You have great military resources. Your naval power is matchless. If we wanted to fight with you on your own ground we would be unable to do so, but, if the above submissions be not acceptable[Pg 114] to you, we cease to play the ruled. You may, if you like, cut us to pieces. You may shatter us at the cannon's mouth. If you act contrary to our will, we will not help you and, without our help, we know that you cannot move one step forward.
U||"It is likely that you will laugh at all this in the intoxication of your power. We may not be able to disillusion you at once, but, if there be any manliness in us, you will see shortly that your intoxication is suicidal, and that your laugh at our expense is an aberration of intellect. We believe that, at heart you belong to a religious nation. We are living in a land which is the source of religions. How we came together need not be considered, but we can make mutual good use of our relations.
U||"You English who have come to India are not a good specimen of the English nation, nor can we almost half Anglicised Indians, be considered a good specimen of the real Indian nation. If the English nation were to know all you have done, it would oppose many of your actions. The mass of the Indians have had few dealings with you. If you will abandon your so-called civilization, and search into your own scriptures, you will find that our demands are just. Only on conditions of our demands being fully satisfied may you remain in India, and, if you remain under those conditions we shall learn several things from you, and you will learn many from us. So doing, we shall benefit[Pg 115] each other and the world. But that will happen only when the root of our relationship is sunk in a religious soil."
U||Reader: What will you say to the nation?
U||Editor: Who is the nation?
U||Reader: For our purposes it is the nation that you and I have been thinking of, that is, those of us who are affected by European civilization, and who are eager to have Home Rule.
U||Editor: To these I would say: It is only those Indians who are imbued with real love who will be able to speak to the English in the above strain without being frightened, and those only can be said to be so imbued who conscientiously believe that Indian civilization is the best, and that European is a nine days' wonder. Such ephemeral civilizations have often come and gone, and will continue to do so. Those only can be considered to be so imbued, who, having experienced the force of the soul within themselves, will not cower before brute-force, and will not, on any account, desire to use brute-force. Those only can be considered to have been so imbued who are intensely dissatisfied with the present pitiable condition having already drunk the cup of poison.
U||If there be only one such Indian, he will speak as above to the English, and the English will have to listen to him.[Pg 116]
U||These demands are not demands, but they show our mental state. We will get nothing by asking; we shall have to take what we want, and we need the requisite strength for the effort and that strength will be available to him only who
U||    1. will, only on rare occasions, make use of the English language;
U||    2. if a lawyer, will give up his profession and take up a hand-loom;
U||    3. if a lawyer, will devote his knowledge to enlightening both his people and the English;
U||    4. if a lawyer, will not meddle with the quarrels between parties, but will give up the courts and from his experience induce the people to do likewise;
U||    5. if a lawyer, will refuse to be a judge, as the will give up his profession;
U||    6. if a doctor, will give up medicine, and understand that rather than mending bodies, he should mend souls;
U||    7. if a doctor, will understand, that no matter to what religion he belongs, it is better that bodies remain diseased rather than that they are cured through the instrumentality of the diabolical vivisection that is practised in European schools of medicine;[Pg 117]
U||    8. although a doctor, will take up a hand-loom and, if any patients come to him, will tell them the cause of their diseases, and will advise them to remove the cause, rather than pamper them by giving useless drugs; he will understand that, if by not taking drugs, perchance the patient dies, the world will not come to grief, and that he will have been really merciful to him;
U||    9. although a wealthy man, regardless of his wealth, will speak out his mind and fear no one;
U||    10. if a wealthy man, will devote his money to establishing hand-looms, and encourage others to use hand-made goods by wearing them himself;
U||    11. like every other Indian, will know that this is a time for repentance, expiation and mourning;
U||    12. like every other Indian, will know that to blame the English is useless, that they came because of us, and remain also for the same reason, and that they will either go or change their nature, only when we reform ourselves;
U||    13. like others, will understand that, at a time of mourning, there can be no indulgence, and that, whilst we are in a fallen state, to[Pg 118] be in gaol or in banishment is much the best;
U||    14. like others, will know that it is superstition to imagine it necessary that we should guard against being imprisoned in order that we may deal with the people;
U||    15. like others, will know that action is much better than speech; that it is our duty to say exactly what we think and face the consequences, and that it will be only then that we shall be able to impress anybody with our speech;
U||    16. like others, will understand that we will become free only through suffering;
U||    17. like others, will understand that deportation for life to the Andamans is not enough expiation for the sin of encouraging European civilization;
U||    18. like others, will know that no nation has risen without suffering; that, even in physical warfare, the true test is suffering and not the killing of others, much more so in the warfare of passive resistance;
U||    19. like others, will know that it is an idle excuse to say that we will do a thing when the others also do it; that we should do what we know to be right, and that others will do it when they see the way; that when[Pg 119] I fancy a particular delicacy, I do not wait till others taste it; that to make a national effort and to suffer are in the nature of delicacies; and that to suffer under pressure is no suffering.
U||Reader: This is a large order. When will all carry it out?
U||Editor: You make a mistake. You and I have nothing to do with the others. Let each do his duty. If I do my duty, that is, serve myself, I shall be able to serve others. Before I leave you, I will take the liberty of repeating.
U||    1. Real home-rule is self-rule or self-control.
U||    2. The way to it is passive resistance: that is soul force or love-force.
U||    3. In order to exert this force, Swadeshi in every sense is necessary.
U||    4. What we want to do should be done, not because we object to the English or that we want to retaliate, but because it is our duty to do so. Thus, supposing that the English remove the salt-tax, restore our money, give the highest posts to Indians, withdraw the English troops, we shall certainly not use their machine-made goods, nor use the English language, nor many of their industries. It is worth nothing that these things are, in their[Pg 120] nature, harmful; hence, we do not want them. I bear no enmity towards the English, but I do towards their civilization.
U||In my opinion, we have used the term "Swaraj" without understanding its real significance. I have endeavoured to explain it as I understand it, and my conscience testifies that my life henceforth is dedicated to its attainment.

U||"On the other hand when we read with attention the poetical and philosophical movements of the East, above all, those of India, which are beginning to spread in Europe, we discover there so many truths, and truths so profound, and which make such a contrast with the meanness of the results at which the European genius has sometimes stopped, that we are constrained to bend the knee before that of the East, and to see in this cradle of the human race the native land of the highest philosophy."[Pg 123]

U||"It cannot be too well understood that our position in India has never been in any degree that of civilians bringing civilization to savage races. When we landed in India we found there a hoary civilization, which, during the progress of thousands of years, had fitted itself into the character and adjusted itself to the wants of highly intellectual races. The civilization was not prefunctory, but universal and all-pervading—furnishing the country not only with political systems but with social and domestic institutions of the most ramified description. The beneficent nature of these institutions as a whole may be judged of from their effects on the character of the Hindu race. Perhaps there are no other people in the world who show so much in their characters the advantageous effects of their own civilization. They are shrewd in business, acute in reasoning, thrifty, religious, sober, charitable, obedient to parents, reverential to old age, amiable, law-abiding, compassionate towards the helpless, and pati

U||"If a good system of agriculture, unrivalled manufacturing skill, a capacity to produce whatever can contribute to convenience or luxury; schools established in every village, for teaching, reading, writing and arithmetic; the general practice of hospitality and charity among each other; and, above all, treatment of the female sex, full of confidence, respect and delicacy, are among the signs which denote a civilised people, then the Hindus are not inferior to the nations of Europe; and if civilization is to become an article of trade between the two[Pg 125] countries, I am convinced that this country [England] will gain by the import cargo."
U||Frederick von Schlegel.
U||"It cannot be denied that the early Indians possessed a knowledge of the true God; all their writings are replete with sentiments and expressions noble, clear and severely grand, as deeply conceived and reverently expressed as in any human language in which men have spoken of their God.... Among nations possessing indigenous philosophy and metaphysics, together with an innate relish for these pursuits, such as at present characterises Germany; and in olden times, was the proud distinction of Greece, Hindustan holds the first rank in point of time."
U||Sir William Wedderburn, Bart.
U||"The Indian village has thus for centuries remained a bulwark against political disorder, and the home of the simple domestic and social virtues. No wonder, therefore, that philosophers and historians have always dwelt lovingly on this ancient institution which is the natural social unit and the best type of rural life; self-contained, industrious, peace-loving, conservative in the best sense of the word.... I think you will agree with me that there is much that is both picturesque and attractive in this glimpse of social and domestic life in an Indian village. It is a harmless and happy form of human existence. Moreover, it is not without good practical outcome."[Pg 126]

U||"Those races, [the Indian viewed from a moral aspect] are perhaps the most remarkable people in the world. They breathe an atmosphere of moral purity, which cannot but excite admiration, and this is especially the case with the poorer classes who, notwithstanding the privations of their humble lot, appear to be happy and contented. True children of nature, they live on from day to day, taking no thought of to-morrow and thankful for the simple fare which Providence has provided for them. It is curious to witness the spectacle of coolies of both sexes returning home at nightfall after a hard day's work often lasting from sunrise to sunset. In spite of fatigue from the effects of the unremitting toil, they are, for the most part, gay and animated, conversing cheerfully together and occasionally breaking into snatches of light-hearted song. Yet what awaits them on their return to the hovels which they call home? A dish of rice for food, and the floor for a bed. Domestic felicity appears to be the rule among the
U|| Natives, and this is the more strange when the customs of marriage are taken into account, parents arranging all such matters. Many Indian households afford examples of the married state in its highest degree of perfection. This may be due to the[Pg 127] teachings of the Shastras, and to the strict injunctions which they inculcate with regard to marital obligations; but it is no exaggeration to say that husbands are generally devotedly attached to their wives, and in many instances the latter have the most exalted conception of their duties towards their husbands."
U||Abbe J. A. Dubois.
U||Missionary in Mysore. Extracts from letter dated Seringapatam, 15th December, 1820.
U||"The authority of married women within their houses is chiefly exerted in preserving good order and peace among the persons who compose their families: and a great many among them discharge this important duty with a prudence and a discretion which have scarcely a parallel in Europe. I have known families composed of between thirty and forty persons, or more, consisting of grown-up sons and daughters, all married and all having children, living together under the superintendence of an old matron—their mother or mother-in-law. The latter, by good management, and by accommodating herself to the temper of the daughters-in-law, by using, according to circumstances, firmness or forbearance, succeeded in preserving peace and harmony during many years amongst so many females, who had all jarring interests, and still more jarring tempers. I ask you whether it would be[Pg 128] possible to attain the same end, in the same circumstances, in our countries, where it is scarcely possible to make two women living under t
U||he same foot to agree together.
U||"In fact, there is perhaps no kind of honest employment in a civilised country in which the Hindu females have not a due share. Besides the management of the household, and the care of the family, which (as already noticed) under their control, the wives and daughters of husbandmen attend and assist their husbands and fathers in the labours of agriculture. Those of tradesmen assist theirs in carrying on their trade. Merchants are attended and assisted by theirs in their shops. Many females are shopkeepers on their own account and without a knowledge of the alphabet or of the decimal scale, they keep by other means their accounts in excellent order, and are considered as still shrewder than the males themselves in their commercial dealings."

U||Books on Liberty and Freedom
U||The Ideal of Swaraj.
U||    In Education and Government by Nirpendra Chandra Banerjee with an introduction by C. F. Andrews.
U||    Those who are out of sheer prejudice and incapacity for political thought, sneer, at the goal of Swaraj proclaimed by the National Congress as merely a destructive and at best a visionary ideal as well as those who in spite of their approval of the goal are unable to visualise it in concrete contents, will do well to read this interesting and instructive book by an ardent Bengali patriot and ex-school master. The author has political insight, and faith in the country's capacity. He recognises that the soul of India is in her numerous villages in rural centres and has given out practical suggestions for national reconstruction along sound lines.
U||    Mr. Andrews has written an introduction to the volume wherein he has dealt with the value of the Swaraj ideal and his own conception of the same. It is a useful publication worthy to be placed in the hands of our young men and women.—Hindu.

U||India's Will to Freedom.
U||    By Lala Lajpat Rai. A collection of Writings and Addresses on the present situation and the work before us. "We in India should, one and all, take a vow that whether we have to lay down our life, whether we are mutilated or hanged, whether our women and children are mal-treated, our desire for Swaraj will never grow a little any the less. Every child of this land, whatever his religion or persuasion, should swear that, as long as there is life in his limbs, or breath in his nostrils, he would strive for national liberty."

U||Footsteps of Freedom.
U||    By James H. Cousins. "Another stunt which will also be vigorously vamped by the opponents of dyarehy, in fact of all reform will be the absolute necessity of politically educating the masses of India before giving them any measure of political freedom. In a book of charming essays which he has just published through Messrs. Ganesh & Co., of Madras, under the title of "Footsteps of Freedom" Mr. James Cousins attacks this particular fallacy and shatters it convincingly." Ditcher in Capital.

Rajagopalachar.
U||    "The war that the people of India have declared and which will purify and consolidate India, and forge for her a true and stable liberty is a war with the latest and most effective weapon. In this war, what has hitherto been in the world an undesirable but necessary incident in freedom's battles, the killing of innocent men has been eliminated; and that which is the true essential for forging liberty, the self-purification and self-strengthening of men and women has been kept pure and unalloyed."

U||1.F.
U||1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
U||1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees.

LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund.

If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.
U||1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
U||1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
U||1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
U||Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
U||Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
U||Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
U||Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
U||The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
U||The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
U||Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
U||Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
U||The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
U||While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
U||International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
U||Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
U||Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
U||Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
U||Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
U||Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.
U||This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

U||MAHATMA GANDHI
U||    LA GRANDE AME MAHATMA…[1]
U||    l’Homme qui s’est fait un avec l’Etre de l’univers.
1||C’est le sens littéral de ce nom, qui fut décerné à Gandhi par le peuple de l’Inde : Mahâ, grande ; Atmâ, âme. Le mot remonte aux Upanishads, où il désigne l’Etre suprême, et, par communion de connaissance et d’amour, ceux qui s’unifient à lui :
U||Il est l’Un lumineux, le Créateur de Tout, le Mahâtmâ,
U||Toujours dans le cœur des peuples établi,
U||Révélé par le cœur], par l’intuition, par l’intelligence.
U||Celui qui le connaît, il devient immortel.
U||Tagore, visitant en décembre 1922 l’Ashram (retraite favorite de Gandhi), cita ce beau verset, en l’appliquant à l’apôtre.
U||I
U||De tranquilles yeux sombres. Un petit homme débile, la face maigre, aux grandes oreilles écartées. Coiffé d’un bonnet blanc, vêtu d’étoffe blanche rude, les pieds nus. Il se nourrit de riz, de fruits, il ne boit que de l’eau, il couche sur le plancher, il dort peu, il travaille sans cesse. Son corps ne semble pas compter. Rien ne frappe en lui, d’abord, qu’une expression de grande patience et de grand amour. Pearson, qui le voit en 1913, au Sud-Afrique, pense à François d’Assise. Il est simple comme un enfant[2], doux et poli même avec ses adversaires[3], d’une sincérité immaculée[4]. Il se juge avec modestie, scrupuleux au point de paraître hésiter et de dire : « Je me suis trompé » ; ne cache jamais ses erreurs, ne fait jamais de compromis, n’a aucune diplomatie, fuit l’effet oratoire, ou mieux n’y pense pas[5] ; répugne aux manifestations populaires que sa personne déchaîne, et où sa chétive stature risquerait, certains jours, d’être écrasée, sans son
U|| ami Maulana Shaukat Ali, qui lui fait un rempart de son corps athlétique ; littéralement malade de la multitude qui l’adore[6] ; au fond, ayant la méfiance du nombre et l’aversion de la Mobocracy, de la populace lâchée ; il ne se sent à l’aise que dans la minorité, et heureux que dans la solitude, écoutant la still small voice (la petite voix silencieuse), qui commande[7]…

3||« Peu d’hommes peuvent résister au charme de sa personnalité. Ses plus violents adversaires sont rendus courtois par sa belle courtoisie ».
U||(Joseph J. Doke).
4||« Tout écart de la vérité, même en passant, lui est intolérable ».
U||(C.-F. Andrews).
5||« Il n’est pas un orateur passionné ; sa manière est calme et lente ; il s’adresse surtout à l’intelligence. Mais sa tranquillité place les sujets sous le jour le plus limpide. Ses inflexions de voix sont peu variées, mais d’une sincérité intense. Jamais il n’agite les bras, il remue rarement un doigt en parlant. Sa parole lumineuse, qui s’exprime par sentences nerveuses, emporte la conviction. Il ne lâche aucun point, avant d’être sûr qu’il est bien compris ».

U||Voici l’homme qui a soulevé trois cent millions d’hommes, ébranlé le British Empire, et inauguré dans la politique humaine le plus puissant mouvement depuis près de deux mille ans.
U||De son vrai nom, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Il est né dans un petit État semi-indépendant, au nord-ouest de l’Inde, à Porbandar, la ville blanche, sur la mer d’Oman, le 2 octobre 1869. Race ardente, remuante, hier encore agitée par les guerres civiles. Race pratique, ayant le sens des affaires, et rayonnant pour son commerce d’Aden à Zanzibar. Son grand-père et son père furent tous deux premiers-ministres, tous deux disgraciés pour leur indépendance, forcés de fuir, et leur vie menacée. Il sortait d’un milieu riche, intelligent, cultivé, mais non de la caste supérieure. Ses parents appartenaient à l’école Jaïn de l’Hindouisme, dont un des grands principes est l’Ahimsâ[8], qu’il devait victorieusement affirmer dans le monde.
8||A : privatif, Himsâ, faire du mal. Non-injure à toute vie. Non-violence. Un des plus anciens principes de la religion hindoue, particulièrement affirmé par Mahâvira, fondateur du Jaïnisme, par Buddha, ainsi que par les champions du culte de Vishnu, qui eut beaucoup d’influence sur Gandhi.
U||Pour les Jaïnistes, l’amour plus que l’intelligence est la voie qui mène à Dieu. Le père du Mahâtmâ n’attachait aucun prix à l’argent, et en laissa peu aux siens, ayant presque tout dépensé en charités. La mère, sévèrement religieuse, était une Sainte Elisabeth hindoue, jeûnant, faisant l’aumône et veillant les malades. On lisait régulièrement le Râmâyana, dans la famille. Sa première éducation fut confiée à un Brahmane, qui lui faisait répéter les textes de Vishnu[9]. Mais plus tard, il s’est plaint de n’avoir jamais été grand clerc en sanscrit : une de ses rancunes contre l’éducation anglaise, qui lui fit perdre les trésors de sa langue. Il est cependant très instruit des Écritures hindoues ; mais il ne lit les Vedas et les Upanishads que dans des traductions[10].
9||Il étudia jusqu’à sept ans à l’école élémentaire de Porbandar, puis à l’école publique de Rajkot ; après dix ans, à la High School de Katyavar, enfin à dix-sept ans à l’Université d’Ahmedabad.
U||[10] Il a raconté son enfance, dans un discours familier, à la Conférence des classes intouchables (parias), le 13 avril 1921.
U||Il passa par une grave crise religieuse, tandis qu’il était encore à l’école. Par révolte contre l’hindouisme idolâtre et dégénéré, il fut — il crut être — pendant quelque temps un athée. Avec des camarades, il alla, dans son impiété, jusqu’à manger de la viande en cachette (le plus affreux des sacrilèges, pour un Hindou !) Il en faillit mourir d’horreur et de dégoût[11].
U||[11] Plus tard, il fit part de ses transes à Joseph J. Doke. Il en perdit le sommeil ; il se croyait un meurtrier.
U||Marié encore enfant[12], il alla, à dix-neuf ans, compléter ses études en Angleterre, à l’Université de Londres et à l’École de Droit. Sa mère ne consentit à le laisser partir qu’après lui avoir fait prendre les trois vœux Jaïns qui obligent à l’abstention du vin, de la viande et des relations sexuelles.
U||[12] Fiancé à huit ans, marié à douze ans. Par la suite, il combattit les mariages d’enfants, où il voit une cause de ruine pour la race. Cependant, il ajoute qu’exceptionnellement une telle union pour la vie, commencée avant que le caractère soit formé, peut produire entre les époux une merveilleuse unité d’âme. Son propre mariage en a été un exemple admirable. Mme Gandhi a partagé toutes les épreuves de son mari, avec une fidélité et un courage qui ne se sont jamais démentis.
U||Il arriva à Londres, en septembre 1888. Après les premiers mois d’incertitude et de déceptions — il avait gaspillé naïvement beaucoup de temps et d’argent, pour devenir, dit-il, un gentleman anglais, — il s’astreignit à une vie stricte et à un travail sévère. Des amis lui firent connaître la Bible ; mais l’heure n’était pas encore venue pour lui de la comprendre. Il fut lassé par les premiers livres, et n’alla pas plus loin que l’Exode. Au contraire, ce fut à Londres qu’il découvrit la beauté de la Bhagavad Gîtâ. Il en fut enivré. Elle était la lumière dont avait besoin le petit Indien exilé. Elle lui rendit la foi. Il reconnut que « pour lui, le salut était possible seulement par la religion hindoue[13] ».
U||[13] Discours du 13 avril 1921.
U||Il retourna aux Indes, en 1891. Triste retour. Sa mère venait de mourir, et on lui avait caché la nouvelle. Il devint avocat à la Haute-Cour de Bombay. Quelques années plus tard, il devait renoncer à sa profession, qu’il jugea immorale. Même aux temps où il la remplit, il se réservait le droit d’abandonner une cause, quand l’injustice lui en apparaissait.
U||Déjà à cette époque, de grandes personnalités indiennes éveillaient en lui des pressentiments de sa mission future : « le roi sans couronne » de Bombay : le Parsi Dadabhai, et le professeur Gokhale, tous deux brûlant d’un religieux amour pour l’Inde : Gokhale, un des meilleurs hommes d’État de sa patrie, et des premiers à restaurer l’éducation indienne ; Dadabhai, fondateur du nationalisme indien (au témoignage de Gandhi)[14] ; tous deux aussi, maîtres de sagesse et de douceur. Ce fut Dadabhai qui, contrôlant l’ardeur juvénile de Gandhi, lui donna en 1892 sa première leçon pratique de Ahimsâ dans la vie publique : la passivité héroïque, s’il est possible de joindre ces deux mots, l’élan passionné de l’âme qui résiste au mal, non par le mal, mais par l’amour. Nous reviendrons sur cette parole magique, sublime message que l’Inde adresse au monde.
U||[14] Ces Précurseurs, dont la hardiesse politique a été bien dépassée, ont souffert de l’ingratitude et de l’oubli des générations nouvelles. Mais Gandhi leur est resté fidèle, particulièrement à Gokhale, avec qui il était lié par une pieuse affection. A diverses reprises, il impose son nom et celui de Dadabhai à la vénération de la Jeune Inde. (Voir Hind Swarâj, la Lettre aux Parsis du 23 mars 1921, et la Profession de foi du 13 juillet 1921).
U||C’est en 1893 que commence l’action indienne de Gandhi. Elle se divise en deux périodes. De 1893 à 1914, elle a pour champ l’Afrique du Sud. Depuis 1914, elle s’exerce sur l’Inde.
U||Que cette action de vingt ans au Sud-Afrique n’ait pas eu plus de retentissement en Europe, est une preuve de l’incroyable étroitesse d’horizon de nos hommes politiques, de nos historiens, de nos penseurs et de nos hommes de foi : car c’est une épopée de l’âme, sans égale en notre temps, non seulement par la puissance et la constance du sacrifice, mais par sa victoire finale.
U||En 1890-91 se trouvaient installés dans l’Afrique du Sud, principalement au Natal, 150.000 Indiens. L’afflux de ce peuple étranger provoqua dans la population blanche une xénophobie, que le gouvernement se chargea d’interpréter par des mesures d’ostracisme. Il voulut interdire l’immigration des Asiatiques, et forcer à partir ceux qui étaient établis dans le pays. Des persécutions systématiques leur rendirent la vie intolérable : taxes accablantes, humiliantes obligations de police, outrages publics, et bientôt lynchages, pillages et destructions, sous l’égide de la civilisation blanche.
U||En 1893, Gandhi arriva en Sud-Afrique, appelé à Pretoria pour plaider une cause importante. Il était dans l’ignorance complète de la situation des Indiens en Afrique. Dès ses premiers pas à Natal, mais surtout au Transvaal hollandais, il fit des expériences cruelles. Cet Hindou de haute race, qui avait toujours été bien traité en Angleterre et qui, jusque-là, considérait les Européens comme des amis, se trouva en butte aux plus grossières avanies, jeté à la porte des hôtels et des trains, insulté, souffleté, frappé à coups de pied. Il fût reparti sur-le-champ pour l’Inde, s’il n’avait eu un contrat qui le liait pour douze mois avec ses clients. Pendant ces douze mois, il apprit la maîtrise sur soi-même. Mais le terme venu, il avait hâte de repartir, quand il sut que le gouvernement préparait un projet de loi qui enlevait aux Indiens leurs dernières franchises. Les Indiens d’Afrique étaient sans forces pour lutter, sans volonté, inorganisés, démoralisés. Il leur falla
U||it un chef, une âme. Gandhi se dévoua. Il resta.
U||Alors, s’ouvre la lutte épique d’une conscience contre la force de l’État et de la masse brutale. Encore avocat à cette époque, il commença par démontrer juridiquement l’illégalité de l’Acte d’exclusion asiatique ; et, contre la plus virulente opposition, il gagna sa cause, en droit, sinon en fait, devant l’opinion de Natal et de Londres. Il fait signer d’énormes pétitions, suscite le Congrès indien de Natal, forme une Association d’éducation indienne ; un peu plus tard, il fonde un journal, Indian Opinion, publié en anglais et en trois langues indiennes. Puis, voulant assurer à ses compatriotes un régime honorable en Afrique, afin de mieux les défendre, il se rend pareil à eux. Il avait à Johannesburg une clientèle lucrative[15] : il l’abandonna pour épouser, comme François, la Pauvreté. Avec les Indiens misérables et persécutés, il fait vie commune ; il partage leurs épreuves, et il les sanctifie : car il leur impose la loi de Non-Résistance. Il crée, e
U||n 1904, à Phœnix, près de Durban, une colonie agricole, sur les plans de Tolstoy, qu’il admirait[16]. Il y rassemble les Indiens, leur fournit des terrains, et leur fait prendre le vœu solennel de pauvreté. Lui-même se charge des tâches les plus serviles. Là, pendant des années, ce peuple silencieux résiste au gouvernement. Il s’est retiré des villes ; la vie industrielle du pays en est paralysée. C’est une grève religieuse, contre laquelle toute violence se brise, comme celle de la Rome impériale contre les premiers Chrétiens. Mais bien peu de ces chrétiens auraient porté la doctrine de pardon et d’amour jusqu’au point de venir, comme Gandhi, au secours de leurs persécuteurs menacés. Chaque fois que l’État du Sud-Afrique se trouva aux prises avec de graves dangers, Gandhi suspendit la non-participation des Indiens aux services publics, et offrit aussitôt son aide. En 1899, pendant la guerre des Boers, il forma une Croix-Rouge indienne, qui fut deux fois citée à l’ordre
U|| du jour, avec éloges pour sa bravoure sous le feu. En 1904, la peste éclata à Johannesburg : Gandhi organisa un hôpital. En 1906, les indigènes se soulevèrent au Natal : Gandhi prit part à la guerre, à la tête d’un corps de brancardiers, et le gouvernement de Natal l’en remercia publiquement.
U||[15] Il gagnait, dit Gokhale, 5 à 6.000 livres par an. Dorénavant, il vécut de trois livres par mois.
U||[16] The Golden Number of Indian Opinion, publié à Phœnix, en 1914, reproduit une longue lettre de Tolstoy à Gandhi, écrite le 7 septembre 1910, peu avant sa mort. Tolstoy avait lu l’Indian Opinion, et il se réjouissait de ce qu’il y avait appris des non-résistants Indiens. Il encourage le mouvement et dit que « la non-résistance est la loi de l’amour, c’est-à-dire l’aspiration à la communion des âmes humaines », C’est la loi promulguée par Christ et les sages du monde entier.
U||Notre ami Paul Birukoff a retrouvé dans l’Archive Tolstoy, à Moscou, d’autres lettres de Tolstoy à Gandhi. Il va les publier, avec une collection de lettres de Tolstoy à des Asiatiques, sous le titre général : Tolstoy et l’Orient.
U||Ces services chevaleresques ne désarmaient pas la fureur xénophobe. Jeté en prison à diverses reprises[17] — (et même peu après les remerciements officiels pour la guerre du Natal) — condamné à la réclusion et aux travaux forcés, bâtonné par la populace furieuse[18], une fois laissé pour mort, Gandhi connut toutes les souffrances et toutes les humiliations. Rien n’altéra sa foi. Elle grandit par l’épreuve. C’est en 1908 qu’il écrivit, en réponse à l’école de la violence dans l’Afrique du Sud, son fameux petit livre : Hind Swarâj (Home Rule Indien), l’Évangile de l’amour héroïque[19].
U||[17] Il a raconté lui-même, avec une tranquille bonhomie, ses expériences de prison, en un curieux article, reproduit dans le volume : Speeches and writings of M. K. Gandhi, Natesan, Madras, pages 152-178.
U||[18] En 1907, par ses propres compatriotes : car il eut à la fois à souffrir de la violence des oppresseurs et de celle des opprimés ; à ceux-ci la modération de Gandhi était suspecte, et le gouvernement faisait ce qu’il pouvait pour le compromettre.
U||[19] J’y reviendrai plus loin.
U||La lutte se maintint pendant vingt ans, et elle atteignit son maximum d’âpreté entre 1907 et 1914. Le gouvernement du Sud-Afrique avait fait passer précipitamment un nouvel Acte asiatique, malgré l’opposition des Anglais éclairés. Alors, Gandhi organisa la Non-Résistance, dans toute son ampleur. En septembre 1906, à Johannesburg, fut prêté solennellement par les Indiens réunis le serment de « Résistance passive ». Tous les Asiatiques, de toute race, de toute caste, de toute religion, riches et pauvres, y apportèrent la même abnégation ; les Chinois d’Afrique s’unirent étroitement aux Indiens. On les emprisonna par milliers ; faute de prisons assez grandes, on les enferma dans les mines. Mais la prison semblait exercer un attrait sur eux. Le général Smuts, qui les persécutait, leur avait donné le nom de Conscientious Objectors. Gandhi fut incarcéré trois fois[20]. Il y eut des morts, des martyrs. Le mouvement grandit. En 1913, il s’étendit du Transvaal au Natal. De f
U||ormidables grèves, des meetings passionnés, une marche en masse des Indiens à travers le Transvaal, surexcitèrent l’opinion en Afrique et en Asie. L’indignation gagna l’Inde, et le vice-roi, lord Harding, s’en fit lui-même, à Madras, l’interprète retentissant.
U||[20] Joseph J. Doke, dont les entretiens avec Gandhi au Transvaal sont si révélateurs, termine son livre en octobre 1908, sur la vision de Gandhi en costume de forçat, conduit au fort de Johannesburg, et jeté dans un cachot avec d’ignobles criminels Chinois de droit commun.
U||L’indomptable ténacité et la magie de la grande âme opéraient : la force plia les genoux devant l’héroïque douceur[21]. Le plus acharné contre la cause indienne, le général Smuts qui, en 1909, déclarait qu’il n’effacerait jamais du Livre des Statuts une mesure injurieuse pour les Indiens, s’avoua, cinq ans après, heureux de la faire disparaître[22]. Une Commission impériale donna raison à Gandhi sur presque tous les points. En 1914, un Acte supprima l’impôt de trois livres, et accorda la liberté de résidence dans le Natal à tous les Indiens qui voulaient y rester comme travailleurs libres. Après vingt ans de sacrifices, la Non-Résistance avait vaincu.
U||[21] L’intervention de deux nobles Anglais : C.-F. Andrews et W.-W. Pearson, seconda efficacement les efforts de Gandhi.
U||[22] Gandhi rappelle le fait, dans un article du 12 mai 1920.
U||Gandhi retourna dans l’Inde, avec le prestige d’un chef.
U||Le mouvement d’indépendance nationale s’y annonçait, depuis le commencement du siècle. Une trentaine d’années avant, le Congrès National Indien avait été fondé par quelques Anglais intelligents : A. O. Hume, sir William Wedderburn, libéraux victoriens, qui longtemps lui avaient maintenu un caractère loyaliste, tâchant de concilier les intérêts de l’Inde avec la souveraineté anglaise. La victoire du Japon sur la Russie réveilla l’orgueil asiatique, et les provocations de lord Curzon blessèrent les patriotes indiens. Au sein du Congrès se forma un parti extrémiste, dont le nationalisme agressif trouva des échos dans le pays. Pourtant, le vieux parti constitutionnel resta, jusqu’à la guerre mondiale, sous l’influence de J. H. Gokhale, sincèrement patriote, mais fidèle à l’Angleterre, et le sentiment national, qui dès lors pénétrait cette Assemblée des représentants de l’Inde, les acheminait tous vers la revendication d’un Home Rule (Swarâj), sur le sens duquel il
U||s n’étaient pas d’accord : ceux-ci, s’accommodant de la coopération anglaise, ceux-là voulant chasser de l’Inde les Européens ; les uns prenant modèle sur le Canada et l’Afrique du Sud, les autres sur le Japon. Gandhi apportait sa solution, moins politique que religieuse, plus radicale au fond que toutes les autres (Hind Swarâj). Il lui manquait, pour l’adapter aux réalités pratiques, une connaissance exacte du milieu : car, si sa longue mission au Sud-Afrique lui avait été une expérience prodigieuse de l’âme hindoue et de l’arme irrésistible de l’Ahimsâ, il était resté vingt-trois ans éloigné de son pays. Il se recueillit et observa[23].
U||[23] Son maître aimé, Gokhale, qui venait de mourir, lui avait fait promettre qu’il ne se mêlerait pas à la politique active, avant d’avoir, au moins pendant un an, fait le tour de l’Inde et revu de près son peuple, avec qui il avait perdu contact.
U||Il était encore si loin de songer à la révolte contre l’Empire que, lorsque la guerre éclata, en 1914, il se rendit en Angleterre, pour y lever un corps d’ambulanciers. « Il croyait honnêtement (écrit-il en 1921) qu’il était citoyen de l’Empire. » Il le rappellera, maintes fois, dans ses lettres de 1920 à tous les Anglais de l’Inde : « Chers amis, nul Anglais n’a coopéré plus étroitement que moi à l’Empire, pendant vingt-neuf ans d’activité publique. J’ai mis ma vie quatre fois en danger pour l’Angleterre… Jusqu’en 1919, j’ai parlé pour la coopération, avec une conviction sincère… »
U||Il n’était pas le seul. L’Inde entière s’était laissée prendre, en 1914, à l’idéalisme hypocrite de la guerre du Droit. En sollicitant son concours, le gouvernement anglais avait fait miroiter à ses yeux de grandes espérances. Ce Home Rule, tant désiré, était présenté comme un des enjeux de la guerre. En août 1917, l’intelligent secrétaire d’État pour l’Inde, E. S. Montagu, promit à l’Inde un gouvernement responsable ; une consultation de l’Inde eut lieu, et en juillet 1918, le vice-roi, lord Chelmsford, signait avec Montagu un rapport officiel sur la réforme constitutionnelle. Le danger était grand pour les armées alliées, en ces premiers mois de 1918. Lloyd George avait, le 2 avril, adressé un Appel au peuple de l’Inde ; et la Conférence de guerre, réunie à Delhi à la fin du même mois, laissa entendre que l’indépendance de l’Inde était proche. Aussi, l’Inde répondit-elle en masse, et Gandhi, une fois de plus, prêta à l’Angleterre l’aide de s
U||a loyauté. L’Inde fournit 985.000 hommes ; elle fit d’immenses sacrifices. Et elle attendit, confiante, le prix de sa fidélité.
U||Le réveil fut terrible. Vers la fin de l’année, le danger était passé ; passée aussi la mémoire des services rendus. L’armistice conclu, le Gouvernement ne se donna plus la peine de feindre. Bien loin d’accorder des libertés à l’Inde, il suspendit celles qui existaient. Les Bills Rowlatt, présentés au Conseil Impérial Législatif de Delhi, en février 1919, témoignèrent d’une injurieuse méfiance pour le pays qui venait de donner tant de gages de son loyalisme ; ils perpétuaient les dispositions de l’Acte de Défense de l’Inde pendant la guerre, rétablissant la police secrète, la censure, toutes les tracasseries tyranniques d’un véritable état de siège.
U||Ce fut, dans l’Inde déçue, un sursaut indigné. La révolte commença[24]. Gandhi l’organisa.
U||[24] On peut dater du 28 février 1919 les débuts du mouvement Satyâgraha.
U||Il s’était cantonné, pendant les années précédentes, dans les réformes sociales, s’occupant surtout d’améliorer la condition des travailleurs agricoles. Et, sans qu’on y eût pris garde, il avait fait, dans les troubles agraires de 1918, à Kaira dans le Gujerat, à Champaran dans le Behar, l’essai victorieux de l’arme formidable qu’il allait bientôt employer aux luttes nationales : cette Non-résistance passionnée, qui lui est propre, et que nous étudierons plus loin, sous le nom qu’il lui a donné de Satyâgraha.
U||Mais il était resté jusqu’en 1919 au second rang, et un peu à l’écart du mouvement national indien, dont les éléments avancés, réunis en 1916 par Mrs Annie Besant (bientôt dépassée), reconnaissaient maintenant pour chef le grand hindou Lokamanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Homme d’une rare énergie, unissant en un faisceau de fer la triple grandeur de l’intelligence, de la volonté et du caractère, un plus vaste cerveau que Gandhi, plus solidement nourri de la vieille culture asiatique, savant, mathématicien, érudit, ayant sacrifié toutes les exigences de son génie au service de sa patrie, et, dénué comme Gandhi de toute ambition personnelle, n’attendant que la victoire de sa cause pour se retirer de la scène et reprendre son labeur scientifique. Il fut, tant qu’il vécut, le chef incontesté de l’Inde. Que se serait-il passé, si une mort prématurée ne l’eût enlevé, en août 1920 ? Gandhi, qui s’inclinait devant la souveraineté de son génie, différait profondément de 
U||lui sur la méthode politique, et, sans doute, n’eût-il gardé, Tilak vivant, que la direction en quelque sorte religieuse du mouvement. Quel eût été l’élan des peuples de l’Inde, sous ce double commandement ! Rien n’aurait pu lui résister, car Tilak possédait la maîtrise de l’action, comme Gandhi des forces intérieures. Le sort en a décidé autrement : on a pu le regretter, pour l’Inde, et pour Gandhi lui-même. Le rôle de chef de la minorité, de l’élite morale, eût mieux répondu à sa nature et à ses secrets désirs. Il eût laissé volontiers à Tilak la direction de la majorité. Il n’a jamais eu la foi en la majorité. Cette foi, Tilak la possédait. Ce mathématicien d’action croyait au nombre. Il était démocrate-né. Il était, aussi, résolument politique, sans égards aux exigences de la religion. Il disait que « la politique n’était pas pour les Sâdhus » (les saints, les hommes pieux). Ce savant eût sacrifié, déclarait-il, même la vérité à la l
U||iberté de son pays. Et cet homme intègre, dont la vie fut d’une pureté sans tache, n’hésitait pas à dire que tout était juste en politique. On peut croire qu’entre une telle personnalité et celle des dictateurs de Moscou des rapports de pensée eussent été possibles. Mais la pensée de Gandhi y est irréductible[25]. Les discussions entre Tilak et Gandhi n’ont fait, en affirmant leur profonde estime mutuelle, qu’établir l’opposition de leurs méthodes, — c’est-à-dire, en des hommes aussi absolument sincères, chez qui les formes de l’action sont calquées sur celles de la pensée, — l’opposition des impératifs qui dominent leur existence. En face de Tilak, Gandhi proclame qu’obligé au choix, il sacrifierait la liberté à la vérité. Et quelque amour religieux qu’il ait pour son pays, il met sa religion plus haut encore que le pays :
U||    « Je suis marié à l’Inde, je lui dois tout. Je crois qu’elle a une mission. Si elle y manque, ce sera pour moi l’heure de l’épreuve, et j’espère que moi, je ne faillirai pas. Ma religion n’a pas de limites géographiques. Si ma foi est vivante, elle dépassera mon amour pour l’Inde même… »[26]
U||[25] Il s’est prononcé nettement contre le Bolchevisme. (24 novembre 1921).
U||[26] 11 août 1920. Gandhi s’oppose ici à « la doctrine de l’Épée ».
U||Grandes paroles qui donnent tout leur sens humain à la lutte que nous allons décrire maintenant : car elles font de l’apôtre de l’Inde un apôtre du monde, notre concitoyen à tous[27]. Et c’est pour nous tous que se livre le combat, engagé il y a quatre ans par le Mahâtmâ.
U||[27] « L’humanité est une. Il y a des différences de races ; mais plus une race est haute, plus elle a de devoirs. » (Ethical Religion).
U||Il est à remarquer que, même à ce moment où il prend la tête du mouvement de révolte contre l’Acte Rowlatt, il le fait « pour détourner ce mouvement de la violence »[28]. Car, de toute façon, la révolte vient, et il faut la guider.
U||[28] 5 novembre 1919.
U||Pour bien comprendre ce qui va suivre, on doit se rappeler que la pensée de Gandhi est à deux étages : des substructions religieuses qui sont considérables, et l’action sociale qu’il construit sur ces bases invisibles, en l’adaptant aux possibilités actuelles et aux vœux du pays. Il est religieux par nature, politicien par nécessité. A mesure que la poussée des événements et la disparition des autres chefs de la nation l’obligent à assumer la charge de gouverner le navire dans la tempête, le caractère politique et pratique de son action s’affirme. Mais l’essentiel de l’édifice reste toujours la crypte : elle est vaste et profonde, et faite pour porter une bien autre cathédrale que celle qu’il faut bâtir hâtivement ; elle seule est durable, le reste est provisoire et destiné à l’usage des années de transition. Il importe donc de connaître cette église souterraine, où la pensée de Gandhi a ses solides assises. C’est là qu’il fait retraite, chaque jour, afin de 
U||reprendre des forces pour l’action d’en haut.
U||Gandhi croit avec ferveur en la religion de son peuple, l’Hindouisme ; mais non pas en savant, attaché aux textes ; et pas davantage en dévot sans critique, qui accepte aveuglément toute tradition. Sa religion a pour double contrôle sa conscience et sa raison.
U||    « Je ne ferais pas un fétiche de la religion, et je n’excuse pas n’importe quel mal, en son nom sacré…[29]. Je n’ai aucun désir d’entraîner un seul être avec moi, si je ne peux en appeler à sa raison. Je vais jusqu’à rejeter la divinité des plus antiques Shâstras, si elles ne convainquent pas ma raison… »[30].
U||[29] 27 octobre 1920.
U||[30] Juillet 1920. — « Ma croyance n’exige pas que je considère tous les versets comme divinement inspirés… Je me refuse à être lié par aucune interprétation, quelque savante qu’elle soit, si elle répugne à la raison et au sens moral… » (6 octobre 1921).
U||D’autre part, et ceci est essentiel, il ne reconnaît et ne permet à l’Hindouisme aucun exclusivisme :
U||    « Je ne crois pas à la divinité exclusive des Vedas. Je crois que la Bible, le Coran et le Zend-Avesta sont aussi divinement inspirés que les Vedas… L’Hindouisme n’est pas une religion missionnaire. Il y a place en lui pour l’adoration de tous les prophètes du monde… Il dit à chacun d’adorer Dieu selon sa propre foi ou Dharma ; et ainsi, il vit en paix avec toutes les religions. »[31]
U||[31] Ibid. — « Toutes les religions sont des routes diverses qui convergent vers le même but. » (Hind Swarâj). — « Toutes les religions sont fondées sur les mêmes lois morales. Ma religion éthique est faite des lois qui lient tous les hommes du monde. » (Ethical Religion).
U||Il n’est pas sans voir les erreurs ou les vices qui se sont introduits au cours des siècles, dans l’Hindouisme, et il les flétrit. Mais…
U||    « … Je ne puis pas plus décrire mon sentiment pour l’Hindouisme que celui que j’ai pour ma propre femme. Elle m’émeut comme nulle autre femme au monde ne le peut. Non point qu’elle soit sans fautes : j’ose dire qu’elle en a beaucoup plus que je n’en vois ; mais le sentiment d’un lien indissoluble est là. De même pour l’Hindouisme, avec tous ses défauts et toutes ses limitations. Rien ne me transporte autant que la musique de la Gitâ et du Râmâyana, les deux seuls livres de l’Hindouisme que je puisse prétendre connaître… Je sais les vices actuels qui souillent les grands sanctuaires hindous ; mais j’aime ceux-ci malgré tout… Réformateur jusqu’au bout, je ne rejette pourtant aucune des croyances essentielles de l’Hindouisme »[32].
U||[32] 6 octobre 1921.
U||Quelles sont donc ces essentielles vérités, auxquelles il donne son adhésion ? Il les énumère expressément dans un article du 6 octobre 1921, qui est son Credo public :
U||    « 1. Je crois aux Vedas, aux Upanishads, aux Puranas, et à tout ce qui est compris sous le nom d’Écritures hindoues, et par conséquent je crois aux Avatârs et aux renaissances ;
U||    « 2. Je crois aux Varnâshrama Dharma[33] (Discipline des Castes), mais au sens strictement védique, et non pas actuel, populaire et grossier ;
U||    « 3. Je crois à la protection de la vache, dans un sens beaucoup plus large que le sens populaire ;
U||    « 4. Je ne désavoue pas le culte des idoles. »
U||[33] Étymologiquement : Varna : couleur, classe ou caste ; ashrama : lien de discipline ; dharma : religion. La société est représentée comme une discipline de classes. C’est le fondement de l’Hindouisme.
U||Tout Européen qui s’arrêtera, dans sa lecture, à ces lignes du Credo jugera que la mentalité qui s’y exprime est si différente de la nôtre, si strictement enfermée dans un corps de doctrines religieuses et sociales, lointaines dans le temps, lointaines dans l’espace, sans mesure commune avec notre intelligence, qu’il est vain de poursuivre. Qu’il continue pourtant ! Il trouvera, quelques lignes plus bas, ceci qui lui sera plus familier :
U||    « Je crois à l’aphorisme hindou, que nul ne connaît vraiment les Shâstras, qui n’ait atteint la perfection dans l’Innocence (Ahimsâ), dans la Vérité (Satya), dans la maîtrise de soi (Brahmacharya), et qui n’ait pas renoncé à toute acquisition et possession de richesses. »
U||Ici, la parole de l’Hindou rejoint celle de l’Évangile. Et Gandhi avait conscience de cette parenté. Son Ethical Religion s’achève par une citation du Christ[34]. Un pasteur anglais le questionnant, en 1920, sur les livres dont il avait reçu la plus forte influence, il répondit d’abord : Le Nouveau Testament[35]. Bien plus, c’est de son propre aveu[36], au Sermon sur la Montagne, qu’il dut en 1893 la révélation de la Résistance Passive. Son interlocuteur lui demanda, surpris :
U||[34] « Cherchez le royaume de Dieu et la Justice, et le reste vous sera donné par surcroît. »
U||[35] Young India, 25 février 1920.
U||[36] A Joseph J. Doke, en 1908.
U||Il fut même très près de se faire chrétien, en Sud-Afrique. Mais la lecture des livres bouddhiques, en le satisfaisant plus pleinement, le retint dans l’hindouisme.
U||«  — Ne l’aviez-vous pas eue avant, par la lecture des livres hindous ?
U||— Non, insiste Gandhi. Je connaissais et j’admirais, avant, la Bhagavad Gîtâ. Mais ce fut le Nouveau Testament qui m’éveilla à la valeur de la Résistance Passive. Je débordais de joie, en le lisant. La Bhagavad Gîtâ fortifia cette impression ; et Le Royaume de Dieu est en vous, de Tolstoy, lui donna une forme durable. »[37]
U||[37] Il dit encore à Joseph J. Doke :
U||« Dieu s’est incarné, sous des formes diverses, à travers les âges. Dans la Gîtâ, Krishna dit : Quand la religion tombe ne décadence, quand l’irréligion prévaut, alors je me manifeste. Pour la protection du bien, pour la destruction du mal, pour le ferme établissement du Dharma, je renais encore et toujours.
U||« Le Christianisme fait partie de ma théologie. Le Christ est une resplendissante révélation de Dieu. Mais non la révélation unique. Je ne le vois pas sur un trône solitaire… »
U||Il ne faut pas oublier, en effet, que ce croyant asiatique est nourri de Tolstoy[38], qu’il a traduit Ruskin[39] et Platon[40], qu’il s’appuie sur Thoreau, admire Mazzini, lit Edward Carpenter, et que sa pensée est imprégnée de celles d’Europe et d’Amérique. Il n’y a point de raison pour qu’un Européen se trouve davantage étranger à la sienne, s’il veut prendre la peine de s’en approcher. Alors, il reconnaîtra le sens profond de ces articles du Credo, dont la lettre l’étonne. Deux surtout paraissent établir une barrière infranchissable entre l’esprit religieux de l’Inde et celui de l’Europe : le culte de la vache, et le système des castes[41]. Mais voyons ce qu’ils signifient, au regard de Gandhi :
U||[38] La brochure de l’Hind Swarâj contient, à la fin, une liste dressée par Gandhi de six ouvrages de Tolstoy, qu’il conseille de lire (notamment : Le Royaume de Dieu est en vous, Qu’est-ce que l’Art ? Que faire ?) — Il parle à Joseph J. Doke de la profonde influence que Tolstoy exerça sur lui. Mats il ajoute qu’il ne l’a pas suivi dans ses idées politiques. — A une question qui lui est posée, en 1921 : « Dans quels rapports êtes-vous avec le comte Tolstoy ? » Gandhi répond dans Young India (25 octobre 1921) : « Ceux d’un admirateur dévot, qui lui doit beaucoup dans la vie. »
U||[39] Il aimait surtout de Ruskin le livre : Crown of Wild Olive (La Couronne d’olivier sauvage).
U||[40] L’Apologie et la Mort de Socrate, traduite par Gandhi, fut parmi les livres prohibés par le gouvernement de l’Inde, en 1919.
U||[41] Il n’y a pas lieu de s’arrêter au culte des idoles. « Je n’ai pas de vénération pour elles, écrit Gandhi. Mais cela fait partie de la nature humaine. » Il le considère comme un besoin respectable, inhérent à l’infirmité de l’esprit humain, qui a parfois besoin de matérialiser sa croyance, pour mieux l’adorer. Ce n’est donc rien de plus que ce que nous voyons dans toutes nos églises catholiques.
U||Certes, ce ne sont pas pour lui des articles secondaires, dans l’ensemble de la doctrine. La protection de la vache est la caractéristique de l’Hindouisme. Gandhi y voit même une des affirmations les plus hautes de l’évolution humaine. Pourquoi ? Parce qu’elle est un symbole de « tout le monde subhumain », avec lequel l’homme conclut un pacte d’alliance. Elle signifie « la fraternité entre l’homme et la bête ». Et, selon sa belle expression, « elle emporte l’être humain au-delà des limites de son espèce. Elle réalise l’identité de l’homme avec tout ce qui vit ». Si la vache a été choisie, de préférence aux autres êtres, c’est qu’elle est dans l’Inde le meilleur compagnon, la source d’abondance ; et Gandhi voit en « ce doux animal un poème de pitié. » Mais le culte qu’il lui rend n’a rien d’idolâtrique, et nul ne condamne plus durement le fétichisme sans bonté du peuple de l’Inde, qui n’observe que la lettre sans pratiquer l
U||’esprit de compassion « pour les muettes créatures de Dieu ». Une fois qu’on l’a compris — (et qui l’eût mieux compris que le poverello d’Assise !) — on ne peut s’étonner de l’importance qu’y attache Gandhi. Il n’a point tort de dire que la protection de la vache, au sens qu’il lui attribue, « est le don de l’Hindouisme au monde ». Car, au précepte de l’Évangile : Aime ton prochain comme toi-même, il ajoute : Tout ce qui vit est ton prochain.[42]
U||[42] Sur le culte de la vache, voir dans Young India les articles des 16 mars, 8 juin, 29 juin, 4 août 1920, 18 mai, 6 octobre 1921. — Sur les castes. 8 décembre 1920, 6 octobre 1921.
U||Le système des castes est peut-être plus difficile encore à accepter pour une intelligence d’Europe — (tout au moins, de l’Europe d’aujourd’hui : car Dieu sait ce que nous réserve l’avenir d’une évolution qui n’est plus démocratique que de nom !) — Je ne me flatte point de réussir, par l’exposé des explications de Gandhi, à le faire accepter, et je ne le désire point. Mais elles établiront nettement qu’aucune pensée d’orgueil et de suprématie sociale n’inspire cette croyance, mais une pensée de devoir dans le rang qui est assigné à chacun.
U||    « Je suis porté à croire, dit Gandhi, que la loi de l’hérédité est éternelle et que toute tentative pour la changer conduit à l’absolue confusion… Le Varnâshrama est inhérent à la nature humaine, et l’Hindouisme l’a simplement réduit en science… »
U||Mais il limite les classes à quatre seulement : Brahmanes (classe intellectuelle et spirituelle), Kshattriyas (militaire et gouvernementale), Vaishyas (commerciale), et Shudras (travail et service manuels). Et il n’admet entre elles aucune relation de supériorité ou d’infériorité. Ce sont des vocations différentes : rien de plus. Des devoirs. Point de privilèges[43].
U||[43] Quand au cours des âges, les classes primitives ne pétrifièrent en castes orgueilleuses, les Upanishads élevèrent leur protestation.
U||    « Il est contre le génie de l’Hindouisme qu’un homme s’assigne un plus haut rang, ou assigne à d’autres un plus bas. Tous sont nés pour servir la création de Dieu, le Brahmane par son savoir, le Kshattriya par sa force protectrice, le Vaishya par son habileté commerciale, le Shudra par son travail corporel. Cela ne veut pas dire qu’un Brahmane soit dispensé du travail corporel, mais qu’il est mieux fait pour le savoir, ni qu’un Shudra ne puisse acquérir tout le savoir, mais qu’il servira mieux avec son corps, et qu’il n’a pas besoin d’envier les fonctions des autres. Un Brahmane qui prétendrait à la supériorité, à cause de son savoir, serait, de ce fait, déchu de son rang, et n’a pas de vrai savoir… Le Varnâshrama a pour raison d’être l’économie de l’énergie sociale (sa bonne distribution) et la saine contrainte exercée sur soi par la volonté… »
U||Il est donc basé sur l’« abnégation », et non sur le privilège. N’oublions pas, d’ailleurs, que, dans la croyance à la transmigration, la nature rétablit l’équilibre, au cours des existences successives, en faisant d’un Brahmane un Shudra, et vice versa.
U||La question des parias n’a aucun rapport avec celle des quatre castes différentes, mais égales. Nous verrons avec quelle passion brûlante Gandhi ne cesse de combattre cette iniquité sociale : et c’est un des côtés les plus émouvants de son apostolat. Elle est pour lui la honte de l’Hindouisme, une déformation abjecte de la vraie doctrine, une souillure, et il en souffre d’une façon intolérable :
U||    « J’aimerais mieux être mis en pièces, écrit-il, que de ne pas reconnaître mes frères des classes refoulées… Je ne désire pas renaître ; mais si je renais, je désire renaître parmi les intouchables, afin de partager leurs affronts et de travailler à leur libération… »[44]
U||[44] 27 avril 1921.
U||Il adopta une petite intouchable, et il parle avec tendresse de ce charmant diablotin de sept ans, qui faisait dans sa maison la pluie et le beau temps.
U||J’en ai dit assez pour montrer, sous le vêtement du Credo hindou, le grand cœur évangélique. Un Tolstoy plus tendre, plus apaisé, et, si j’ose dire, plus naturellement « chrétien », au sens universel : car Tolstoy l’est bien moins par nature que par volonté.
U||Où la ressemblance des deux hommes s’accuse, où peut-être l’influence de Tolstoy a été la plus réelle, c’est dans la condamnation portée par Gandhi contre la civilisation d’Europe.
U||Depuis Rousseau, le procès de la civilisation n’a cessé d’être fait par les esprits les plus libres d’Europe, et l’Asie réveillée n’avait qu’à puiser dans leurs cahiers de doléances, pour constituer un dossier formidable contre ses envahisseurs. Gandhi n’y a pas manqué, et l’Hind Swarâj énumère une liste de ces livres accusateurs, parmi lesquels bon nombre sont écrits par des Anglais. Mais le livre sans réplique, c’est celui que la civilisation d’Europe a écrit elle-même dans le sang des races opprimées, dépouillées et souillées, au nom de principes menteurs ; et ç’a été surtout la révélation éclatante de ce mensonge, de cette avidité, de cette férocité, impudiquement étalés aux yeux du monde par la dernière guerre, dite de la Civilisation. Telle fut l’inconscience de l’Europe qu’elle y convia les peuples d’Asie et d’Afrique, pour voir sa nudité. Ils l’ont vue et jugée.
U||    « La dernière guerre a montré la nature satanique[45] de la civilisation qui domine l’Europe d’aujourd’hui. Toutes les lois de moralité publique ont été brisées par les vainqueurs, au nom de la vertu. Nul mensonge n’a été regardé trop ignoble pour être utilisé. Derrière tous les crimes, le motif est grossièrement matériel… L’Europe n’est pas chrétienne. Elle adore Mammon… »[46]
U||[45] C’est un terme qui revient souvent, sous la plume de Gandhi : « L’intouchabilité (la croyance aux parias) est une invention de Satan ». (10 Juin 1921).
U||[46] 8 septembre 1920.
U||Vous trouverez de telles pensées vingt fois exprimées depuis cinq ans, aux Indes et au Japon. Même chez ceux qui sont trop prudents pour les énoncer tout haut, cette conviction est inscrite maintenant à l’intérieur du front. Ce n’est pas le moins ruineux résultat de la victoire à la Pyrrhus de 1918. Mais Gandhi n’avait pas attendu 1914 pour voir le vrai visage de la civilisation : elle s’était montrée à lui, sans masque, durant les vingt années au Sud-Afrique. Et, dans son Hind Swarâj de 1908, il dénonçait, comme « le grand vice », la « Civilisation moderne ».
U||La Civilisation, dit Gandhi, l’est seulement de nom. Elle est, selon une expression de l’Hindouisme, « l’âge noir, l’âge des ténèbres ». Elle fait du bien matériel le but unique de la vie. Elle ne s’occupe point des biens de l’âme. Elle affole les Européens, elle les asservit à l’argent, elle les rend incapables de paix et même de vie intérieure ; elle est un enfer pour les faibles et pour les classes travailleuses ; elle mine la vitalité des races. Cette civilisation satanique se détruira elle-même. Le vrai ennemi de l’Inde, c’est elle, bien plus que les Anglais qui, individuellement, ne sont pas méchants, mais malades de leur civilisation. Aussi, Gandhi combat ceux de ses compatriotes qui voudraient chasser les Anglais, pour faire de l’Inde un État « civilisé », à la façon européenne. Ce serait, dit-il, « la nature du tigre, sans le tigre. » Non, le grand, « le seul effort requis est de chasser la civilisation d’Occident. »
U||Il est trois classes d’hommes contre qui Gandhi s’élève avec une âpreté particulière : les magistrats, les médecins et les professeurs.
U||L’exclusion de ces derniers est explicable, puisqu’ils ont désappris aux Indiens leur propre langue et leur propre pensée ; ils infligent à l’enfant une dégradation nationale. De plus, ils ne s’adressent qu’à l’intellect ; ils ignorent le cœur, ils négligent le caractère. Enfin, ils déprécient le travail manuel ; et c’est un véritable crime qu’une éducation uniquement littéraire, dans un peuple dont 80% sont agricoles, 10% industriels. — La profession de magistrat est immorale. Les tribunaux, dans l’Inde, sont un instrument du pouvoir britannique ; ils attisent les dissensions entre les Indiens ; et, d’une façon générale, ils entretiennent et multiplient en tous pays les discussions et les querelles. C’est une exploitation, grassement lucrative, des mauvais instincts. — Quant aux docteurs, Gandhi convient qu’il fut attiré d’abord par leur profession ; mais bientôt il reconnut qu’elle n’était pas honorable. La médecine d’Occident s’occupe u
U||niquement de soulager le corps des malades, nullement d’extirper les causes des maladies, qui sont en grande partie les vices : on peut même dire qu’elle les cultive, en offrant aux vicieux les moyens d’en jouir, aux moindres risques. Elle contribue donc à démoraliser un peuple ; elle l’effémine, avec ses recettes de « magie noire »[47], qui le détournent d’une discipline héroïque du corps et de l’esprit. A cette fausse médecine d’Occident, que Gandhi a souvent flétrie, avec une violence qui dépasse la mesure, il oppose la vraie médecine préventive, à laquelle il a consacré Un de ses petits traités populaires : A Guide to Health (Le Guide de la Santé), fruit de vingt ans d’expérience. C’est un traité de morale autant que de thérapeutique : car « la maladie est le résultat, non seulement de nos actes, mais de nos pensées » ; et il est relativement simple de donner des règles pour prévenir le mal, « toutes les maladies ayant la même origine, qui est 
U||qu’on ne suit pas les lois naturelles de la santé. Le corps est la demeure de Dieu. Il faut le garder pur ». Il y a d’ailleurs dans les prescriptions de Gandhi (avec trop d’obstination à nier des remèdes éprouvés) beaucoup de bon sens, mais un extrême rigorisme moral[48].
U||[47] On ne doit pas oublier qu’un des principaux griefs de Gandhi contre la médecine d’Europe est qu’elle a recours à la vivisection, « ce crime le plus noir de l’homme ».
U||[48] Particulièrement en ce qui concerne les relations sexuelles : sa doctrine sévère rappelle Saint-Paul.
U||Mais le cœur de la civilisation moderne (âge de fer : cœur de fer), c’est la Machine. Elle est l’Idole monstrueuse. Il faut la rejeter. Le vœu ardent de Gandhi serait que le machinisme moderne fût arraché de l’Inde. A l’Inde libre, mais héritière du machinisme anglais, il préférerait encore l’asservissement de l’Inde au marché anglais.
U||    « Mieux vaut encore acheter le tissu de Manchester qu’installer dans l’Inde les fabriques de Manchester. Un Rockfeller indien ne vaudrait pas mieux que l’autre. Le machinisme est un grand péché, il asservit les peuples… Et l’Argent est un poison, comme le vice sexuel… »
U||Mais, demandent les Indiens conquis par les idées modernes, que deviendra l’Inde sans les chemins de fer, les trams, les grandes industries ? — N’était-elle pas, avant ? réplique Gandhi. « Depuis des milliers d’années, l’Inde demeure, inébranlable, seule, au milieu du flot changeant des Empires. Tout le reste a passé. Elle a su conquérir, depuis des milliers d’années, la maîtrise de soi et la science du bonheur. Elle n’a en cela rien à apprendre des autres. Elle n’a pas voulu du machinisme et des grandes cités. L’antique charrue, le rouet, l’ancienne éducation indigène, ont assuré sa sagesse et son bien. Il nous faut revenir à la simplicité antique, non d’un seul coup, sans doute, mais peu à peu, patiemment, chacun donnant l’exemple…[49]
U||[49] Hind Swarâj, passim.
U||Ceci est le fond de la pensée ; et c’est grave. Elle suppose la négation du Progrès, et presque de la science d’Europe[50]. Cette foi médiévale risque donc de se heurter à la poussée volcanique de l’esprit humain et d’être mise en pièces. Mais d’abord, il serait peut-être prudent de dire, non pas : « de l’esprit humain », mais : « d’un esprit humain » : car si l’on peut croire — (et je crois) — à l’unité symphonique de l’esprit universel, elle est faite de bien des voix diverses, qui suivent chacune sa partie ; et notre jeune Occident, emporté par son rythme, ne songe pas assez qu’il n’a pas toujours mené la symphonie, que sa loi du progrès est sujette à éclipses, à mouvements contraires et à recommencements, que l’histoire de la civilisation humaine est, plus exactement, l’histoire des civilisations, et que si, dans chaque civilisation, on constate un progrès (variable, chaotique, brisé, parfois arrêté), on ne saurait du tout assurer qu
U||il y ait eu progrès d’une des grandes civilisations à une autre.
U||[50] Gandhi tâche de sauvegarder, à défaut de la science européenne, la nécessité des recherches scientifiques et leur stricte discipline. Il admire le zèle et le sacrifice des hommes de science européens, qu’il trouve souvent supérieurs à ceux des hommes de foi hindous. Il respecte l’esprit ; il conteste seulement le chemin que cet esprit a choisi. — Mais en dépit de ces réserves, l’antagonisme est évident. Et là-dessus Tagore, comme nous le verrons, élève une juste protestation contre le médiévalisme de Gandhi.
U||Mais, sans discuter ici le dogme européen du Progrès, et en se tenant simplement au fait que tout le mouvement actuel va contre le vœu profond de Gandhi, il ne faut pas croire que la foi de Gandhi va s’y briser. Ce serait mal connaître l’esprit oriental. Gobineau dit que « les Asiatiques sont en toutes choses beaucoup plus obstinés que nous. Ils attendent des siècles, quand il le faut, et leur idée, après un aussi long sommeil, ne se trouve jamais avoir vieilli ni perdu de ses forces ». Les siècles ne sont pas pour effrayer un Hindou. Gandhi est prêt au succès, dans le cours de l’année. Mais il y est aussi prêt, dans le cours de quelques siècles. Il ne violente pas le temps. Et si le temps s’attarde, il s’attarde avec lui. Si donc, dans son action, il trouve l’Inde insuffisamment préparée à comprendre et à pratiquer les réformes radicales qu’il voudrait lui imposer, il saura adapter son action aux possibilités. Et l’on ne s’étonnera pas d’entendre cet irréconci
U||liable ennemi du machinisme dire, en 1921 :
U||    « Je ne pleurerais pas la disparition des machines ; mais je n’ai aucun dessein (actuellement) contre les machines… »[51]
U||[51] 19 janvier 1921.
U||Ou bien :
U||    « La loi de l’amour complet (sans exception ni restriction) est la loi de mon être. Mais je ne prêche pas cette loi finale par les mesures politiques que je préconise… Ce serait se condamner d’avance à l’échec. Attendre que la masse obéisse actuellement à cette loi ne serait pas raisonnable…[52]. Je ne suis pas un visionnaire, je prétends être un idéaliste pratique. »[53]
U||[52] 9 mars 1921.
U||[53] 11 août 1920.
U||La définition est exacte ; il ne demande jamais aux hommes que ce qu’ils peuvent donner. Mais il leur demande tout ce qu’ils peuvent donner. Et ce tout est beaucoup, quand il s’agit d’un peuple comme celui de l’Inde. Peuple formidable, par son nombre[54], sa durée, et son âme abyssale. Entre ce peuple et Gandhi, dès les premiers contacts, il s’est fait un accord, ils se comprennent sans parler ; Gandhi sait ce qu’il en peut attendre, et ce peuple attend ce que Gandhi va lui demander.
U||[54] Le cinquième de la population du globe.
U||Entre les deux, d’abord, cette convention formelle : le Swarâj[55], le Home Rule de l’Inde.
U||[55] Étymologie : Swa : « Self », soi-même ; Râj : gouvernement. Autonomie. Le mot est aussi vieux que les Vedas ; mais il fut redécouvert et introduit dans le vocabulaire politique par Dadabhai, le maître Parsi de Gandhi.
U||    « Je sais, écrit Gandhi, que le Swarâj est le but de la nation, et non la Non-violence… »
U||Et il va jusqu’à ajouter cette parole, stupéfiante dans sa bouche :
U||    « J’aimerais mieux voir l’Inde libre par la violence qu’esclave enchaînée à la violence des dominateurs. »
U||Mais, rectifie-t-il aussitôt, c’est supposer l’impossible : car la violence ne peut délivrer l’Inde ; le Swarâj ne peut être atteint sans les forces de l’âme, qui sont l’arme propre de l’Inde, l’arme d’amour, la force de vérité, — le Satyâgraha[56]. Et le coup de génie de Gandhi a été, en les prêchant à son peuple, de lui révéler sa vraie nature et sa puissance cachée.
U||[56] Étymologiquement : Satya : juste, droit ; Agraha : essai, tentative ; essai juste. On l’appliqua spécialement à la Non-acceptation de l’injustice. Gandhi le définit (5 novembre 1919) par : « Se tenir à la vérité ; force de vérité ; force d’amour, ou force d’âme » ; et enfin, « triomphe de la vérité par la force d’âme et d’amour ».
U||Le terme de Satyâgraha avait été inventé par Gandhi, en Sud-Afrique, pour distinguer son action de la résistance passive. Il faut insister avec la plus grande force sur cette distinction : car c’est précisément par la « résistance passive » (ou par la « non-résistance ») que les Européens définissent le mouvement de Gandhi. Rien n’est plus faux. Nul homme au monde n’a plus d’aversion pour la passivité que ce lutteur inlassable, qui est un des types les plus héroïques du « Résistant ». L’âme de son mouvement est Résistance active, par l’énergie enflammée de l’amour, de la foi et du sacrifice. Et cette triple énergie s’exprime dans le mot de Satyâgraha.
U||Que le couard ne vienne donc pas abriter sa poltronnerie, à l’ombre d’un Gandhi ! Gandhi le chasse de sa communauté. Mieux vaut encore le violent que le lâche !
U||    « Là où il n’y a le choix qu’entre lâcheté et violence, je conseillerai violence…[57]. Je cultive le courage tranquille de mourir sans tuer. Mais qui n’a pas ce courage, je désire qu’il cultive l’art de tuer et d’être tué, plutôt que de fuir honteusement le danger. Car celui qui fuit commet une violence mentale : il fuit, parce qu’il n’a pas le courage d’être tué en tuant…[58]. Je risquerais mille fois la violence, plutôt que l’émasculation de toute une race…[59]. Je préférerais de beaucoup voir l’Inde recourir aux armes pour défendre son honneur, plutôt que de rester lâchement témoin de son propre déshonneur… »[60]

U||[59] 4 août 1920.
U||[60] 11 août 1920. Une des Observances de l’École Satyâgraha Ashram, fondée par Gandhi, est l’absence de peur, l’âme libérée de la crainte des rois, des peuples, des castes, des familles, des hommes et des bêtes sauvages, de la mort ».
U||C’est aussi la quatrième condition de la Résistance non-violente dans l’Hind Swarâj. (Les trois autres sont la Chasteté, la Pauvreté, la Vérité).
U||    « Mais, ajoute-t-il, je sais que la Non-violence est infiniment supérieure à la violence, que le pardon est plus viril que le châtiment. Le pardon est la parure du soldat. Mais s’abstenir de punir n’est pardon que quand existe le pouvoir de punir. Il n’a aucun sens, de la part d’une créature impuissante… Je ne crois pas l’Inde impuissante. Cent mille Anglais ne peuvent effrayer trois cent millions d’êtres humains… Et d’ailleurs, la force n’est pas dans les moyens physiques, elle réside dans une volonté indomptable… Non-violence n’est pas soumission bénévole au malfaisant. Non-violence oppose toute la force de l’âme à la volonté du tyran. Un seul homme peut ainsi défier un empire et provoquer sa chute… »
U||Mais à quel prix ? Sa souffrance. Souffrance, la grande loi…
U||    « L’insigne de la tribu humaine…[61]. La condition indispensable de l’être. La vie sort de la mort. Pour que le blé pousse, il faut que la semence périsse. Nul ne s’est jamais élevé sans avoir passé par le feu de la souffrance… Nul ne peut y échapper… Le progrès ne consiste qu’à purifier la souffrance, en évitant de faire souffrir… Plus pure est la souffrance (personnelle), plus grand le progrès…[62]. Non-violence est souffrance consciente… Je me suis permis de présenter à l’Inde l’antique loi du sacrifice de soi, la loi de Souffrance. Les Rishis qui découvrirent la loi de Non-violence, au milieu des pires violences, étaient de plus grands génies que Newton, de plus grands guerriers que Wellington : ils ont réalisé l’inutilité des armes, qu’ils avaient connues… La religion de la Non-violence n’est pas seulement pour les saints, elle est pour le commun des hommes. C’est la loi de notre espèce, comme la violence est la loi de la brute. L’esprit dor
U||t dans la brute. La dignité de l’homme veut une loi plus haute : la force de l’esprit… Je veux que l’Inde pratique cette loi, je veux qu’elle ait conscience de son pouvoir. Elle a une âme qui ne peut pas périr. Cette âme peut défier toutes les forces matérielles du monde entier[63]. »

U||[63] 11 août 1920.
U||Haut orgueil. Son amour fier de l’Inde veut qu’elle répudie l’indigne violence, et qu’elle se sacrifie. La Non-violence est son titre de noblesse. Si elle y renonce, elle est déchue. Et Gandhi n’en pourrait supporter la pensée :
U||    « Si l’Inde faisait de la violence sa foi, je ne tiendrais plus à vivre dans l’Inde ; elle cesserait de m’inspirer aucune fierté. Mon patriotisme est subordonné à ma religion, je me cramponne à l’Inde, comme un enfant au sein maternel, parce que je sens qu’elle me donne la nourriture spirituelle dont j’ai besoin. Quand cette nourriture manquera, je serai comme un orphelin… Je me retirerai dans les solitudes de l’Himalaya, pour y abriter mon âme en sang… »[64]
U||[64] 6 avril 1921.
U||Mais il ne doute point ; il croit en l’Inde, lorsqu’en février 1919 il décide d’ouvrir sa campagne de Satyâgraha, cette arme dont il avait expérimenté la puissance dans les Mouvements agraires de 1918.
U||Nulle couleur de révolte politique. Gandhi est encore loyaliste. Il le restera, tant qu’il conservera une lueur d’espoir en la loyauté de l’Angleterre. Jusqu’en janvier 1920, il défendra — et les nationalistes indiens le lui reprocheront amèrement[65] — le principe de coopération avec l’Empire. Il y porte la conviction de son honnêteté. En cette première année d’opposition au gouvernement de l’Inde, il pourra affirmer en toute sincérité à lord Hunter qu’il voit dans les adeptes au Satyâgraha les meilleurs sujets constitutionnels du gouvernement. Il faudra l’entêtement borné du gouvernement de l’Inde pour forcer le guide moral de l’Inde à déchirer le contrat de loyalisme, auquel il se croyait lié.
U||[65] Quelques mois encore avant son emprisonnement, Gandhi répond aux vifs reproches qui lui sont adressés sur « l’illogisme » de sa politique. On rappelle avec dérision le secours qu’il a apporté à l’Angleterre, dans le Sud-Afrique, et pendant la guerre mondiale. A ce moment encore, il ne renie rien de sa conduite passée. Il croyait honnêtement, dit-il, qu’il était citoyen de l’Empire ; son affaire n’était pas de juger le gouvernement ; il trouverait fâcheux que chacun se constituât le juge de son gouvernement. Il a fait crédit à l’intelligence et à l’honnêteté anglaise, aussi longtemps qu’il l’a pu. L’aberration du gouvernement lui a arraché sa confiance. Que le gouvernement en porte la responsabilité ! (17 novembre 1921).
U||Ainsi, le Satyâgraha se présente au début comme une opposition constitutionnelle, une sommation respectueuse au gouvernement. Le gouvernement a édicté une loi injuste. Les « Satyâgrahi », qui, en temps ordinaire, s’inclinent devant les lois, désobéissent délibérément à la loi déshonorante ; et si cela ne suffit point pour rétablir la justice, ils se réservent la faculté d’étendre leur désobéissance à d’autres lois, jusqu’à retirer leur coopération complète à l’État. Mais que le caractère de cette désobéissance est différent de tout ce qu’on entend par ce mot, en Occident ! Quel extraordinaire accent d’héroïsme religieux !
U||Comme il est interdit aux Satyâgrahi d’agir sur l’adversaire par la violence — car on doit admettre que l’adversaire est, lui aussi, sincère : ce qui paraît vérité à l’un, à l’autre peut paraître erreur ; et la violence ne convainc jamais[66], — il faut qu’ils convainquent l’adversaire par le rayonnement d’amour qui émane de leur conviction, par leur abnégation, par leurs souffrances librement, joyeusement acceptées[67]. Propagande irrésistible. Par elle, la croix du Christ et son petit troupeau a conquis l’Empire.
U||[66] Elle fait pis. Elle dégrade celui qui l’emploie. Les violences des Alliés contre l’Allemagne, dit Gandhi, ont eu pour effet de rendre les Alliés pareils aux Allemands, dont ils flétrissaient les actes, au début de la guerre (9 juin 1920).
U||[67] « Si dure que soit une nature, elle fondra au feu de l’amour. Si elle ne fond pas, c’est que le feu n’est pas assez fort. » (9 mars 1920). Les participants au Satyâgraha signent, en masse, l’engagement de refuser l’obéissance aux lois mauvaises que leur désignera le Comité du Satyâgraha, de suivre fidèlement la voie de vérité, et de s’abstenir de toute violence à la vie, à la personne et à la propriété.
U||Afin de mettre en lumière ce religieux élan d’un peuple qui s’offre au sacrifice pour les biens éternels : justice et liberté, le Mahâtmâ inaugura le mouvement[68], en fixant au 6 avril 1919 un jour de prières et de jeûne, un Hartal[69] de toute l’Inde en protestation contre l’Acte Rowlatt. Ce fut son premier acte.
U||[68] 23 mars 1919.
U||[69] Ce mot hindi signifie : « arrêt de travail en signe de protestation ou de deuil ».
U||Et cet acte toucha au plus profond de la conscience de son peuple. Il eut un effet inouï. Pour la première fois, toutes les classes s’unirent en un même geste. L’Inde s’était retrouvée.
U||Le calme avait été à peu près général. A Delhi seulement, se produisirent quelques échauffourées[70]. Gandhi s’y rendit, pour éclairer le peuple sur ses devoirs. Mais le gouvernement le fit arrêter en chemin et reconduire à Bombay. Le bruit de l’arrestation souleva, en Punjab, des émeutes populaires. Il y eut à Amritsar des pillages et quelques meurtres. Le général Dyer arriva avec ses troupes, dans la nuit du 11 avril, et occupa la ville. Tout était rentré dans l’ordre. Le 13 était un jour de grande fête hindoue. La foule se rendit à une assemblée sur le lieu dit Jallianwalla Bagh. Elle était paisible et comptait beaucoup de femmes et d’enfants. Le général Dyer avait, dans la nuit précédente, prohibé tout meeting ; mais nul ne connaissait encore l’interdiction. Le général vint avec des mitrailleuses, à Jallianwalla Bagh. Aucune sommation ne fut faite. Trente secondes après l’arrivée des troupes, le feu fut ouvert sur la foule sans défense ; il dura dix minute
U||s, jusqu’à épuisement des munitions. Le terrain était entouré de hautes murailles ; la fuite était impossible. Cinq à six cents Hindous furent tués, un plus grand nombre blessés. On ne prit aucun souci des morts et des blessés. La loi martiale fut proclamée dans le pays. Un régime de terreur écrasa le Punjab. On vit des avions jeter des bombes sur des foules désarmées. Les plus honorables citoyens furent traînés devant les tribunaux militaires, fouettés, contraints à ramper sur le ventre, soumis à de honteuses humiliations… On eût dit qu’un vent de folie soufflât sur les dominateurs anglais. Comme si la loi de Non-violence, proclamée par l’Inde, eût eu pour premier effet d’exaspérer les violents d’Europe, jusqu’à la frénésie ! Gandhi ne l’ignorait point. Il n’avait pas promis à son peuple de le mener à la victoire, par une route blanche. Il lui avait promis la voie sanglante. Et le jour de Jallianwalla Bagh n’était que le jour du baptême…
U||[70] Delhi s’était d’ailleurs trompée de date ; elle avait fait son Hartal, dès le 30 mars.
U||    « Nous devons être prêts à envisager avec égalité d’âme, leur dit-il, non pas mille assassinats d’hommes et de femmes innocents, mais plusieurs milliers, avant que l’Inde atteigne dans le monde à un rang qui ne sera jamais surpassé… Que chacun regarde la pendaison comme une affaire ordinaire de la vie !…[71] »
U||[71] 7 avril 1920.
U||La censure militaire réussit à empêcher pendant quelques semaines que les horreurs du Punjab fussent connues au dehors[72]. Mais quand le bruit s’en répandit dans l’Inde, un flot d’indignation parcourut le pays ; et l’Angleterre même s’émut. Une enquête fut ouverte par une Commission, que présidait lord Hunter. Parallèlement, le Congrès National indien forma une sous-commission pour procéder à une contre-enquête. L’intérêt évident du Gouvernement — (tous les Anglais intelligents le comprirent) — eût été de sévir contre les fauteurs du massacre d’Amritsar. Gandhi n’en demandait même pas tant. En son admirable modération, il se refusait à réclamer le châtiment du général Dyer et des autres officiers coupables, tout en les flétrissant. Il ne voulait pas de vengeance. Il n’avait pas de rancune… « On n’a pas de rancune contre un fou. Mais il faut lui enlever les moyens de faire du mal… » Il exigeait donc seulement le rappel de Dyer. Mais quos vult pe
U||rdere… Avant les conclusions de enquête, le gouvernement de l’Inde se hâta de faire passer une loi d’indemnité (Indemnity Act) pour la protection des fonctionnaires ; les officiers criminels ne furent pas seulement maintenus, ils furent récompensés.
U||[72] De son côté, Gandhi suspendait son mouvement, le 18 avril 1919, pour calmer l’effervescence, au lieu de l’exploiter, comme l’eût fait tout autre révolutionnaire.
U||L’Inde était au milieu de cet ébranlement, lorsqu’une seconde affaire, beaucoup plus grave encore que la première, une violation flagrante d’engagements solennels pris par le chef du gouvernement anglais, acheva de ruiner le reste de confiance qu’elle pouvait avoir encore en la bonne foi des Européens et déclencha la grande Révolte.
U||La guerre d’Europe avait posé aux musulmans de l’Inde un rude problème de conscience. Ils se trouvaient partagés entre leur loyalisme envers l’Empire et leur fidélité au chef de leur religion. Ils ne s’étaient décidés pour l’Angleterre qu’après avoir reçu d’elle la promesse qu’elle n’attenterait pas à la souveraineté du Sultan ou Khalife. L’opinion musulmane exigeait que les Turcs conservassent la Turquie d’Europe, et que le Sultan gardât, avec le contrôle des Lieux Saints de l’Islam, la suzeraineté de l’Arabie telle qu’elle était définie par les savants musulmans, avec ses enclaves de la Mésopotamie, de la Syrie et de la Palestine. Lloyd George et le vice-roi de l’Inde avaient pris des engagements formels. La guerre terminée, de ces engagements il ne resta rien. Au cours de l’été 1919, les Musulmans de l’Inde, inquiets de la paix écrasante qui se brassait, commencèrent à gronder ; et ce fut le début de l’agitation du Khilafat (Kalifat).
U||Elle s’ouvrit, le 17 octobre 1919 (Khilafat Day), par une imposante démonstration pacifique, suivie, un mois après (24 novembre), par une Conférence du Khilafat de toute l’Inde, à Delhi. Gandhi la présidait. D’un œil prompt, il avait aussitôt saisi la question musulmane, comme l’instrument le plus propre à opérer l’unité indienne. C’était un gros problème. Les Anglais avaient toujours escompté l’inimitié naturelle entre Hindous et Musulmans ; et Gandhi les accuse même de l’avoir en grande partie créée. Ils n’avaient, en tout cas, rien fait pour la diminuer. Les deux religions se provoquaient puérilement l’une l’autre. Les Hindous ne manquaient pas de chanter en passant devant les mosquées, où le silence est de règle. Et les Musulmans avaient beau jeu à blesser les Hindous dans leur culte de la vache. Il s’en suivait des querelles et des combats continuels qui entretenaient l’animosité. Les deux peuples ne frayaient pas entre eux ; mariages et repas communs
U|| leur étaient interdits. Le gouvernement de l’Inde dormait sur la certitude de cette division éternelle. La voix de Gandhi, proclamant l’union, à la conférence du Khilafat, le réveilla en sursaut. Avec une générosité sincère — et d’autant plus habile — Gandhi déclara que les Hindous devaient ne faire qu’un avec les Mahométans, pour la cause musulmane.
U||    « Hindous, Parsis, chrétiens ou Juifs, dit-il, qui que nous soyons, si nous souhaitons de vivre en une seule nation, l’intérêt d’un seul doit être celui tous. La seule considération qui compte, c’est la justice de sa cause. »
U||Le sang des Mahométans s’était déjà mêlé à celui des Hindous sur le champ de massacre d’Amritsar. Maintenant, il fallait sceller l’alliance. Une alliance sans conditions. Les Musulmans étaient l’élément le plus hardi de la population de l’Inde. Ils furent les premiers à décider, dans cette Conférence du Khilafat, le refus de coopération avec le gouvernement, s’ils n’obtenaient pas satisfaction. Gandhi les approuva. Toutefois, fidèle à son esprit de modération, il se refusa au boycott des marchandises anglaises, parce qu’il y voyait à la fois une vengeance et une marque de faiblesse. Une seconde conférence du Khilafat, à Amritsar, vers la fin de décembre 1919, résolut d’envoyer une députation en Europe, et fit porter au vice-roi un ultimatum menaçant pour le cas où la paix serait contraire aux volontés de l’Inde. Une troisième Conférence à Bombay, en février 1920, lança un manifeste musulman, qui flétrissait la politique anglaise et annonçait l’orage.
U||Gandhi le voyait venir ; et, bien loin de l’appeler, il faisait tout pour le retenir.
U||En Angleterre, il semblait qu’enfin on comprît le danger. Par de tardives concessions, on tâchait de l’arrêter. Un Acte de Réforme Indienne, basé sur les rapports Montagu-Chelmsford, accordait au peuple de l’Inde plus de pouvoirs et de responsabilités dans le gouvernement central et les administrations provinciales. Le Roi, par une proclamation du 24 décembre 1919, y donna son assentiment, convia le peuple et les fonctionnaires indiens à y coopérer, et demanda au vice-roi d’amnistier les condamnés politiques. Gandhi, toujours sensible à la générosité, se montra touché, et, voyant dans ces démarches un engagement tacite pris par l’Angleterre de rendre justice à l’Inde, il conseilla d’accepter les réformes ; il les jugeait incomplètes, mais pensait qu’elles pouvaient être le point de départ de conquêtes légales plus étendues et qu’on devait franchement s’y rallier. Après de vifs débats, son avis prévalut, au Congrès National de toute l’Inde.
U||Mais ce dernier espoir fut déjoué, comme les autres. Le vice-roi ne tint pas compte de l’appel fait à sa clémence ; si les prisons s’ouvrirent pour un grand nombre de condamnés politiques, l’amnistie ne fut pas générale, et il y eut des exécutions, qui surexcitèrent l’Inde. Il devint évident que les promesses de réformes resteraient un leurre.
U||A ce moment (14 mai 1920), l’Inde apprit les conditions de la paix désastreuse pour la Turquie. Un message du vice-roi reconnaissait qu’elles devaient être pénibles aux cœurs musulmans, mais les engageait à la résignation.
U||Enfin, en ces mêmes jours, tardivement publié, le rapport officiel de la Commission d’enquête sur les massacres d’Amritsar achevait de soulever la conscience du pays.
U||C’en fut fait. Les liens étaient rompus.
U||Le Comité Khilafat, réuni à Bombay, le 28 mai 1920, adopta la Non-coopération, proposée par Gandhi ; et la Conférence hindoue-musulmane d’Allahabad la vota à l’unanimité, le 30 juin 1920 : elle fixait au vice-roi un délai d’un mois pour faire droit à l’ultimatum.
U||Gandhi écrit lui-même au vice-roi. Il lui notifie le mouvement de Non-coopération. Il explique pourquoi il y a recours ; et les raisons qu’il en donne sont curieuses : car, même à ce suprême instant, il atteste son désir de ne pas rompre avec l’Angleterre, et son espoir de l’amener à résipiscence par une révolte légale :
U||    « Il ne me reste plus, dit-il, que deux seuls partis : ou bien me détacher de l’Angleterre, ou bien, si je crois encore à la supériorité de la Constitution britannique sur les autres Constitutions, obliger le gouvernement à nous rendre justice. Or, je crois encore à la supériorité de la Constitution britannique. Et c’est pourquoi je conseille la désobéissance. »
U||On voit quel grand citoyen de l’Empire l’aveugle orgueil de l’Empire n’a pas su conserver.
U||II
U||Le 28 juillet 1920, Gandhi annonce à l’Inde que la Non-coopération sera proclamée le 1er août ; et il prescrit, pour la veille, 31 juillet, un Hartal solennel de préparation par le jeûne et les prières. Il ne craint rien de la fureur du gouvernement. Davantage, il redoute la fureur populaire ; et il prend des dispositions pour que l’ordre et la discipline règnent dans les rangs indiens.
U||    « La Non-coopération complète veut une organisation complète. Le désordre vient de la colère. Il faut une absence totale de violence. Toute violence serait un recul pour la cause et un gaspillage inutile de vies innocentes. Avant tout, que l’ordre soit observé ! »
U||La tactique de la Non-coopération avait été établie, dans les deux mois précédents, par Gandhi et son comité de la N.-C. On avait décrété :
U||1o L’abandon de tous les titres et fonctions honorifiques ;
U||2o La non-participation aux emprunts du gouvernement ;
U||3o La grève des tribunaux et des hommes de loi ; l’arrangement des litiges par arbitrages privés ;
U||4o Le boycott des écoles du gouvernement par les étudiants et les familles ;
U||5o Le boycott des Conseils de Réformes constitutionnelles ;
U||6o La non-participation aux réceptions du gouvernement et à toutes fonctions officielles ;
U||7o Le refus de tout poste civil et militaire ;
U||8o La propagation du Swadeshi[73] : c’est-à-dire, après la partie négative du programme, la partie reconstructrice, l’ordre nouveau, sur lequel devait se fonder l’Inde nouvelle. Nous y reviendrons plus loin.
U||[73] Étymologiquement : Swa : Self, soi-même ; Deshi : Fait dans le pays, d’où : objets faits dans le pays. Les adeptes de la non-coopération le prennent surtout dans le sens restreint d’Indépendance économique. Mais nous verrons plus loin quel « Évangile social » en font sortir les disciples de Gandhi (The Gospel of Swadeshi).
U||Ce n’était encore qu’une première étape ; et l’on remarquera la prudente sagesse — bien étonnante pour des révolutionnaires européens — de cet homme qui met en branle l’énorme machine de la Révolte hindoue, et qui la retient suspendue, d’abord, au premier cran. Il ne s’agit pas ici de Désobéissance civile. Gandhi connaît celle-ci. Il l’a étudiée chez Thoreau, qu’il cite dans ses articles, et il a grand soin de la distinguer de la Non-coopération. La désobéissance civile est plus qu’un refus d’obéissance, elle est une violation des lois. « Elle est une infraction, qui ne peut être pratiquée avec succès que par une élite, au lieu que la Non-coopération peut et doit être un mouvement de masse. » Gandhi veut préparer le peuple de l’Inde à la Désobéissance, mais graduellement ; il le sait insuffisamment prêt et ne veut point lui lâcher la bride, avant d’être certain que le peuple a conquis sa possession de soi. Dans ce premier programme de Non-co
U||opération, il n’est même pas question du refus des impôts. Gandhi attend l’heure.
U||Le 1er août 1920, il donne le signal du mouvement, par une lettre fameuse au vice-roi. Il lui renvoie ses décorations et ses titres d’honneur.
U||« Ce n’est pas sans chagrin, dit-il, que je renvoie la médaille d’or Kaisar-i-Hind, pour ma tâche humanitaire dans le Sud-Afrique, la médaille de guerre Zoulou, pour mes services comme officier d’un corps d’ambulanciers volontaires hindous en 1906, la médaille de guerre Boer, pour mes services comme aide-surintendant du corps des brancardiers indiens en 1899-1900… » Mais, continue-t-il, après avoir rappelé les événements du Punjab et ceux qui ont motivé le mouvement Khilafat, « je ne puis conserver ni respect ni affection pour un gouvernement entaché de cette immoralité et de ces injustices… Il faut l’amener au repentir… J’ai suggéré la Non-coopération, qui permet de se dissocier du gouvernement et de le contraindre, sans violence. » Et Gandhi exprime l’espoir que le vice-roi réparera l’iniquité, en consultant les chefs reconnus du peuple.
U||L’exemple de Gandhi fut suivi sur-le-champ. De nombreux magistrats donnèrent leur démission. Des milliers d’étudiants furent retirés des collèges[74]. Les tribunaux perdirent leur prestige. Les écoles se vidèrent. Le Congrès de toute l’Inde, réuni en session spéciale, à Calcutta, avait dès le commencement de septembre, sanctionné les décisions de Gandhi, à une forte majorité. Gandhi et son ami Maulana Shaukat Ali parcoururent le pays, au milieu des acclamations.
U||[74] Huit mille, à Lahore.
U||Jamais Gandhi ne se révéla plus maître des millions d’hommes qu’en cette première année d’action. Il lui fallait brider la violence, qui ne demandait qu’à se ruer. Surtout, la violence anarchique de la populace lui faisait horreur. Il n’a pas d’expressions assez dures pour flétrir la « Mobocratie »[75], qui lui paraît le pire danger de l’Inde. Il déteste la guerre, mais il la préfère encore au déchaînement de Caliban. — « Si l’Inde recourt à la violence, que ce soit à la violence disciplinée, à la guerre ! En aucun cas, la populace ![76] » Il se défie même des démonstrations joyeuses et tapageuses, mais confuses, d’où l’on ne sait jamais s’il n’en sortira point la frénésie et des actes sans nom. « Il faut faire surgir l’ordre de ce chaos. Il faut substituer à la populace la loi du peuple. » Et ce mystique aux yeux précis, dont le robuste sens pratique n’est pas inférieur à celui de nos grands mystiques Européens, organisateurs d
U||Ordres et dominateurs d’âmes, donne des règles minutieuses pour canaliser le torrent des manifestations populaires.
U||[75] Ce que Karl Marx appelle « la Voyoucratie ».
U||[76] 8 septembre 1920.
U||    « Notre faute grave, dit-il, est d’avoir négligé la musique. La musique signifie le rythme et l’ordre. Malheureusement, elle est restée dans l’Inde l’apanage d’un petit nombre. Elle n’a jamais été nationalisée… Il faudrait faire chanter par des groupes des chants nationaux. Que de grands musiciens assistent à tous les Congrès et enseignent la musique de masses ! Rien de plus facile que de dresser la populace qui n’a pas de volonté suivie… »
U||Suit une liste de prescriptions :
U||    1o Ne pas accepter, dans les grandes manifestations, de volontaires novices. Placer en tête les plus éprouvés ; 2o remettre à chaque volontaire un livret général d’instructions ; 3o convenir de sifflets d’appel entre volontaires ; 4o imposer à la foule l’obéissance aux volontaires, sans discussion ; 5o fixer les cris nationaux et les moments précis où ils doivent être poussés ; ne tolérer aucune infraction à la règle ; 6o obliger la foule à faire la haie sur les routes, de façon à ne pas bloquer le passage des voitures ; lui interdire l’entrée des gares ; ne pas permettre qu’elle amène de petits enfants dans les attroupements… etc.
U||Bref, Gandhi se fait le chef d’orchestre de ces océans d’hommes.
U||    « La plus rude tâche pour la nation est de discipliner ses manifestations. »[77]
U||[77] 8 et 24 septembre, 20 octobre 1920.
U||La foule ne veut la violence que par intermittences ; ou plutôt, elle ne sait ce qu’elle veut, elle s’abandonne à de brusques poussées, des élans contradictoires. Mais une partie de l’élite hindoue veut délibérément la violence ; elle ne comprend pas la pensée de Gandhi, ni surtout son efficacité politique. Gandhi reçoit des lettres anonymes, qui le prient de ne pas s’opposer à la violence, ou qui — (suprême affront !) — expriment la cynique croyance que ses paroles ne sont qu’une feinte pour tromper l’ennemi, et qui le pressent de donner le signal du combat. Gandhi répond vivement. Il a des discussions passionnées. En de très beaux articles, il combat « la doctrine du glaive »[78]. Il conteste que les Écritures hindoues et le Coran aient prescrit la violence. La violence n’est le Credo d’aucune religion. Jésus est le prince de la résistance passive. La Bhagavad-Gîtâ n’enseigne pas la violence, mais l’accomplissement du devoir, au péril de sa vie[79].
U|| « L’homme ne possède pas le pouvoir de créer ; il ne possède donc pas le droit de détruire… » Il faut aimer même celui qui fait le mal : ce qui ne veut pas dire qu’on tolère le mal. Gandhi soignerait le général Dyer, s’il était malade. Mais si son propre fils vivait une vie de honte, « mon amour exigerait, écrit-il, que je lui retire mon soutien, quand même cela signifierait sa mort ». On n’a pas le droit de contraindre le méchant par la force. Mais on a le devoir de lui résister, en se séparant de lui, quoi qu’il en coûte. Et quand l’ennemi se repent, il faut lui ouvrir les bras[80].
U||[78] 11 août, 25 août 1920.
U||[79] Telle est du moins l’interprétation de Gandhi. Un Européen osera-t-il dire qu’il voit dans la Bhagavad Gîtâ tout au moins l’indifférence sereine à la violence commise et subie ?
U||[80] 25 août 1920.
U||Dans le même temps qu’il refrène les violents, il stimule les hésitants. Il rassure ceux qui reculent devant l’action directe :
U||    « Rien n’a été fait sur terre sans action directe. J’ai rejeté les mots : résistance passive, pour leur insuffisance… C’est l’action directe qui, dans le Sud-Afrique, a converti le général Smuts… Quelle est la plus grande symbiose qu’aient réalisée Christ et Buddha ? Celle de la force et de la douceur. Buddha a porté la guerre dans le camp ennemi, il a fait s’agenouiller une prêtrise arrogante. Christ a chassé les marchands du temple, il a flagellé les hypocrites et les pharisiens. C’est de l’action directe la plus intense… Et en même temps, derrière leurs actes, une douceur infinie…[81]
U||[81] 12 mai 1920.
U||Il fait aussi appel au cœur et à la raison des Anglais[82]. Il les nomme ses « chers amis » ; il leur rappelle qu’il a été pendant trente ans leur fidèle compagnon ; il leur demande de faire justice des perfidies de leur gouvernement. « La traîtrise de celui-ci a brisé ma foi en lui. Mais je crois encore à la bravoure anglaise. L’Inde ne peut vous opposer maintenant que la bravoure morale. La Non-coopération est le sacrifice de soi-même. Je veux vous conquérir par mes souffrances… »
U||[82] « A tous les Anglais de l’Inde », 27 octobre 1920.
U||Sa campagne de quatre à cinq mois n’eut pas seulement pour objet de paralyser le gouvernement anglais par la Non-acceptation, mais d’organiser une Inde nouvelle, capable de se suffire à elle-même et de se créer, matériellement et moralement une activité indépendante. Le premier point était de lui assurer l’indépendance économique. C’est ce que Gandhi appelle le Swadeshi. (Ou plutôt, c’est parmi les divers sens du mot, le plus immédiat et le plus pratique).
U||Évidemment, il fallait que l’Inde apprît à se priver de beaucoup de satisfactions matérielles, qu’elle acceptât sans plaintes bien des incommodités. Salubre discipline. Hygiène nécessaire. La santé de la race y trouverait son avantage, autant que la loi morale. Il fallait, avant tout, arracher de l’Inde « la malédiction de la boisson », former des groupes de tempérance, boycotter les vins, décider les vendeurs à renoncer à leurs patentes[83]. L’Inde comprit l’appel du Mahatma. Une vague de tempérance passa sur le pays ; et il fallut que Gandhi s’interposât, pour empêcher que la foule ne fermât de force et ne saccageât les magasins. Car « il n’est pas permis de rendre les gens purs, par force ».
U||[83] 28 avril 1920, 8 juin, 1er septembre 1921. Dans sa Lettre aux Parsis, qui sont grands commerçants, Gandhi les adjure de fermer leurs magasins de boissons (23 mars 1921). Dans sa Lettre aux modérés (8 juin 1921), il leur demande même s’ils ne sont pas d’accord avec lui pour le reste du programme, d’appuyer ses efforts sur ce point. En même temps que les boissons, il combat le commerce des drugs, des stupéfiants, les fumeries d’opium.
U||Mais s’il était relativement facile de renoncer au fléau de la boisson, il était autrement grave d’assurer à l’Inde les moyens de subsistance. Comment se nourrirait-elle ? Comment se vêtirait-elle, une fois rejetés les produits européens ? La recette de Gandhi est d’une simplicité extrême, où s’accusent les tendances médiévales de son esprit : il veut qu’on rétablisse dans toutes les familles de l’Inde la vieille industrie domestique du Rouet (charkâ).
U||On a pu tourner en dérision cette solution patriarcale de la question sociale[84]. Mais il faut tâcher de comprendre les conditions spéciales de l’Inde, et le sens exact que Gandhi donne à la charkâ. Il n’a jamais prétendu que le filage fût un moyen suffisant de vivre, sauf pour les très pauvres, mais une industrie auxiliaire de l’agriculture, quand celle-ci est suspendue. Le problème n’est pas théorique ; il est poignant et urgent : 80% de la population de l’Inde sont agricoles et n’ont pas d’occupations pendant quatre mois de l’année. Un dixième de la population est normalement affamé. La classe moyenne est sous-nourrie. L’Angleterre n’a rien fait pour améliorer cet état ; elle l’a considérablement aggravé. Les Compagnies anglaises ont ruiné les industries locales, pompé les ressources de l’Inde, et lui sucent annuellement près de quarante millions de livres sterling[85]. L’Inde, qui produit tout le coton dont elle a besoin, en exporte des millions de balle
U||s au Japon et au Lancashire, d’où il lui revient sous la forme de calicot manufacturé. De toute évidence, il faut qu’elle apprenne à se passer des services ruineux de l’étranger, et qu’elle organise au plus vite ses propres ateliers ; il faut qu’au plus vite elle trouve quelque moyen de fournir à chacun travail et subsistance. Or, il n’en est pas de plus prompt et de plus économique que l’industrie de chaumière, la vieille industrie hindoue, le filage et tissage. Il ne s’agit pas de mettre au tissage les travailleurs agricoles occupés et gagnant bien, mais d’une part les chômeurs et flâneurs, de l’autre les femmes et les enfants, enfin tous les Hindous à leurs heures de loisirs. Gandhi prescrit donc : 1o de boycotter le tissu étranger ; 2o de restaurer et répandre l’enseignement, très facile, du filage ; 3o de s’engager à ne plus porter que les étoffes ainsi filées et tissées. Il se voue à cette propagande, avec une ardeur inlassable. Il veut que filer soit u
U||n devoir pour l’Inde entière[86], qu’on l’apprenne à l’école, que les enfants pauvres paient leur éducation en heures de rouet, que chacun, homme ou femme, y consacre une heure de bienfaisance par jour. Il entre dans les détails les plus précis, donne des indications techniques sur le coton, le fil, les diverses opérations de tissage, des conseils pratiques aux tisserands, aux acheteurs, aux pères de famille, aux écoliers ; montre, chiffres en main, comment, avec un petit capital, on peut en montant une boutique de Swadeshi (de produits du travail indien) réaliser des profits de 10%, etc. Il devient lyrique, lorsqu’il célèbre « la musique du rouet »[87], la plus antique de l’Inde, celle dont se délectaient Kabir, le poète tisserand, et Aureng-Zeb, le grand empereur qui fabriquait lui-même ses bonnets… Il réussit à enflammer l’opinion. A Bombay, les dames de grande famille se mettent au rouet. Hindoues et musulmanes font vœu de ne plus porter d’autre étoffe que les
U|| tissus nationaux. La mode s’enthousiasme pour le Khaddar ou Khadi, dont Rabindranath Tagore lui-même reconnaît le bon goût. Les commandes affluent ; il en vient jusque du Beloutchistan et d’Aden.
U||[84] Gandhi lui-même sait qu’on rira de lui. Mais, dit-il, l’aiguille a-t-elle cédé la place à la machine à coudre, ou la main à la machine à écrire ? Le rouet n’a rien perdu de son utilité. Et il est actuellement une nécessité nationale, la seule ressource possible pour les millions d’affamés (21 juillet 1920).

U||L’enthousiasme alla un peu loin, quand il s’agit de boycotter les tissus étrangers ; et Gandhi lui-même, si maître de lui à l’ordinaire, paraît avoir perdu la mesure. Il ordonna de les brûler, comme un emblème d’esclavage ; et l’on vit à Bombay, en août 1921, comme au temps de Savonarole, Christo regnante, sur la Place de la Seigneurie, des bûchers de splendides étoffes de famille, consumées par le feu, au milieu d’une joie tumultueuse. Un des plus généreux esprits anglais de l’Inde, C.-F. Andrews, ami de Tagore, écrivit à Gandhi, qu’il admirait, une lettre pathétique, déplorant qu’on brûlât ces étoffes au lieu de les donner aux pauvres, et qu’on fît appel aux mauvais instincts de race. Il s’élève contre ce nationalisme, qui est une forme de la violence ; il ne peut supporter qu’on fasse de la destruction une sorte de religion : détruire le fruit du travail est un crime. Andrews, qui avait d’abord épousé les réformes de Gandhi, au point de porter le
U|| Khaddar, hésite maintenant à le garder : la vue de ces bûchers l’a blessé dans sa foi en le Mahâtmâ. Mais Gandhi, qui publie sa lettre et y répond affectueusement, touché de cette effusion d’un cœur angoissé, déclare qu’il ne regrette rien. Il n’a aucun sentiment hostile pour quelque race que ce soit, et il ne demande pas la destruction de tous les objets étrangers, mais de ceux dont la malfaisance s’est manifestée. Des millions d’indiens ont été ruinés par les manufactures anglaises ; beaucoup sont tombés au rang de parias, ou de soldats mercenaires, et leurs femmes de prostituées. On ne peut sans péché porter ces étoffes criminelles. L’Inde n’est que trop portée à haïr ses exploiteurs anglais. Gandhi détourne sa rancune et la transfère des hommes sur les choses. Les coupables ne sont pas seulement les Anglais qui ont vendu ces tissus, mais les Indiens qui les ont achetés. On brûle, non par haine, mais par repentir. C’est une opération chirurgicale nécessai
U||re. Et il serait inconvenant de donner ces étoffes souillées aux pauvres, qui ont, eux aussi, leur honneur.
U||Libérer la vie matérielle de l’asservissement étranger ne serait rien encore. Il faut libérer l’esprit. Gandhi voulut que son pays secouât le joug de la culture européenne ; et un de ses plus fiers efforts fut de jeter les bases d’une éducation vraiment indienne.
U||Déjà existaient quelques universités et collèges, où s’étaient conservés, sous la tutelle anglaise, des tisons de l’ancienne culture asiatique. Aligarh était depuis quarante-cinq ans une université musulmane, centre de la culture islamique dans l’Inde. Le collège de Khalsa était le centre de la culture Sikh. Les Hindous avaient l’université de Bénarès. Mais ces institutions scolastiques un peu arriérées étaient soumises au gouvernement, qui les subventionnait. Gandhi aurait voulu les détruire, pour y substituer des foyers plus purs. En novembre 1920, il inaugura l’Université nationale du Gujerat, à Ahmedabad. Elle s’inspirait des idéals d’une Inde unie. Ses deux piliers religieux étaient le Dharma des Hindous et l’Islam des Mahométans. Elle prétendait sauver les dialectes de l’Inde et en faire les sources de régénération nationale. Gandhi considère, à juste raison[88] — et nous pouvons faire notre profit de ses paroles — « qu’une étude systématique de
U||s cultures asiatiques n’est pas moins essentielle à une éducation complète que l’étude des sciences d’Occident. Les vastes trésors du sanscrit et de l’arabe, du persan, du pâli et du magadhi, doivent être explorés, afin que l’on retrouve les secrets de la force nationale ». Mais il n’est pas question de répéter ce qui fut dit ou fait, aux temps écoulés. « Il faut fonder une culture nouvelle sur celles du passé, enrichies par l’expérience des siècles. Elle doit être la synthèse des civilisations différentes, qui ont agi sur l’Inde et subi l’esprit du sol. Cette synthèse ne sera point effectuée sur le modèle américain, où une culture dominante absorbe et écrase tout le reste. Chaque culture aura sa place légitime. Le but est harmonie, et non unité factice par la force. » Tous les étudiants auront à connaître toutes les religions indiennes. Les hindous se familiariseront avec le Coran, et les musulmans avec les Shâstras. L’Université nationale n’excl
U||ut rien que l’esprit d’exclusion. Dans l’humanité entière, elle n’admet point d’« intouchables ». L’hindoustani sera obligatoire, car il est le vrai dialecte national, mélangé de sanscrit, de hindi, et de urdu persianisé[89].
U||[88] 17 novembre 1920.
U||[89] L’anglais n’est pas exclu, (ni aucune langue européenne). On le réserve aux cours supérieurs, à la fin du cycle scolaire. En revanche, les dialectes sont employés, à tous les degrés universitaires. Gandhi rêve d’un état supérieur de l’existence universelle, où toutes ces différences persistent dans l’unité, non pas comme des divisions, mais « comme les facettes d’une même pierrerie. » (juin 1920).
U||Les intellectuels recevront l’éducation professionnelle, et les autres l’éducation littéraire. Ainsi s’atténueront les différences de classes. L’esprit d’indépendance sera entretenu non seulement par l’étude, mais par une éducation que Gandhi nomme « vocationnelle »[90]. A l’encontre de l’éducation européenne qui déprécie le travail manuel en ne développant que le cerveau, Gandhi veut que le travail manuel soit introduit à l’école, dès les classes enfantines. Il est bon que l’enfant paye lui-même en travail de filage son enseignement, afin qu’il apprenne sans retard à gagner sa vie et son indépendance. Quant à l’éducation du cœur, que l’Europe néglige complètement, elle est toute à fonder. Et, avant de former les élèves, il faut former les éducateurs.
U||[90] On ne doit pas traduire « professionnelle », car il s’agit justement de dégager l’âme de la profession.
U||C’est l’objet d’instituts supérieurs, dont il semble que Gandhi rêve de faire la clef de voûte de l’éducation nouvelle, — bien plus qu’écoles, véritables couvents où se concentre, pour être ensuite propagé, le feu sacré de l’Inde, — ainsi que les grands monastères des Bénédictins d’Occident, religieux pionniers de la terre et de l’âme.
U||Nous possédons les règlements que Gandhi établit pour la maison Satyâgraha Ashram[91], à Ahmedabad, sa fille préférée. Ils concernent beaucoup plus les maîtres que les élèves, et ils lient les premiers par des vœux monastiques. Mais au lieu que, dans les couvents ordinaires, ces vœux, avec le temps, ne gardent plus qu’un caractère de discipline négative, ils sont ici palpitants de l’esprit de sacrifice et de pur amour qui anime les saints. Les directeurs sont tenus aux observances qui suivent :
U||[91] Ashram : lieu de discipline, ermitage.
U||1o Le vœu de Vérité. — Il ne suffit pas de ne pas mentir. « Aucun mensonge ne doit être employé, même pour le bien du pays. » La vérité peut exiger l’opposition aux parents et aux aînés.
U||2o Le vœu de « Ahimsâ » (Non-tuer). — Il ne suffit pas de ne pas prendre la vie d’un autre être. Il ne faut pas blesser même ceux qu’on croit être injustes. On ne doit jamais être irrité contre eux ; il faut les aimer. S’opposer à la tyrannie, mais ne point faire de mal au tyran. Le vaincre par l’amour. Lui refuser l’obéissance, jusqu’à la mort.
U||3o Le vœu de Célibat, sans lequel il est presque impossible d’observer les deux précédents. — Il ne suffit pas d’éviter la concupiscence. Il faut toujours contrôler ses passions animales, même dans sa pensée. Si l’on est marié, on doit regarder sa femme comme une amie pour la vie, et garder avec elle des relations de pureté parfaite.
U||4o « Le contrôle du palais ». — Il faut régler et purifier son régime. Abandonner graduellement les aliments qui ne sont pas nécessaires.
U||5o Le vœu de Non-voler. — Il ne s’agit pas seulement de la propriété des autres. « C’est un vol d’employer des objets, dont nous n’avons pas réellement besoin. » La nature fournit, de jour en jour, juste assez et pas plus pour nos besoins quotidiens.
U||6o Le vœu de Non-possession. — Il ne suffit pas de ne pas posséder. Il ne faut rien garder que d’absolument nécessaire pour nos besoins corporels. Éliminer constamment le trop. Simplifier la vie.
U||Deux observances « subsidiaires » s’ajoutent à ces vœux essentiels :
U||1o Le Swadeshi. — Ne pas employer d’objets pour lesquels il y ait une possibilité de tromperie. Cette prescription entraîne l’interdiction des objets manufacturés au dehors. Car ils sont le produit de la misère exploitée et des souffrances du peuple ouvrier d’Europe. Les marchandises étrangères sont donc « tabou » pour un disciple de l’Ahimsâ. D’où la nécessité de vêtements simples, faits dans le pays.
U||2o L’absence de crainte. — Car celui qui craint ne peut suivre les préceptes précédents. Il faut être libre de la peur des rois, des peuples, de la famille, des hommes et des bêtes féroces, de la mort. Un homme sans peur se défend par la « force de vérité » ou « force d’âme ».
U||Une fois bâtis les caractères sur cette armature de fer, Gandhi passe rapidement sur les autres prescriptions éducatives, dont les deux plus frappantes sont celles-ci : les maîtres doivent donner l’exemple du travail corporel (de préférence, du travail de la terre) ; et ils doivent apprendre les principales langues de l’Inde.
U||Quant aux enfants, une fois entrés à l’Ashram — et on peut les y mettre dès l’âge de quatre ans[92] — ils sont liés eux aussi jusqu’à leur sortie — (et le cycle des études dure environ dix ans). Ils sont séparés de leurs familles. Les parents renoncent à tout contrôle. Les enfants ne visitent pas les parents. Ils ont des vêtements simples, une nourriture simple, strictement végétarienne, pas de jours de congé au sens habituel, mais un jour et demi par semaine laissé au travail personnel, et trois mois par an consacrés au voyage à pied à travers l’Inde. Le hindi et un dialecte dravidien sont obligatoires pour tous. Ils doivent de plus apprendre l’anglais comme deuxième langue, et les caractères de cinq langues indiennes (urdu, bengali, tamil, telugu et devanagari). On leur enseigne, dans leurs dialectes propres, l’histoire, la géographie, les mathématiques, les sciences économiques, et le sanscrit. Parallèlement, ils pratiquent l’agriculture et le tissage à la mai
U||n. Il va sans dire qu’un esprit religieux enveloppe tout l’enseignement. Quand les études sont à leur fin, les jeunes gens ont le choix : prendre les vœux comme leurs aînés, ou se retirer. Tout l’enseignement est gratuit.
U||[92] Mais on peut être admis comme étudiant, à tout âge.
U||J’ai insisté un peu longuement sur ce programme éducatif, parce qu’il montre la haute spiritualité du mouvement de Gandhi, et que, dans ses intentions, il en est le principal moteur. Pour créer l’Inde nouvelle, il faut créer des âmes nouvelles, des âmes fortes et pures, qui soient vraiment indiennes. Et il faut, pour les créer, former une légion sacrée d’apôtres qui, tels ceux du Christ, soient le sel de la terre. Gandhi n’est pas, comme nos révolutionnaires d’Europe, un fabricant de lois et de décrets. Il est le pétrisseur d’une nouvelle humanité.
U||Le gouvernement anglais — comme tous les gouvernements en pareil cas — n’avait, naturellement, rien compris à ce qui se passait. Son premier mouvement fut d’ironie supérieure. Le vice-roi, lord Chelmsford, en août 1920, dit que « de toutes les absurdités, celle-là était la plus absurde ». Il fallut bientôt descendre de ces régions de dédain confortable. Assez troublé déjà, mais incertain, le gouvernement publia, le 6 novembre 1920, un communiqué paterne et menaçant, disant qu’il n’avait pas voulu instituer de poursuites criminelles, parce que les promoteurs du mouvement prêchaient l’abstention de violence, mais qu’ordre d’agir était donné contre qui dépasserait les limites posées et pousserait à la violence ou à la désobéissance armée.
U||Les limites furent vite dépassées, mais par le gouvernement. Le mouvement avait pris une extension inquiétante. Et en décembre 1920, se produisit un événement d’une gravité exceptionnelle. La Non-coopération sans violence n’avait été jusque-là qu’une tactique d’essai, d’un caractère provisoire ; et le gouvernement se flattait de l’espoir que l’Assemblée générale indienne, dans sa session de fin d’année, l’abrogerait. Mais le Congrès national de toute l’Inde, réuni à Nagpur, l’inscrivit, au contraire, dans la Constitution, comme premier article de loi :
U||Article I. « L’objet du Congrès National est d’atteindre le Swarâj (Home Rule) du peuple de l’Inde, par tous les moyens pacifiques et légitimes. »
U||Il confirma le vote de Non-coopération qu’avait émis la session spéciale de Calcutta en septembre 1920, et il l’amplifia, soulignant le principe de Non-violence, montrant la nécessité, pour la victoire, d’une harmonie entre les éléments divers du pays, et par conséquent prônant l’unité hindoue-musulmane, bien plus, le rapprochement entre les classes privilégiées et refoulées. Surtout, il introduisit dans la Constitution des changements fondamentaux, qui établirent définitivement le régime représentatif de toutes les parties de l’Inde[93]. Le Congrès ne cachait point que la Non-coopération actuelle n’était encore qu’un premier échelon de la lutte engagée. Il annonçait que le refus complet d’association avec le gouvernement et le refus de paiement des taxes entreraient en vigueur, à un moment qui serait ultérieurement déterminé. En attendant, pour y préparer le pays, on étendait le boycott, on encourageait le tissage indien, on lançait un appel aux étudiants, aux 
U||parents, aux magistrats ; on les invitait à pratiquer avec plus de zèle la Non-coopération. Ceux qui refuseraient d’obéir aux prescriptions du Congrès seraient exclus de la vie publique.
U||[93] Au Congrès de Nagpur prenaient part plus de 4.726 délégués dont 469 musulmans, 65 sikhs, 5 parsis, 2 intouchables, 4.079 hindous, 106 femmes.
U||La Constitution nouvelle décida qu’un délégué serait nommé pour 50.000 habitants : ce qui ferait au total 6.173 délégués. Le Congrès National de toute l’Inde se réunit en session, une fois par an (vers Noël). Le Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde, comprenant environ 350 membres, est chargé d’exécuter la politique du Congrès, en interprétant ses résolutions ; il possède, dans l’intervalle des sessions du Congrès, la même autorité que lui. Un Comité exécutif de 15 membres joue le rôle de Cabinet, par rapport au Parlement ; il peut être congédié par le Comité du Congrès.
U||Le Congrès de Nagpur dressa les plans d’une hiérarchie de Comités de Congrès provinciaux, représentant 21 provinces et 12 langues — et, au-dessous, des Comités de Congrès locaux pour tous les villages ou groupes de villages, — avec des troupes d’« ouvriers » ou fonctionnaires nationaux (Service national Indien) entretenus par un fond Swarâj de toute l’Inde, en mémoire de Tilak.
U||Tout homme ou toute femme, adulte, souscrivant quatre annas au fonds du Congrès est électeur, sous la condition préalable qu’il ait signé le Credo de la Constitution. L’âge d’éligibilité est 21 ans. La condition est d’accepter l’article 1 de la Constitution, les règlements et les méthodes du Congrès.
U||C’était l’affirmation d’un État dans l’État, le véritable État de l’Inde en face du Gouvernement britannique. Celui-ci ne pouvait plus rester sans agir. Il fallait traiter, ou combattre. Avec un peu d’esprit conciliant, une entente était encore possible. Le Congrès avait déclaré qu’il atteindrait à son but, « en association avec l’Angleterre, si elle s’y prêtait, sinon sans elle. » Comme toujours dans la politique européenne à l’égard des autres races, la violence l’emporta. On chercha des prétextes. Ils ne manquèrent point.
U||Malgré la volonté de Non-violence, affermée par Gandhi et par le Congrès, quelques graves désordres, qui n’avaient avec le mouvement de Non-coopération que des rapports assez lointains, se produisirent sur divers points de l’Inde. Dans les Provinces-Unies (Allahabad), il y eut des troubles agraires, des révoltes de tenanciers contre les propriétaires ; et la police y intervint d’une façon sanglante. Puis, le mouvement Akali des Sikhs, d’abord purement religieux, employa les méthodes de la Non-coopération, et aboutit, en février 1921, au massacre de deux cents Sikhs. On ne pouvait, de bonne foi, rendre responsables de ce drame du fanatisme Gandhi et ses disciples. Mais l’occasion était bonne. La répression reprit, au début de mars 1921, avec une violence croissante jusqu’à la fin de l’année. Elle avait choisi, pour entrer en scène, le prétexte des manifestations contre les vendeurs de boissons. Ce n’était pas la première fois que l’alcoolisme et la civilisation europé
U||enne marchaient de pair. Le Congrès indien leva le fonds Swaraj-Tilak, montant à dix millions de roupies, pour enrôler dix millions de membres et pour élever le nombre des charkhas à vingt lakhs (2 millions). En août 1921, une résolution fut passée pour effectuer le boycott complet du tissu étranger, le 30 septembre. Le gouvernement y répondit par des mesures violentes. A la fin novembre, une loi fut promulguée contre les meetings séditieux. En diverses provinces, carte blanche fut donnée à la police locale pour écraser le mouvement, qu’on dénomma révolutionnaire et anarchique. Des milliers d’indiens furent arrêtés ; on n’eut aucun égard pour des hommes respectés[94]. Naturellement, ces mesures provoquèrent des émeutes, et çà et là, des combats entre la police et la foule, des meurtres, des incendies.
U||[94] Lajpat Rai fut le premier arrêté, le 3 décembre 1921, au nom de la loi criminelle du 24 novembre 1921.
U||Le Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde, réuni à Bezwada, dans la dernière semaine de mars, discuta s’il fallait proclamer la Désobéissance civile. Avec une rare sagesse, il trouva que le pays n’était pas encore assez mûr et discipliné pour employer cette arme à double tranchant ; et il décida d’attendre, en procédant à une sorte de mobilisation civile et financière.
U||Gandhi reprit, avec plus d’élan, sa campagne pour l’unité de l’Inde, pour l’union des religions, des races, des partis et des castes. Il fit appel aux Parsis[95], riches, gros commerçants, grands industriels, et plus ou moins teintés, comme il dit, de l’esprit Rockfeller. — L’union hindoue-musulmane était sans cesse menacée par les anciens préjugés, les craintes, les soupçons mutuels. Il s’y voua, corps et âme[96], ne cherchant pas entre les deux peuples une fusion actuellement impossible, et que lui-même n’eût point voulue, mais une solide alliance bâtie sur l’amitié[97].
U||[95] 23 mars 1921.
U||[96] 6 octobre 1920, 11 mai, 18 mai, 28 juillet, 20 octobre 1921.
U||[97] Donnant en exemple son amitié intime avec le musulman Maulana Mohamed Ali, il atteste que l’un et l’autre restent fidèles à leur foi respective. Gandhi ne donnerait pas sa fille en mariage à un des fils d’Ali ; il ne partagerait pas les repas de son ami ; et son ami agirait de même. Cela ne les empêche point de s’aimer et d’être sûrs l’un de l’autre. Gandhi ne prétend point, d’ailleurs, que les mariages mixtes entre Hindous et Musulmans, et les repas en commun soient à condamner ; mais il faudra un siècle pour en arriver à cette fusion. Une politique pratique ne doit pas poursuivre une telle réforme. Gandhi n’y met pas obstacle ; mais il la croit prématurée. Ici se montre encore son sens des réalités (20 octobre 1921).
U||Son effort le plus haut fut de faire rentrer dans la communauté hindoue les classes rejetées. Sa revendication passionnée des droits des Parias, ses cris d’indignation et de douleur contre cette monstrueuse iniquité sociale, suffiraient à immortaliser son nom. La souffrance que lui causait ce qu’il nomme « la plus honteuse souillure de l’Hindouisme » avait sa source dans ses émotions d’enfance. Il raconte[98] que, lorsqu’il était petit, un paria venait dans sa maison pour les grossiers ouvrages ; on défendit à l’enfant de le frôler sans faire des ablutions ; il ne l’admettait point et discutait avec ses parents. A l’école, souvent il touchait les intouchables. Sa mère lui recommandait, pour se défaire de la souillure, de toucher ensuite un musulman. Mais, à douze ans, son jugement était fait. Il se jurait d’effacer ce péché de la conscience de l’Inde. Il projetait de venir au secours de ses frères dégradés. Jamais son esprit ne se montre plus libre que quand 
U||il sert leur cause. On en jugera par ce fait qu’il eût été prêt à sacrifier sa religion même, s’il lui avait été prouvé que l’intouchabilité en fût un dogme. Et cette seule injustice justifie, à ses yeux, toutes celles dont les Indiens souffrent dans l’univers…
U||[98] Dans un discours public, le 27 avril 1921.
U||    « Si les Indiens sont devenus les parias de l’Empire, c’est un retour de la justice éternelle. Que les Indiens d’abord lavent leurs mains tachées de sang !… L’intouchabilité a dégradé l’Inde. Au Sud-Afrique, en Afrique orientale, au Canada, les Indiens, à leur tour, ont été traités en parias. Le Swarâj (Home Rule) est impossible, tant que subsisteront les parias. L’Inde est coupable. L’Angleterre n’a rien fait de plus noir. Le premier devoir est de protéger les faibles, et de ne pas outrager une conscience humaine. Nous ne valons pas mieux que des brutes, tant que nous ne serons pas lavés de ce péché. Le Swarâj doit être le règne de la justice sur toute la terre… »[99]
U||[99] 27 octobre 1920, 27 avril 1921.
U||Gandhi voulait qu’une législature nationale améliorât au plus tôt le sort des frères parias, qu’on leur accordât un grand nombre d’écoles et de puits — car l’usage des puits publics leur était interdit. — Mais d’ici là ?… Son impatience, qui ne lui permet pas d’attendre, les bras croisés, que les classes privilégiées aient réparé leur iniquité, le fait passer dans le camp des parias : il se met à leur tête, et cherche à les grouper. Il examine avec eux les tactiques diverses : que peuvent-ils ? En appeler au gouvernement de l’Inde ? Ce serait changer d’esclavage… Rejeter l’Hindouisme — (Que l’on remarque cette généreuse audace d’un grand croyant hindou !) — et se convertir au christianisme ou au mahométisme ? Gandhi serait près de le conseiller, si l’Hindouisme était inséparable de l’intouchabilité. Mais il est convaincu que celle-ci n’en est qu’une excroissance malsaine, et qu’on doit l’extirper. Les parias devraient donc s’o
U||rganiser pour leur défense. Ils auraient la ressource d’employer l’arme de la Non-coopération contre l’Hindouisme, en cessant toutes relations avec les autres hindous : (conseils singulièrement hardis de révolte sociale, dans la bouche de ce Patriote !) Mais, continue Gandhi, les parias ne sont capables d’aucune organisation ; ils n’ont point de chefs. Qu’ils se joignent donc — c’est le seul parti qui leur reste — au mouvement général de Non-coopération indienne, dont la première condition est l’union des classes ! La Non-coopération véritable est un acte religieux de purification. Nul ne peut y prendre part, en rejetant les parias ; il pécherait gravement. Ainsi, Gandhi réussit à mettre d’accord la religion, la patrie et l’humanité[100].
U||[100] 27 octobre 1920.
U||Une consécration solennelle fut donnée à ces premiers essais de groupement, par la Conférence des classes « supprimées » (Suppressed Classes Conference), que Gandhi présida à Ahmedabad, les 13 et 14 avril 1921. Il y prononça un de ses plus beaux discours. Il ne se contente pas de réclamer la suppression de l’inégalité sociale ; il attend des parias de grandes choses dans la vie sociale de l’Inde régénérée ; il leur rend confiance en eux ; il leur souffle la brûlante espérance qui l’anime. Il a remarqué chez eux, dit-il, d’immenses possibilités latentes. Il compte qu’en cinq mois les classes intouchables auront su, par leur dignité, conquérir leur juste place dans la grande famille indienne.
U||Gandhi eut la joie de voir l’Inde émue par l’appel fait à son cœur, et l’émancipation des parias se réaliser en de nombreuses régions[101]. La veille de son arrestation, il s’occupait encore de cette cause, et en relatait les progrès. Des Brahmanes s’y consacraient. Les classes privilégiées donnèrent des exemples touchants de repentir et d’amour fraternel. Gandhi cite le cas d’un jeune Brahmane de dix-huit ans, qui se fit balayeur, pour vivre avec les parias[102].
U||[101] Dès la fin d’avril 1921, l’intouchabilité diminue. Dans beaucoup de villages, les parias vivent parmi les autres Hindous et partagent leurs droits (27 avril 1921). En revanche, dans d’autres régions, particulièrement à Madras, leur situation restait déplorable (29 septembre 1921). — La question est désormais inscrite à l’ordre du jour des Assemblées Nationales indiennes. Déjà, le Congrès de Nagpur, en décembre 1920, avait émis le vœu que disparût le « péché » de l’intouchabilité.
U||[102] 27 avril 1921.
U||Gandhi prit parti, avec non moins de noblesse, pour une autre grande cause, celle des femmes.
U||La question sexuelle est particulièrement grave dans l’Inde, riche d’une sensualité débordante, accablante, et mal réglée. Les mariages d’enfants épuisent prématurément les énergies physiques et morales de la nation. L’obsession charnelle pèse sur la pensée ; et la dignité de la femme en est humiliée. Gandhi publie les plaintes de femmes hindoues contre la façon dégradante dont la femme est considérée par les nationalistes hindous[103]. Il donne raison à ces blâmes. C’est là, dit-il, une plaie de l’Inde, aussi grave que l’intouchabilité. Mais il ajoute que le monde entier en souffre. Le problème est universel. De même que pour les parias, il attend le progrès beaucoup plus des opprimés que des oppresseurs. C’est aux femmes qu’il s’adresse, pour que d’abord elles imposent le respect, en cessant de se regarder comme l’objet des appétits de l’homme. Qu’elles prennent part résolument à la vie publique, qu’elles en revendiquent les risques et les dangers
U|| ! Que non seulement elles renoncent à leur luxe, en rejetant et brûlant les tissus étrangers, mais qu’elles partagent toutes les peines des hommes ! Déjà, des femmes distinguées ont été emprisonnées à Calcutta. C’est bien. Que loin de réclamer un traitement de faveur, elles fassent assaut d’endurance et de privations avec les hommes ! Sur ce terrain, la femme peut toujours dépasser l’homme. Qu’elles ne redoutent rien ! La plus faible peut préserver son honneur. Il suffit de savoir mourir[104].
U||[103] 21 juillet 1921, 6 octobre 1920.
U||[104] 21 juillet, 11 août, 15 décembre 1921.
U||Il n’oublia point nos sœurs tombées[105]. Il raconte les conversations qu’il eut avec des assemblées de plusieurs centaines d’entre elles, dans la province Andhra, et à Barisal. Avec quelle simple noblesse il leur parle, elles lui parlent, elles se confient à lui, elles lui demandent conseil ! Il leur cherche un métier honorable, il leur propose le rouet, elles promettent de s’y mettre dès le lendemain, si on les aide. — Et, s’adressant aux hommes de l’Inde, Gandhi les rappelle au respect de la femme :
U||[105] C’est le titre d’un de ses articles : Our fallen sister (15 septembre 1921).
U||    « Cette façon de jouer au vice n’a pas sa place dans notre Révolution. Le Swarâj veut dire que nous considérons tous les habitants de l’Inde comme nos frères et nos sœurs… Respect à tous !… Le sexe féminin n’est pas le sexe faible, il est le plus noble des deux, par son pouvoir de sacrifice, de souffrance silencieuse, d’humilité, de foi et de connaissance. L’intuition de la femme a souvent surpassé l’arrogante prétention de l’homme à un savoir supérieur… »
U||Il trouva en les femmes de l’Inde — à commencer par la sienne — des aides intelligentes et de ses meilleures disciples.
U||III
U||L’année 1921 marque l’apogée de l’ascendant de Gandhi. Il dispose d’un immense pouvoir moral ; et, sans qu’il l’ait cherché, on lui met dans les mains un pouvoir politique presque illimité. Le peuple le croit saint ; on fait de lui des peintures en Shri-Krishna[106]. Et, en décembre 1921, le Congrès National de toute l’Inde l’investit de la pleine autorité, lui délègue ses pouvoirs, avec la faculté de choisir son successeur. Il est le maître incontesté de la nation indienne. Il dépend de lui de déchaîner la Révolution politique, ou même, s’il l’eût voulu, d’instaurer une Réforme religieuse.
U||[106] Gandhi proteste, dans Young India (juin 1921).
U||Il ne le fit pas. Il ne le voulut pas. Grandeur morale ? Timidité morale ? L’une et l’autre peut-être. Il est difficile à tout homme (particulièrement à un homme d’une civilisation différente), de pénétrer une conscience, surtout quand elle est aussi profonde et délicate que celle d’un Gandhi. Il est difficile d’apprécier, dans le tourbillon des faits qui, en cette année tumultueuse, remuèrent l’Inde en tous sens, si la main du pilote a toujours été sûre et gouverna le colossal navire, sans dévier ni trembler. Mais je tâcherai de dire ce que j’ai cru déchiffrer dans cette énigme vivante, avec le religieux respect que j’ai pour ce grand homme, et la sincérité que je dois à sa sincérité.
U||Si le pouvoir de Gandhi était grand, les dangers d’en user n’étaient pas moindres. A mesure que l’action publique s’étendait et que son frisson remuait les centaines de millions d’hommes, il devenait plus difficile de la diriger et de garder soi-même l’équilibre sur cette mer en mouvement. Problème surhumain de concilier la modération de l’esprit et la largeur de vue avec ces masses déchaînées ! Le pilote, doux et pieux, prie et s’appuie sur Dieu. Mais la voix qu’il entend lui arrive, mêlée à celle de la tempête. Arrivera-t-elle aux autres ?…
U||Ce qu’il risque le moins, c’est le danger d’orgueil. Aucune adoration ne peut lui tourner la tête. Il en est blessé dans son humilité, autant que dans son bon sens. Cas unique peut-être dans l’histoire des prophètes et des grands mystiques, il n’a point de visions, point de révélations, et il ne cherche ni à le croire, ni à le faire croire. Sincérité immaculée ! Son front reste sans ivresse, son cœur sans vanité. Il est, il demeure un homme pareil à tous les hommes… Non, qu’on ne l’appelle pas saint ! Il ne le veut point. (Et, par cela même, il l’est…)
U||    « Le mot Saint, écrit-il, doit être raturé de la vie actuelle… Je prie comme tout bon Hindou, je crois que nous pouvons tous être des messagers de Dieu ; mais je n’ai eu aucune révélation particulière de Dieu. Ma croyance ferme est qu’il se révèle à tout être humain ; mais nous fermons nos oreilles à la petite voix intérieure… Je prétends n’être qu’un humble ouvrier, un humble serviteur de l’Inde et de l’Humanité (a humble servant of India and humanity…) Je n’ai nul désir de fonder une secte. Je suis en vérité trop ambitieux. Je ne représente pas des vérités nouvelles. J’essaie de représenter et de suivre la Vérité, telle que je la connais. Je jette une lumière nouvelle sur maintes vieilles vérités. »[107]
U||[107] 12 mai 1920, 25 mai, 13 juillet, 25 août 1921.
U||Pour lui-même, il est donc toujours modeste, plein de scrupules, personnellement incapable de tout exclusivisme, aussi bien comme patriote indien que comme doctrinaire de la Non-coopération. Il n’admet aucune tyrannie, même pour la bonne cause. « On ne doit jamais remplacer l’esclavage du gouvernement par celui des Non-coopérateurs[108] ». Il se refuse aussi à opposer sa patrie aux autres patries ; et son patriotisme ne s’enferme pas dans les limites de l’Inde. « Pour moi, le patriotisme se confond avec l’humanité. Je suis patriote, parce que je suis homme et humain. Je ne suis pas exclusif. Je ne ferais pas de mal à l’Angleterre ou à l’Allemagne, pour servir l’Inde. L’impérialisme n’a pas de place dans mon plan de vie… Un patriote l’est d’autant moins qu’il est un tiède humanitaire[109] ».
U||[108] 8 décembre 1920.
U||[109] 16 mars 1921.
U||Mais ses disciples ont-ils toujours été aussi réservés ? Que devient sa doctrine, aux mains de certains d’entre eux ? Et, par leur intermédiaire, qu’en parvient-il à la foule ?
U||Quand Rabindranath Tagore, après un voyage de plusieurs années en Europe, rentre dans l’Inde, en août 1921, il est bouleversé du changement qu’il remarque dans les esprits. Son anxiété n’avait pas attendu son retour pour s’exprimer, en une suite de lettres, envoyées d’Europe à ses amis indiens, et dont plusieurs furent publiées dans sa Modern Review[110]. Il est nécessaire de s’arrêter sur ce dissentiment entre deux grands esprits, qui ont l’un pour l’autre estime et admiration, mais qui sont aussi fatalement séparés que peut l’être un sage d’un apôtre, d’un saint Paul un Platon. D’un côté, le génie de la foi et de la charité, qui veut être le levain d’une nouvelle humanité. De l’autre, celui de l’intelligence, libre, vaste et sereine, qui embrasse l’ensemble de toutes les existences.
U||[110] Letters from Abroad. Les trois lettres du 2, 5 et 13 mars 1921 ont été publiées dans la Modern Review de mai 1921. L’Appel de la vérité, écrit après le retour de Tagore aux Indes, parut dans la Modern Review du 1er octobre 1921.
U||En dehors de cette controverse écrite, nous savons que Tagore eut, après son retour, une entrevue personnelle avec Gandhi. Nul n’en a publié le récit. Mais C.-F. Andrews, qui en fut le seul témoin, a bien voulu nous faire part des sujets de discussion et des arguments opposés.
U||Tagore a toujours reconnu la sainteté de Gandhi ; et je l’ai entendu m’en parler avec vénération : comme j’évoquais, au sujet du Mahatma, la figure de Tolstoï, Tagore montrait combien Gandhi lui était plus proche et lui semblait plus vêtu de lumière — (et j’en juge de même, aujourd’hui que je le connais mieux), — car tout chez Gandhi est nature, simple, modeste et pure ; et la sérénité enveloppe ses combats. Au lieu que chez Tolstoï, tout est révolte orgueilleuse contre l’orgueil, colère contre la colère, passion contre les passions, tout est violence, jusqu’à la non-violence… Tagore écrivait de Londres, le 10 avril 1921 : « Nous sommes reconnaissants à Gandhi de donner à l’Inde l’occasion de prouver que sa foi à l’esprit divin dans l’homme est encore vivante. » Et malgré les réserves qu’il formulait déjà sur le mouvement de Gandhi, quand il quitta la France pour son voyage de retour, il était disposé à y apporter son aide. Même l’éclata
U||nt manifeste d’octobre 1921, que je citerai plus loin, l’Appel de la Vérité, qui consacre la rupture, s’ouvre par le plus magnifique éloge qui ait jamais été écrit de Gandhi.
U||De son côté, Gandhi témoigne à Tagore un respect affectueux ; et même dans leur désaccord, il s’applique à ne s’en point départir. On sent qu’il lui est pénible d’entrer en polémique avec lui ; et lorsque de bons amis essaient d’attiser le débat, en colportant certains propos intimes, Gandhi leur impose silence, en affirmant tout ce qu’il doit à Tagore[111].
U||[111] Ainsi, dans un de ses derniers articles, qu’il intitule : Trop sacré pour être publié (9 février 1922). — Tagore et Gandhi se connaissaient depuis longtemps. Gandhi avait séjourné plus d’une fois à Santiniketan, chez Tagore. Il avait la permission, dit-il, de considérer cette maison comme un lieu de retraite ; et, pendant qu’il était en Angleterre, ses enfants y furent élevés.
U||Mais il était fatal que la différence de leurs esprits s’affirmât. Dès l’été de 1920, Tagore avait regretté que la force débordante d’amour et de foi qui était en Gandhi fût mise, depuis la mort de Tilak, au service de la politique. Ce n’était certes pas de gaieté de cœur que Gandhi lui-même s’y était déterminé ; mais, Tilak mort, l’Inde était sans chef politique ; il fallait le remplacer.
U||    « Si je parais prendre part à la politique, dit-il expressément au moment où il s’y décide, c’est seulement parce que la politique nous enserre aujourd’hui, comme dans ses replis un serpent : on ne peut s’en dégager, quoi qu’on fasse. Je veux donc lutter avec le serpent… J’essaie d’introduire la religion dans la politique. »[112]
U||[112] 12 mai 1920.
U||Mais Tagore déplorait cette nécessité. Il écrivait, le 7 septembre 1920 :
U||    « Toute la ferveur morale que représente la vie de Mahâtmâ Gandhi, et que lui seul, entre tous les hommes du monde, peut représenter, nous est nécessaire. Qu’un trésor aussi précieux soit mis sur le frêle vaisseau de notre politique et lancé sur les flots sans fin des récriminations irritées est un grave malheur pour notre pays, dont la mission est de redonner la vie aux morts par le feu de l’âme… Le gaspillage de nos ressources spirituelles dans des aventures qui, du point de vue de la vérité morale, sont mauvaises, est navrant. Il est criminel de transformer la force morale en force aveugle. »[113]
U||[113] Et plus tard : « Tout honneur au Mahâtmâ ! Mais nos politiciens ne peuvent se défaire de l’idée de l’utiliser pour une manœuvre secrète et ingénieuse dans leur jeu, sur l’échiquier. » (1er octobre 1921).
U||Ces lignes lui étaient dictées par les débuts retentissants de la campagne de Non-coopération, et par l’agitation soulevée dans l’Inde, au nom du Khilafat et des crimes du Punjab. Il en redoutait les conséquences sur une population faible et sujette à des accès de fureur hystérique. Il eût voulu qu’on la détournât des pensées de vengeance ou d’impossible réparation, qu’on oubliât l’irréparable, pour ne songer qu’à construire l’âme de la plus grande Patrie. Autant il admirait, dans la pensée et l’action de Gandhi, le brûlant rayonnement de l’esprit de sacrifice (et il le dit dans une lettre du 2 mars 1921, que je reproduis plus loin), autant lui était antipathique l’élément de négation que renfermait la foi nouvelle, — la Non-coopération. Il avait horreur de tout ce qui était : non ! Et ce lui est une occasion d’opposer[114] l’idéal positif du Brahmanisme, la purification des joies de la vie, à leur arrachement exigé par l’idéal négatif du Bouddhi
U||sme. A quoi Gandhi répondra[115] que l’acte de rejeter n’est pas moins nécessaire que celui d’accepter. L’effort humain est fait des deux. Le mot final des Upanishads est une négation. Et la définition de Brahman par les auteurs des Upanishads est : Neti (Pas ceci !) L’Inde avait trop perdu la faculté de dire : « Non ! » Gandhi la lui a rendue. « Avant de semer, il faut sarcler… arracher le mal. »
U||[114] 5 mars 1921.
U||[115] 1er juin 1921.
U||Mais sans doute, Tagore ne désire-t-il rien arracher. Sa contemplation poétique s’accommode de tout ce qui est, et en goûte l’harmonie. Il l’exprime, en des pages qui sont d’une géniale beauté, mais d’un détachement extrême de l’action. C’est la danse de Nataraja, qui joue avec les illusions :
U||    « Je m’efforce, de tout mon pouvoir, d’accorder mon mode de pensée au diapason du grand sentiment d’excitation exaltée qui passe sur ma patrie. Mais, dans mon être, pourquoi cet esprit de résistance, malgré mon violent désir de l’écarter ? Je ne trouve pas de réponse claire ; mais dans les ténèbres de mon abattement, voici poindre un sourire et une voix qui dit : « Votre place est avec les enfants, sur la plage des mondes : là est votre paix ; et là, je suis avec vous. » Et c’est pourquoi je me suis joué récemment à inventer de nouveaux rythmes. Ce ne sont que des riens, joyeux d’être entraînés par le courant de l’heure, et dansant au soleil, et riant en disparaissant. Mais tandis que je me joue, la création entière se divertit : car les feuilles et les fleurs ne sont-elles pas des expériences de rythmes, qui ne finissent jamais ? Mon Dieu n’est-il pas l’éternel gaspilleur des temps ? Il jette étoiles et planètes dans le tourbillon des changeme
U||nts ; sur le torrent de l’Apparence, il lance les bateaux en papier des Ages, remplis de ses fantaisies. Quand je le tourmente et le supplie de me permettre de rester son petit disciple et d’accepter quelques bagatelles de ma composition comme cargaison de sa barque de jeu, il sourit et je trotte derrière lui, saisissant le bord de sa robe… Mais où suis-je, au milieu de la foule, poussé par derrière, pressé de tous côtés ? Et quel est ce bruit qui m’entoure ? Si c’est un chant, alors ma sitar peut en saisir la mélodie, et je me joins au chœur, car je suis un chanteur. Mais si c’est une clameur, alors ma voix est étouffée, et je suis étourdi. J’ai essayé, tous ces jours, tendant l’oreille, d’y découvrir une mélodie ; mais l’idée de Non-coopération, avec son formidable volume sonore, sa menace agglomérée, ses clameurs de négation, ne me chante rien. Et je me dis : « Si vous ne pouvez marcher du même pas que vos compatriotes, en cette grande crise de leur hist
U||oire, gardez-vous de dire qu’ils ont tort et que vous avez raison ; mais abandonnez votre rôle de soldat, retournez dans votre coin de poète, et soyez prêt à accepter la dérision et la disgrâce populaire ! »[116]
U||[116] 5 mars 1921.
U||Ainsi parlerait un Gœthe — Gœthe Bacchus indien. Et il semble que, désormais, tout soit dit : le Poète prend congé de l’Action, qui nie ; et il tisse autour de lui l’enchantement créateur. — Mais Tagore ne s’y tient point. Comme il l’écrit, « le sort l’avait élu, pour diriger sa barque précisément contre le courant ! » Il n’était pas seulement le Poète ; il était, à ce moment de sa vie, l’ambassadeur spirituel de l’Asie en Europe ; et il venait demander à celle-ci son alliance pour l’Université mondiale qu’il voulait fonder à Santiniketan.
U||    « Quelle ironie du destin que je vienne de prêcher, de ce côté des mers, la coopération des cultures entre l’Orient et l’Occident, juste à l’heure où la Non-coopération se prêche de l’autre côté ! »[117]
U||[117] 5 mars 1921.
U||La Non-coopération le blessait directement, dans son action et dans sa foi intellectuelle : « Je crois en la vraie union de l’Orient et de l’Occident[118]. »
U||[118] Ibid.
U||Elle le blessait dans sa riche intelligence, nourrie de toutes les cultures du monde.
U||    « Toutes les gloires de l’humanité sont miennes… L’Infinie Personnalité de l’Homme (comme disent les Upanishads) ne peut être accomplie que dans une grandiose harmonie de toutes les races humaines… Ma prière est pour que l’Inde représente la coopération de tous les peuples du monde. Pour elle, l’Unité est la Vérité, et la division est Mâyâ. L’Unité est ce qui comprend tout, et par conséquent ne peut être atteinte par la voie de la négation… L’effort actuel pour séparer notre esprit de celui de l’Occident est une tentative de suicide spirituel… L’âge présent a été puissamment possédé par l’Occident. Ce n’a été possible que parce qu’à l’Occident est échue quelque grande mission pour l’homme. Nous, de l’Orient, nous avons à nous en instruire… C’est un mal sans doute que, depuis longtemps, nous n’ayons plus été en contact avec notre propre culture et que, par suite, la culture d’Occident ne soit pas placée à son véritable plan
U|| Mais dire qu’il est mal de rester en rapports avec elle, c’est encourager la pire forme de provincialisme, qui ne produit que l’indigence intellectuelle… Le problème d’aujourd’hui est mondial. Aucun peuple ne peut faire son salut, en se détachant des autres. Ou se sauver ensemble, ou disparaître ensemble. »[119]
U||[119] 13 mars 1921. — Repris et développé dans l’article : L’Union des cultures (Modern Review, novembre 1921).
U||Comme Gœthe en 1813 se refusant à haïr la civilisation française, Tagore ne peut donc admettre l’élimination de la civilisation d’Occident. Et bien que ce ne soit point le fond de la pensée de Gandhi, il sait que tel sera le sens que lui donneront les passions soulevées du nationalisme indien. Il redoute la venue de cette barbarie de l’esprit :
U||    « Les étudiants apportent leur offrande de sacrifice, à quoi ? Non pas à une éducation plus complète, mais à la Non-éducation… Je me souviens que, durant le premier mouvement Swadeshi[120], une foule de jeunes étudiants vinrent me voir ; ils me dirent que, si je leur commandais de quitter leurs écoles et leurs collèges, ils m’obéiraient sur-le-champ. Je refusai énergiquement, et ils s’en allèrent irrités, doutant de la sincérité de mon amour pour ma mère-patrie. »[121]
U||[120] Le premier mouvement de Home Rule indien, provoqué en 1907-1908 par la division du Bengale.
U||[121] 5 mars 1921.
U||Or, précisément en ces jours de printemps 1921 où Tagore apprenait avec déplaisir qu’on venait de boycotter dans l’Inde les études anglaises, il avait, à Londres même, un exemple agressif de ce nationalisme intellectuel ; à la conférence d’un professeur anglais, qui était son ami, Pearson, des étudiants indiens se livrèrent à des manifestations inconvenantes. Tagore s’indigne. Dans une lettre au directeur de Santiniketan, il flétrit cet esprit d’intolérance mesquine. Il en rend responsable le mouvement de Non-coopération. — Gandhi répond à ces blâmes[122]. Tout en faisant ses réserves sur la valeur morale de l’éducation littéraire d’Europe, qui n’a rien de commun avec celle du caractère, et qu’il accuse d’avoir dévirilisé la jeunesse de l’Inde, il condamne les brutalités commises, et proteste de sa liberté d’esprit :
U||[122] The Poet’s Anxiety, 1er juin 1921.
U||    « Je ne tiens pas à ce que ma maison soit bloquée de tous les côtés et à ce que mes fenêtres soient bouchées. Je tiens à ce que le souffle des cultures de tous les pays circule librement à travers ma demeure, mais je me refuse à me laisser emporter par lui. Ma religion n’est pas une religion de prison. Elle a une place pour la moindre créature de Dieu. Elle est fermée à l’insolent orgueil de race, de religion et de couleur. »
U||Ce sont de nobles paroles. Elles ne désarment pas l’inquiétude de Tagore. Il ne doute point de Gandhi. Mais il craint les Gandhistes. Et, dès ses premiers pas dans l’Inde, après son débarquement, en août 1921, il est suffoqué par leur croyance aveugle aux affirmations du maître. Il voit proche la menace d’un despotisme mental ; et, dans sa Modern Review, il publie, le 1er octobre, un véritable manifeste : L’Appel de la Vérité, qui s’élève contre cette mentalité d’esclaves. La protestation est d’autant plus frappante qu’elle est précédée d’un splendide hommage à la personne du Mahâtmâ. Tagore, rappelant les débuts du mouvement d’émancipation de l’Inde, en 1907-1908, dit que la vision des chefs politiques indiens était restée livresque ; elle s’inspirait des ombres de Burke, Gladstone, Mazzini, Garibaldi, et se montra incapable de dépasser l’élite, qui parlait anglais.
U||    « A ce moment est venu Mahâtmâ Gandhi. Il s’est tenu sur le seuil de la chaumière des milliers de déshérités, vêtu comme un d’eux. Il leur parlait dans leur propre langue. Là enfin était la vérité, non une citation d’un livre. Aussi, le nom de Mahâtmâ qui lui a été donné est son vrai nom. Qui d’autre a senti que tous les hommes de l’Inde étaient sa chair et son sang ? Au contact de la vérité, les forces comprimées de l’âme se sont révélées. Aussitôt que le vrai Amour s’est tenu à la porte de l’Inde, la porte s’est ouverte toute grande. Toute hésitation s’est évanouie. La vérité a éveillé la vérité… Honneur au Mahâtmâ qui a rendu visible la puissance de la vérité !… Ainsi, quand Buddha fit entendre la vérité de la Compassion pour tous les êtres vivants, qu’il avait obtenue comme fruit de sa discipline de soi, l’Inde s’est éveillée dans la fleur de sa virilité ; sa force s’est répandue en sciences, en arts et en richesses
U|| ; elle a débordé par delà océans et déserts… Nulle exploitation commerciale ou militaire n’a jamais rien fait de pareil… L’Amour seul est le vrai. Quand il donne la liberté, il l’installe au centre de nous-mêmes. »
U||Mais cette apothéose, brusquement, s’interrompt. La déception la suit.
U||    « Quelques notes de la musique de ce merveilleux réveil de l’Inde par l’amour ont flotté jusqu’à moi à travers les mers… Dans l’attente de respirer la fluide brise de la liberté nouvelle, je suis revenu plein de joie. Mais ce que j’ai trouvé, en arrivant, m’a abattu. Une atmosphère oppressante pesait sur le pays. Je ne sais quelle pression extérieure semblait pousser chacun et tous à parler sur le même ton, à s’atteler à la même meule. Ce que j’ai entendu partout, c’était que la raison et la culture devaient être mises sous clef ; il n’était plus nécessaire que de s’accrocher à l’obéissance aveugle. Tant il est aisé d’écraser, au nom de la liberté extérieure, la liberté intérieure de l’homme ! »
U||Nous connaissons cette angoisse et cette protestation. Elles sont de tous les temps. Les derniers esprits libres du monde antique finissant les ont fait entendre, en face du monde chrétien qui venait. En face des marées humaines, que soulève aujourd’hui le flux aveugle d’une foi, sociale ou nationale, nous sentons monter en nous cette opposition. C’est l’éternelle révolte de l’âme libre contre les âges de foi, qu’elle-même a suscités : car la foi — pour une poignée d’élus, infinie liberté — est, pour les peuples qui l’acclament, un esclavage de plus.
U||Mais le blâme de Tagore porte au delà du fanatisme des foules. Par-dessus les masses d’hommes ivres d’obéissance, il atteint le Mahâtmâ. Si grand que soit Gandhi, l’autorité qu’il assume ne dépasse-t-elle pas les forces d’un seul homme ? Une cause comme celle de l’Inde ne peut être remise aux mains d’un maître. Le Mahâtmâ est le Maître de la vérité et de l’amour. Et certes, « la verge d’or qui peut éveiller notre pays à la vérité et à l’amour n’est pas de ces objets qui puissent être fabriqués par l’orfèvre d’à côté… Mais la science et l’art d’édifier le Swarâj (Home Rule) est un vaste sujet. Ses sentiers sont difficiles et demandent du temps. Pour une tâche pareille, l’élan et l’émotion sont indispensables, mais non moins l’étude et la pensée. Pour elle, l’économiste doit méditer, l’ouvrier œuvrer, l’éducateur enseigner, l’homme d’État s’ingénier. En un mot, la force morale du pays doit s’exercer dans toutes les d
U||irections. Il faut conserver partout l’esprit de recherche, intact et sans entraves. L’intelligence ne doit pas être rendue timide, par une pression ouverte ou cachée. »
U||Tagore fait donc appel à la coopération de toutes les forces libres de l’Inde.
U||    « Dans nos antiques forêts, nos gurus (sages), dans la plénitude de leur vision, lançaient l’Appel à tous les chercheurs de la vérité… Pourquoi notre guru, qui veut nous conduire sur les chemins de l’action, ne lance-t-il pas aussi l’Appel ? »
U||Mais le guru Gandhi n’a lancé que cet unique appel, à chacun et à tous : « Filez et tissez ! »
U||    « Est-ce là cet Appel de l’âge nouveau à la création nouvelle ? Si les grandes machines sont un danger pour l’esprit d’Occident, les petites machines ne sont-elles pas pour nous un danger pire ? »
U||Ce ne serait même pas assez que toutes les forces de la nation coopérassent entre elles, il faut qu’elles coopèrent avec celles de l’univers. « Le réveil de l’Inde est lié au réveil du monde… Dorénavant, toute nation qui s’enfermera en soi ira contre l’esprit de l’âge nouveau. » Et Tagore, qui vient de passer plusieurs années en Europe, évoque le souvenir des hommes qu’il a rencontrés là-bas, de ces bons Européens qui ont libéré leur cœur des chaînes du nationalisme pour le vouer au service de toute l’humanité, — cette minorité persécutée des citoyens de l’univers, — cives totius orbis, — qu’il classe parmi les Sannyasins[123] « ceux qui ont dans leur âme réalisé l’Unité humaine… »
U||[123] C’est-à-dire, ceux qui en ont fini avec leur vie personnelle, afin d’apporter l’Unité à l’Homme.
U||    « Et nous, nous resterions seuls à nous contenter de réciter le chapelet de la Négation, de revenir sans cesse sur les fautes d’autrui, de poursuivre l’édification du Swarâj sur des fondations de haines !… Quand l’oiseau est ranimé par l’aube, tout son réveil n’est pas absorbé par la recherche de la nourriture. Ses ailes répondent inlassablement à l’appel des cieux. Son gosier verse des chants de joie à la lumière nouvelle. L’humanité nouvelle nous a envoyé son appel. Que notre esprit réponde en son propre langage !… Notre premier devoir, à l’aube, est de nous rappeler Celui qui est Un, qui est sans distinction de classes et de couleurs, et qui, par ses forces variées, pourvoit, comme il est nécessaire, aux besoins de chaque classe et de toutes les classes. Prions Celui qui donne la sagesse de nous unir tous, en une juste compréhension ! »[124]
U||[124] Paraphrase de la première stance des Upanishads.
U||Cette royale parole, une des plus hautes qu’un peuple ait entendues, ce poème ensoleillé domine toutes les mêlées humaines. Et la seule critique qu’on puisse en faire, c’est qu’il les domine trop. Il a raison, du haut des siècles. L’oiseau-poète, l’alouette de grandeur d’aigle, (comme disait Heine d’un géant de notre musique), chante sur les ruines du Temps. Il vit dans l’éternel. Mais le présent est pressant. L’heure qui passe veut à ses âpres souffrances un soulagement immédiat, imparfait — mais coûte que coûte ! Et sur ce point, Gandhi, qui manque des envolées de Tagore (ou, qui peut-être, Bôdhisattva de la Pitié, y a renoncé pour vivre avec les déshérités), a beau jeu pour répondre.
U||Il le fait, cette fois, avec plus de passion qu’il n’en avait montré dans cette noble joûte. Sa réponse ne tarde point ; elle paraît, le 13 octobre, dans Young India, et elle est pathétique. Gandhi remercie la grande sentinelle[125] de mettre l’Inde en garde contre certains dangers. Il est d’accord avec lui sur la nécessité du libre jugement :
U||[125] The great sentinel, titre de l’article du 13 octobre 1921.
U||    « On ne doit donner sa raison à garder à personne. L’abandon aveugle est souvent plus nuisible que la soumission forcée au fouet du tyran. Il y a encore de l’espoir pour l’esclave de la brute ; il n’y en pas pour celui de l’amour. »
U||Tagore est un bon veilleur qui avertit de l’approche d’ennemis qui se nomment : bigoterie, léthargie, intolérance, ignorance, inertie. Mais Gandhi n’admet point que les reproches de Tagore soient justifiés. Le Mahâtmâ s’adresse toujours à la raison. Et il n’est point vrai qu’il y ait dans l’Inde une obéissance aveugle. Si le pays s’est décidé pour l’emploi du rouet, ç’a été après une lente et laborieuse réflexion. Tagore parle de patience et se satisfait de beaux chants. C’est la guerre ! Que le poète pose sa lyre ! Il chantera, après. « Quand une maison est en feu, chacun prend un seau pour éteindre l’incendie… »
U||    « Quand ceux qui m’entourent meurent, faute d’aliments, la seule occupation qui me soit permise est de nourrir les affamés… L’Inde est une maison en feu… L’Inde meurt de faim, parce qu’elle n’a pas de travail qui lui permette de trouver la nourriture. Khulna meurt de faim… Les Ceded Districts passent par une quatrième famine. Orissa souffre de famine chronique… L’Inde devient chaque jour plus exténuée. Dans ses membres, le sang ne circule presque plus. Si nous n’y avisons, elle va s’écrouler… Pour un peuple affamé et inactif, la seule forme sous laquelle Dieu puisse oser apparaître, c’est le Travail et la promesse de manger, en paiement. Dieu a créé l’homme pour qu’il gagnât sa nourriture par son travail, et il a dit que ceux qui mangent sans travailler sont des voleurs… Pensons aux millions d’êtres humains qui sont aujourd’hui moins que des animaux, qui sont presque à la mort ! Le rouet est la vie pour les millions de moribonds. C’est la faim qu
U||i pousse l’Inde au rouet… Le Poète vit pour le lendemain et voudrait que nous fissions de même. Il présente à nos regards extasiés la belle peinture des oiseaux, de bon matin chantant des hymnes de louanges, ou prenant leur essor. Ces oiseaux sont nourris. Ils ont leur aliment quotidien, et ils prennent leur essor avec des ailes reposées, dont le sang s’est renouvelé pendant la nuit. Mais j’ai eu la douleur d’observer des oiseaux qui, faute de forces, n’avaient même plus le désir d’agiter faiblement leurs ailes. L’oiseau humain, sous le ciel indien, se lève plus faible que lorsqu’il a fait semblant de se reposer. Pour des millions d’êtres, la vie est une veille éternelle, ou une catalepsie éternelle… J’ai trouvé impossible d’adoucir la souffrance des affamés avec un chant de Kabir… Donnez-leur du travail, afin qu’ils puissent manger !… Mais pourquoi, demande-t-on, moi qui n’ai pas besoin de travailler pour manger, filerais-je ? Parce que je mange ce qui ne
U|| m’appartient pas. Je vis de la spoliation de mes compatriotes. Suivez à la trace toutes les pièces de monnaie qui arrivent dans votre poche, et vous verrez la vérité de ce que je dis… Il faut filer. Que chacun file ! Que Tagore file, comme les autres ! Et qu’il brûle ses vêtements étrangers !… C’est le devoir d’aujourd’hui. Dieu s’occupera de demain. Comme dit la Gîtâ : Accomplis l’action juste ! »
U||Sombres et tragiques paroles ! C’est la misère du monde qui se dresse devant le rêve de l’art, et lui crie : « Ose me nier ! » Qui ne comprend l’émotion passionnée de Gandhi et ne la partagerait !
U||Et pourtant, il y a dans cette réponse, si fière et si poignante, de quoi légitimer certaines craintes de Tagore : un Sileat poeta, rappel impérieux à la discipline du combat. Obéir sans discussion à la loi du Swadeshi, dont la première obligation quotidienne pour tous est l’emploi du rouet.
U||Dans la bataille humaine, sans doute, la discipline est un devoir. Mais le malheur est que ceux qui sont chargés de l’appliquer — les lieutenants du maître — soient le plus souvent des esprits étriqués : ils se font et font aux autres un idéal de ce qui n’est qu’un moyen pour l’atteindre ; la règle les fascine, par son étroitesse même, car ils ne se trouvent bien que dans la voie étroite. Pour eux, le Swadeshi devient un impératif. Il prend un caractère sacré. Un des principaux disciples de Gandhi, professeur à cette école la plus chère à son cœur : le Satyâgrahâshram de Sabarmati, à Ahmedabad, D. B. Kalelkar, publie L’Évangile du Swadeshi[126], en tête duquel Gandhi met son Approbation. Cette brochure s’adresse au public populaire. Voyons donc le Credo qui est appris au peuple par un de ceux qui sont à la source de la pure doctrine :
U||[126] The Gospel of Swadeshi. 1922, Madras.
U||    « Dieu s’incarne, d’âge en âge, pour la rédemption du monde… Mais ce n’est pas une règle invariable qu’il apparaisse sous la forme d’un être humain… Il le peut aussi bien sous la forme d’un principe abstrait ou d’une grande idée qui pénètre le monde… Le nouvel avatar est l’Évangile du Swadeshi. »
U||L’Évangéliste convient qu’on peut sourire de cette affirmation, si l’on ne voit dans le Swadeshi qu’une question de boycott de tissus étrangers. Mais cette question n’est qu’une minuscule application pratique d’un vaste « principe religieux, destiné à débarrasser le monde entier de ses dissensions haineuses et à émanciper l’humanité. » Son essence est contenue dans les Saintes Écritures hindoues. La voici :
U||« Ton propre Dharma[127], quoique vide de mérites, est le meilleur. L’accomplissement d’un Dharma qui ne serait pas le tien est toujours entouré de dangers. Seul atteint au bonheur, qui se concentre sur son propre devoir. »
U||[127] Destin religieux.
U||Cette loi fondamentale du Swadeshi s’appuie sur la foi en « un Dieu qui a pourvu pour l’éternité au bonheur de l’univers. Ce Dieu a donné à chacun des êtres humains le milieu qui lui convient, pour accomplir sa tâche spéciale. Toutes les actions de l’homme doivent se conformer à sa situation propre dans sa vie… Pas plus que notre naissance, ou notre famille, ou notre pays, notre culture ne peut être choisie par nous ; nous n’avons qu’à accepter ce qui nous a été donné par Dieu, nous sommes tenus d’accepter nos traditions, comme venant de Dieu, et notre strict devoir est de nous y conformer. Les renier serait péché. »
U||De ces articles de foi, il suit que l’homme d’un pays n’a pas à s’occuper des autres pays.
U||    « Le dévot du Swadeshi ne prend jamais sur lui la tâche vaine d’essayer de réformer le monde, car il croit que le monde s’est mû et se mouvra toujours selon les plans fixés par Dieu… On ne doit pas s’attendre à ce que le peuple d’un pays pourvoie aux besoins d’un autre pays, même pour des motifs philanthropiques ; et si c’était possible, ce ne serait pas désirable… Le vrai dévot du Swadeshi n’oublie pas que tout être humain est son frère, mais il est tenu de faire la tâche qui lui est dévolue par sa naissance… De même que nous sommes tenus de servir le siècle où nous sommes nés, de même nous devons servir à tout prix la terre natale… L’émancipation de notre âme doit être cherchée par le moyen de notre propre religion et de notre propre culture. »
U||Est-il permis du moins à un peuple de développer tous les moyens qu’il a de s’accroître, son commerce, ses industries ? Nullement. Désir indigne, de vouloir doter l’Inde de grandes manufactures ! Ce serait faire violer à d’autres hommes leur Dharma. Et il est aussi criminel d’exporter ses produits que d’importer ceux des autres. Car « le prosélytisme répugne au principe du Swadeshi ». Et la conséquence logique (bien qu’inattendue pour un Européen) de cette loi est qu’il ne faut pas plus exporter ses produits que ses idées. Si l’Inde a été durement abaissée dans l’histoire, c’est en expiation du crime lointain des ancêtres qui commercèrent avec l’Égypte et avec Rome, crime répété par toutes les générations qui suivirent ces errements, sans s’amender. Que chaque pays, chaque classe s’en tienne à sa propre tâche, vive de ses propres ressources et de ses traditions !
U||    « Évitons d’être intimes avec ceux dont les usages sociaux sont différents des nôtres. On ne doit pas entrelacer sa vie avec celle des hommes ou des peuples, dont l’idéal est en désaccord avec le nôtre… Chaque homme est un ruisseau. Chaque peuple est un fleuve. Ils doivent suivre leur lit, limpides et sans souillure, jusqu’à ce qu’ils aient atteint la mer du Salut, où ils se mêleront tous. »
U||C’est le triomphe du Nationalisme. Le plus pur. Le plus étroit. Rester chez soi. Fermer toutes les portes. Ne rien changer. Tout conserver. Ne rien vendre au dehors. Ne rien acheter. Se purifier. Un Évangile médiéval de moines cloîtrés[128]. Et Gandhi, au cœur large, y laisse attacher son nom !
U||[128] Ça et là d’ailleurs, d’admirables prescriptions morales : Point de vengeances ! « Ce qui est passé est passé. Le passé est irrévocable, il est devenu une partie de l’éternité, et l’homme n’a plus aucun recours contre lui. Ne songe pas à des représailles pour les injustices et les offenses passées ! Que le passé mort enterre ses morts ! Dans le présent qui vit, agissons en prenant pour guides notre cœur et Dieu ! » — D’un bout à l’autre du livre une pureté de glacier.
U||On comprend le saisissement de Tagore, devant ces illuminés du nationalisme réactionnaire, qui prétendent arrêter le cours des siècles, mettre en cage l’essor de l’esprit, et couper tous les ponts avec l’Occident[129]. A la vérité, ce n’est point la vraie pensée de Gandhi. Il écrit en propres termes à Tagore : « Le Swadeshi est un message au monde. » (Donc il tient compte du monde, et il ne répudie pas le « prosélytisme »). « La Non-coopération n’est pas dirigée contre l’Occident. Elle est contre la civilisation matérielle et contre l’exploitation des faibles qui en résulte. » (Donc, elle ne combat que les erreurs de l’Occident et travaille pour le bien même de l’Occident). « C’est une retraite en nous-mêmes », (mais une retraite provisoire, pour rassembler nos forces, avant de les mettre au service de l’humanité). « L’Inde doit apprendre à vivre, avant d’apprendre à mourir pour l’humanité… » Et Gandhi ne refuse nullement la co
U||opération des Européens, à condition qu’ils se conforment à l’idéal salutaire qu’il offre à tous les hommes.
U||[129] Tagore devait être d’autant plus sensible à des écrits comme celui-ci qu’entre l’Ashram de Gandhi (d’où est issu cet Évangile) et Santiniketan de Tagore, s’était instituée une rivalité, que les deux chefs s’efforçaient d’éviter. On le voit par un article du 9 février 1922, dans Young India : Gandhi s’y plaint de paroles qu’un journaliste lui a attribuées au sujet de l’Ashram, et qui ont un caractère désobligeant pour Santiniketan. Il proteste de son respect pour la maison de Tagore, — non sans quelque humour voilé : « S’il me fallait décider de la supériorité de l’un ou de l’autre, dit-il, en dépit de la discipline et du lever matinal à l’Ashram, je vote pour Santiniketan. Il est le frère aîné, beaucoup plus vieux d’âge, et aussi de sagesse ». Mais, ajoute-t-il malicieusement, « que les habitants de Santiniketan prennent garde à la course du petit Ashram ! »
U||Cette vraie pensée de Gandhi est infiniment plus large, plus humaine, plus universaliste[130] que celle de l’Évangile publié sous son égide. Pourquoi donc y a-t-il donné son nom ? Pourquoi laisse-t-il enfermer son grandiose idéal, qui s’offre à toute la terre, dans les limites étroites d’une théocratie indienne ? Redoutables disciples ! Plus ils sont purs, et plus ils sont funestes. Dieu préserve un grand homme de ces amis qui ne saisissent qu’une partie de sa pensée ! En la codifiant, ils détruisent l’harmonie, qui est le principal bienfait de son âme vivante !
U||[130] A mon sens, Gandhi est aussi universaliste que Tagore, d’une autre façon. Il l’est par la conscience morale, Tagore par l’intelligence. Gandhi n’exclut personne de la communion de la prière et du travail quotidien. Ainsi, l’apôtre des premiers temps ne distinguait pas entre juifs et gentils ; mais à tous il imposait la même discipline morale. C’est ce que veut Gandhi. Mais là justement est son étroitesse : non dans le cœur, qui est aussi large que celui d’un Christ, mais dans l’esprit d’ascétisme intellectuel et de dépouillement. (Et cela aussi est du Christ !) Gandhi est un universaliste médiéval. Tout en le vénérant, nous sommes avec Tagore.
U||Ce n’est pas tout. Ceux-ci, du moins, qui vivent tout près du maître, ses disciples directs, restent encore teintés de sa noblesse morale. Mais ceux qui sont les disciples des disciples, — et les autres, les peuples à qui n’arrivent que des échos déformés, que retiendront-ils de sa doctrine de purification intérieure et d’abnégation créatrice ? Le plus extérieur, le plus matériel : une attente messianique du Swarâj (Home Rule) par le rouet ! La négation du progrès. Le fuori Barbari ! Tagore s’alarme, non sans raison, de la violence que les apôtres de la Non-violence (et Gandhi lui-même n’en est pas exempt) témoignent à l’égard, non des hommes, mais des choses d’Occident. Gandhi a bien soin de dire qu’« il se retirerait de la lutte, s’il y sentait de la haine contre les Anglais », qu’on doit aimer ceux que l’on combat, qu’il faut haïr leurs injustices, « haïr le Satanisme tout en aimant Satan ». Mais c’est un jeu bien subtil pour l’esprit p
U||opulaire. Lorsqu’à chaque Congrès, les chefs du mouvement rappellent passionnément les crimes des Anglais et leur déloyauté, les massacres du Punjab et le Khilafat, les colères s’amassent derrière l’écluse, et malheur lorsque l’écluse craquera ! Lorsque Gandhi préside au bûcher des étoffes précieuses à Bombay, en août 1921, et répond aux adjurations éplorées d’Andrews, l’ami de Tagore, par son Éthique de la Destruction[131], il croit qu’« il transfère la rancune du peuple des hommes sur les choses ». Mais il ne s’aperçoit pas que la rancune du peuple se fait la main, et qu’elle pense : « Les choses, d’abord ! Ensuite, les hommes ! » Et il ne prévoit pas qu’en ce même Bombay, moins de trois mois après, le peuple tuera les hommes. Il est trop saint, trop pur, trop dénué des passions animales qui sont tapies dans l’homme. Il ne songe pas assez qu’elles sont là, qui l’écoutent et happent ses paroles. Tagore, plus clairvoyant, remarque l’
U||imprudence des non-coopérateurs, qui, en toute innocence, rappelant sans relâche les torts commis par l’Europe, professent la non-violence, en inoculant à l’esprit populaire le virus de la fièvre qui amènera la violence. Ils ne s’en doutent pas, les apôtres qui ne sentent point la violence en leurs cœurs ! Mais qui touche à l’action doit écouter les cœurs des autres, et non pas le sien. Gare au peuple ! Cave canem ! Pour le tenir en laisse, les injonctions morales d’un Gandhi ne suffiront pas. Une seule chance peut-être, pour qu’ils obéissent sans broncher à l’austère discipline du maître : c’est que ce maître consente à être un Dieu, comme l’en sollicitent secrètement ceux qui le représentent déjà en Shri-Krishna. Mais la sincérité de Gandhi et son humilité s’y refusent.
U||[131] 1er septembre 1921.
U||Alors, il ne reste plus que la voix isolée du plus pur des hommes qui plane sur les grondements d’un océan humain. Combien de temps encore réussira-t-elle à s’en faire entendre ? Grandiose et tragique attente !
U||IV
U||Toute l’année 1921, où l’action s’accélère, est pleine d’incertitudes et de cahots violents. Gandhi n’échappe pas à leurs oscillations.
U||La révolte fermentait, et les répressions brutales du gouvernement en précipitaient le rythme. Des émeutes sanglantes éclatent à Malegaon, dans le district de Nasik, des troubles à Giridih, en Behar. Au début de mai 1921, des scènes plus graves en Assam : douze mille coolies, abandonnant leur travail aux plantations de thé, sont attaqués dans leur exode par des Gourkhas, au service du gouvernement. Les employés des chemins de fer et des paquebots, au Bengale oriental, font une grève complète de deux mois, par protestation. Gandhi s’efforce encore de jouer un rôle de conciliateur ; il a, au mois de mai, une longue entrevue avec le vice-roi, lord Reading ; il lui offre sa médiation auprès des frères Ali, accusés de discours poussant à la violence ; il obtient de ses amis musulmans la déclaration formelle qu’ils ne feront jamais appel à la violence.
U||Mais la vigueur du mouvement n’en est pas diminuée ; et l’élément musulman de l’Inde continue de prendre les initiatives les plus hardies. Le 8 juillet, à Karachi, la Conférence du Khilafat de toute l’Inde réitère les réclamations de l’Islam, déclare « illégal pour un musulman de servir dans l’armée ou d’aider au recrutement », et menace le gouvernement anglais, s’il combat le gouvernement d’Angora, de proclamer, à la session de fin d’année du Congrès de toute l’Inde, la Désobéissance Civile et la République Indienne. — Le 28 juillet, le Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde, réuni à Bombay, (premier Comité élu d’après la Constitution nouvelle), édicte que le devoir de tous est de boycotter le prince de Galles, dont la venue est prochaine, — décide le boycott complet de tous les tissus étrangers avant le 30 septembre, — encourage et réglemente le filage et le tissage nationaux, stimule la campagne contre les boissons, malgré le gouvernement qui
U|| protège les débitants. Mais, plus prudent que les musulmans du Khilafat, il blâme les troubles et déconseille, pour l’instant, la désobéissance civile, en même temps qu’il étend la propagande de non-violence.
U||En août, se déchaîne une brutale émeute des Moplahs, qui dure plusieurs mois. Gandhi, avec Maulana Mohamed Ali, veut aller de Calcutta à Malabar, pour la pacifier. Le gouvernement ne le permet pas, et fait arrêter, en septembre, Maulana Mohamed, son frère Maulana Shaukat Ali, et plusieurs notables musulmans, pour les propositions de désobéissance civile, votées à la Conférence du Khilafat. Sur-le-champ, le Comité Central du Khilafat, à Delhi, répète la résolution du Khilafat, qu’affirment énergiquement des centaines de meetings. Le 4 octobre, Gandhi se déclare solidaire de ses frères musulmans. Avec cinquante membres éminents du Congrès, il publie un manifeste, qui revendique le droit pour tout citoyen d’exprimer son opinion sur la non-participation au gouvernement, affirme qu’il est inconvenant pour tout Indien de servir, soit comme fonctionnaire civil, soit comme soldat, un gouvernement qui a causé la dégradation morale, économique et politique de l’Inde, et proclame le dev
U||oir pour chacun de s’en séparer. — Le procès des frères Ali a lieu à Karachi. Ils sont condamnés, avec leurs co-accusés, à deux ans d’emprisonnement rigoureux. L’Inde riposte, avec une vigueur accrue. Le manifeste de Gandhi est entériné, le 4 novembre, par le Comité du Congrès de toute l’Inde, à Delhi. Le Comité fait le pas décisif ; il autorise chaque province, sous sa responsabilité propre, à entreprendre la Désobéissance civile, jusqu’à et y compris le refus de paiement des taxes. Il pose comme conditions que les Résistants doivent avoir fait acte d’adhésion absolue au programme du Swadeshi et de la Non-coopération, y compris le filage à la main et l’engagement essentiel de Non-violence. — Il tâche ainsi, sous la direction de Gandhi, de concilier la révolte avec la discipline et la loi du sacrifice. Pour bien souligner celle-ci, il avertit les Résistants civils et leurs familles qu’ils n’aient pas à compter sur l’aide pécuniaire du Congrès.
U||La grande Désobéissance allait commencer, quand, le 17 novembre, le prince de Galles débarqua à Bombay. L’ordre de boycott fut exécuté par les classes moyennes et inférieures. Les riches, les Parsis, les personnalités officielles, n’en tinrent pas compte. La populace les malmena, sans épargner les femmes ; et l’émeute rapidement s’étendit ; il y eut des maisons saccagées, des blessés et des tués. Ce fut la seule explosion brutale, dans toute l’Inde, où le Hartal prescrit (la grève solennelle) fut religieusement accompli, en paix, sans incidents. Mais Gandhi en fut, comme il dit, « transpercé par une flèche ». A la première nouvelle des troubles, il accourut sur les lieux, où les émeutiers l’acclamèrent : sa honte en redoubla. Il apostropha durement la foule, et lui enjoignit de se disperser. Il dit que les Parsis avaient le droit de fêter le prince s’ils voulaient, et que rien ne pouvait excuser les indignes violences. La foule se tut ; mais plus loin, les tro
U||ubles se rallumèrent. Les pires éléments étaient sortis de terre ; vingt mille hommes soulevés ne se laissent pas sur-le-champ remettre à la raison. L’émeute toutefois resta limitée ; la moindre de nos journées révolutionnaires d’Europe laisse plus de dégâts. Gandhi lança aux citoyens de Bombay et aux non-coopérateurs des appels désolés, que reproduisit la presse. Il déclarait que de pareilles scènes rendaient impossible actuellement la Désobéissance civile en masse, et il en suspendit l’ordre. Pour se punir lui-même des violences des autres, il s’imposait un jeûne religieux de cinq jours[132]. Les Européens de l’Inde avaient été moins alarmés encore des troubles de Bombay que de la saisissante unanimité du Hartal silencieux dans toute l’étendue de l’Inde. Ils pressèrent le vice-roi d’agir. Une série de mesures violentes, qui ne respectaient pas la légalité, furent prises par les gouvernements des provinces. On ressortit une vieille loi de 1908 contre les a
U||narchistes et les sociétés secrètes ; on l’utilisa contre les associations de volontaires du Congrès et du Khilafat. Des milliers d’arrestations furent faites. En réplique, des milliers de volontaires nouveaux s’inscrivirent sur des listes publiques. Les Comités des provinces eurent ordre d’organiser les troupes de volontaires et de leur imposer une discipline uniforme. Un Hartal fut décidé pour le 24 décembre, jour de la visite du prince à Calcutta. Et le jour dit, le prince traversa Calcutta désert.
U||[132] Le jeûne de 24 heures par semaine est régulier chez Gandhi.
U||En ces heures qui semblaient couver la Révolution, s’ouvrit à Ahmedabad le Congrès national de toute l’Inde. Il eut la solennité émouvante des États généraux de 1789. Le président venait d’être incarcéré. Les discussions furent brèves. Le Congrès réaffirma la doctrine de Non-coopération, convia tous les citoyens à s’offrir comme « volontaires », afin d’être arrêtés, invita le peuple de l’Inde à former partout des meetings, proclama sa foi dans la Désobéissance civile, égale en force et supérieure en humanité à la rébellion armée ; et il conseilla de l’organiser, aussitôt que la masse serait suffisamment initiée aux méthodes de Non-violence. Prévoyant que la plupart de ses membres seraient arrêtés, à l’issue de la session, le Congrès délégua à Gandhi tous ses pouvoirs, la dictature de fait, avec la faculté de choisir son successeur ; il le laissait seul maître de la politique indienne, sous l’unique réserve de ne pas modifier le Credo nati
U||onal et de ne pas conclure de paix avec le gouvernement, sans l’assentiment du Comité du Congrès. Une fraction de l’Assemblée avait déposé une motion qui tendait à l’action violente, pour établir au plus tôt l’indépendance complète de l’Inde. La majorité la rejeta, s’en tenant aux principes de Gandhi.
U||Les semaines qui suivirent manifestèrent l’enthousiasme religieux qui s’était emparé de l’Inde. 40.000 hommes et femmes s’offrirent joyeusement à la prison.
U||Derrière eux, des milliers d’autres se levaient, attendant leur tour d’affirmer leur conviction. Une nouvelle fois, Gandhi s’apprêta à lancer l’ordre de la Désobéissance civile en masse. Le signal devait être donné par un pays modèle, où sa pensée avait toujours trouvé une terre d’élection, Bardoli, dans la province de Bombay[133]. Gandhi l’annonce au vice-roi par une lettre publique du 9 février 1922, qui est une courtoise, mais nette déclaration de guerre. Il est, dit-il, le chef responsable du mouvement. Bardoli est la première unité de la révolte en masse de l’Inde contre le gouvernement, qui a brutalement attenté à la liberté de parole, d’association, et de la presse. Gandhi accorde sept jours à lord Reading, pour amender sa politique. Sinon, l’ordre est donné : la révolte commencera[134].
U||[133] 140 villages : 87.000 habitants.
U||[134] Une note du même jour, dans Young India, annonce à l’Inde cet ultimatum, avec plus d’énergie encore. Si le vice-roi ne répond point, l’ordre est irrévocable ; la Désobéissance civile doit être accomplie, à tout prix, quand bien même à présent la majorité se prononcerait contre.
U||La lettre au vice-roi venait à peine de partir, quand un drame plus sanglant que les précédents se produisit à Chauri-Chaura, dans le district de Gorakhpur. Au cours d’une procession, des policiers avaient attaqué la foule. Attaqués à leur tour, ils ouvrirent le feu et se réfugièrent dans la Thana[135]. La populace l’incendia. En vain, les assiégés demandèrent grâce, ils furent massacrés et brûlés. La provocation était venue d’eux ; et à leur meurtre aucun volontaire de la Non-coopération n’avait participé. Gandhi avait donc le droit d’en dégager sa responsabilité. Mais il était devenu vraiment la Conscience de l’Inde. Le crime d’un seul Indien l’ensanglantait. Il prenait sur lui tous les péchés de son peuple. — Son déchirement fut tel que, sur l’heure, il arrêta, pour la seconde fois, le mouvement qu’il venait de décréter. La situation était beaucoup plus pénible, cette fois, qu’après l’émeute de Bombay. Il avait, quelques jours avant, envoyé son
U|| ultimatum au vice-roi. Comment le retirer sans ridicule ? L’orgueil, « Satan » comme il dit, le lui défendait. C’était une raison de plus pour qu’il s’y décidât.
U||[135] Les bâtiments de police.
U||Le 16 février 1922, paraît dans Young India un des plus extraordinaires documents de cette vie[136], son Mea Culpa, sa Confession publique. Du fond de sa mortification, la première parole qui s’élève est de jubilation, pour remercier Dieu de l’avoir humilié :
U||[136] The Crime of Chauri-Chaura.
U||    « Dieu a abondé pour moi en bienveillance. (God has been abundantly kind to me). Pour la troisième fois, il m’a averti que l’Inde ne possédait pas encore cette atmosphère de Non-violence et de Vérité qui peut, et qui peut seule, justifier la Désobéissance civile en masse, — la seule digne d’être appelée civile, c’est-à-dire douce, humble, sage, volontaire et pourtant aimante, jamais criminelle et haineuse. Il m’avertit, pour la première fois en 1919, quand commença l’agitation contre l’Acte Rowlatt. Ahmedabad, Viramgam et Kheda ont erré. Amritsar et Kasur ont erré. Je suis revenu sur mes pas, j’ai appelé mon erreur une faute de calcul himalayenne, je me suis humilié devant Dieu et devant les hommes, j’ai arrêté non seulement la désobéissance civile en masse, mais la mienne… La deuxième fois, ce fut par les événements de Bombay. Dieu m’en fit le témoin oculaire… J’arrêtai la Désobéissance en masse, qui devait être commencée à Bardoli. L’humil
U||iation fut plus grande, mais elle m’a fait du bien. Je suis sûr que la nation a gagné par ce retard : ainsi, l’Inde est restée la représentante de la Vérité et de la Non-violence. Mais la plus amère humiliation est celle d’aujourd’hui… Dieu a parlé clairement par Chauri-Chaura… A l’heure où l’Inde prétend monter sur le trône de la liberté par la Non-violence, la violence de la populace est d’un triste augure… Il faut un contrôle des Non-coopérateurs sur la violence du pays. Ce ne sera possible que lorsque les hooligans (les hommes sans aveu) de l’Inde seront maîtrisés… »
U||Il a donc réuni, le 13 février, à Bardoli, le Comité d’action du Congrès, et il lui a exposé son trouble. Plusieurs de ses collègues n’ont pas été d’accord avec lui. Mais il a été « béni » du ciel, dit-il, pour avoir trouvé chez eux tant d’indulgence et de considération. Ils ont compris ses scrupules et consenti, sur ses instances, à suspendre la Désobéissance civile, en invitant toutes les organisations à créer une atmosphère de Non-violence.
U||    « Je sais, continue Gandhi, que cela semblera d’une politique peu sage ; mais cela est raisonnable selon la religion. Le pays aura gagné par mon humiliation et par la confession de mon erreur. La seule vertu à laquelle j’aspire, c’est la Vérité et la Non-violence. Je ne prétends nullement à des facultés surhumaines. Je n’y tiens point. Je porte la même chair corruptible que le plus faible, et je suis aussi exposé à l’erreur. Mes services ont bien des limitations ; mais Dieu jusqu’ici les a bénis, en dépit des imperfections… La confession de l’erreur est un coup de balai… Je me sens plus fort parce que je me suis confessé, et la cause doit gagner, du fait même de son recul. Jamais homme n’a atteint son but, en persistant à dévier du droit chemin… On m’objecte que le crime de Chauri-Chaura n’a rien à voir avec l’action projetée de Bardoli. Je n’en doute point. Le peuple de Bardoli est, à mon avis, le plus pacifique de l’Inde. Mais Bardoli n’est qu
U||’un point. Son effort ne peut réussir que s’il y a corrélation parfaite entre lui et les autres parties de l’Inde… Un grain d’arsenic dans un pot de lait l’empoisonne… Chauri-Chaura est un poison mortel… Il n’est pas unique et isolé. Il est un symptôme aggravé de violences populaires à l’état sporadique, çà et là répandues… La véritable Désobéissance civile ne comporte aucune excitation. Elle est une préparation à la souffrance muette. Son effet est merveilleux, quoique imperceptible et doux… La tragédie de Chauri-Chaura est le doigt indicateur sur notre route. Si nous ne voulons pas que la violence sorte de la non-violence, nous devons revenir en hâte sur nos pas, rétablir une atmosphère de calme, et ne pas songer à commencer la Désobéissance en masse, avant d’être certains que la paix sera conservée, en dépit de tout… Que l’adversaire nous accuse de lâcheté ! Mieux vaut être mal jugé que de trahir Dieu… »
U||Et l’apôtre veut expier le sang répandu par d’autres.
U||    « Je dois subir une purification personnelle. Je dois être en état d’enregistrer mieux la plus légère variation de l’atmosphère morale autour de moi[137]. Mes prières doivent avoir plus de vérité et d’humilité. Rien de purifiant comme le jeûne vrai, pour obtenir une expression de soi plus complète, une maîtrise de l’esprit sur la chair… »
U||[137] Que l’on note cette lumière jetée sur le pouvoir mystérieux de cette âme, où s’inscrivent les frémissements de son peuple !
U||Il décrète pour lui, publiquement, un jeûne continu de cinq jours. Que personne ne l’imite ! Il doit se châtier seul. Il a été un chirurgien maladroit. Il lui faut, ou abdiquer, ou acquérir une expérience plus ferme. Son jeûne est, à la fois, pénitence et châtiment, pour lui et pour ceux de Chauri-Chaura, qui ont péché, en ayant peut-être son nom sur les lèvres. Gandhi souhaiterait d’être seul à souffrir pour eux ; mais il leur conseille de se livrer au gouvernement et de faire des aveux. Car ils ont fait un mal terrible à la cause qu’ils voulaient servir.
U||    « Je voudrais souffrir toutes les humiliations, toutes les tortures, l’ostracisme absolu, et la mort même, pour empêcher notre mouvement de devenir violence ou précurseur de violence… »
U||L’histoire de la conscience humaine compte peu de pages aussi hautes. La valeur morale d’un tel acte est exceptionnelle. Mais comme acte politique, il était déconcertant. Gandhi reconnaissait lui-même qu’on pourrait le juger « politiquement absurde et peu sage ». Il est dangereux de bander tous les ressorts d’un peuple, de le faire haleter d’attente devant l’acte prescrit, de lever le bras pour l’ordre, et puis lorsque déjà s’ébranle la formidable machine, par trois fois de l’arrêter. On risque d’user les rouages et de casser l’élan.
U||Quand se réunit à Delhi, le 24 février 1922, le Comité du Congrès, ce ne fut pas sans une vive opposition que Gandhi put faire adopter les résolutions prises, le 13, à Bardoli. Une scission se manifesta parmi les Non-coopérateurs. Gandhi voulait qu’avant de se remettre en marche, on s’organisât plus sévèrement ; et il apportait un programme de construction. Mais beaucoup s’irritaient de ces lenteurs, ils protestaient contre la suspension de l’ordre de révolte et disaient qu’on étouffait la ferveur du pays. Un parti présenta un vote de censure contre le Comité d’action et demanda que ses ordres fussent annulés. Gandhi l’emporta pourtant. Mais il souffrit profondément. La majorité même qui le suivait ne lui fit pas illusion. Il ne la sentait pas sincère. Et plus d’un qui votait pour lui, derrière lui l’appelait « Dictateur ». Il se savait, au fond, en désaccord avec le pays. Il le dit, avec son intrépide franchise, le 2 mars 1922 :
U||    « Il y a dans la majorité tant de courants cachés de violence, conscients ou inconscients, que j’ai prié pour une défaite désastreuse. J’ai toujours été en minorité. Au Sud-Afrique, j’ai commencé avec l’unanimité, je suis descendu à une minorité de 64, et même de 16, et je suis remonté de nouveau à une énorme majorité. Le travail le meilleur et le plus solide a été fait dans le désert de la minorité… J’ai la peur de la majorité. Je suis écœuré de l’adoration de la multitude sans jugement. Je sentirais le terrain plus ferme sous mes pas, si elle crachait sur moi… Un ami m’a averti de ne pas exploiter ma dictature… Loin de l’avoir exploitée, je me demande si je ne me laisse pas moi-même « exploiter » ! J’avoue que j’en ai une terreur comme jamais avant. Mon seul salut est dans mon impudence. J’ai averti mes amis du Congrès que je suis incorrigible. Chaque fois que le peuple commettra des bévues, je continuerai à les confesser. Le seul tyr
U||an que je reconnaisse en ce monde est la « petite voix silencieuse » (the still small voice), qui est au-dedans de nous. Et même si je devais envisager une minorité d’un seul, j’aurais le courage d’être de cette minorité désespérée. C’est là pour moi le seul parti sincère. Je suis aujourd’hui un homme plus triste et, je le crois, plus sage. Je vois que notre Non-violence est à fleur de peau. Nous brûlons d’indignation. Le gouvernement l’alimente par ses actes insensés. On dirait presque qu’il désire voir ce pays couvert de meurtres, d’incendies et de rapines, afin de pouvoir prétendre qu’il est le seul capable de les réprimer. Notre Non-violence me paraît due à notre impuissance : comme si, dans nos cœurs, nous caressions le désir de nous venger, dès que nous en aurons l’occasion. Est-ce que la Non-violence volontaire peut sortir de cette Non-violence forcée des faibles ? N’est-ce pas une expérience vaine que je suis en train de tenter ?… Et si, quand
U|| la fureur éclatera, pas un ne restait indemne, si la main de chacun se levait contre son prochain, à quoi servirait-il alors que je jeûne à en mourir, après un tel désastre ?… Si vous n’êtes pas capables de la Non-violence, adoptez loyalement la violence ! Mais pas d’hypocrisie[138] ! La majorité prétend accepter la Non-violence… Qu’elle connaisse donc sa responsabilité ! Elle est tenue de retarder maintenant la Désobéissance civile et de faire d’abord œuvre constructive… Sinon, nous serons noyés dans des eaux dont nous ne soupçonnons pas les profondeurs… »
U||[138] Il était devenu clair pour Gandhi qu’une partie de sa majorité, qui soutenait la Non-violence, n’y voyait, secrètement, qu’un expédient politique, masquant la préparation à la violence. Ils parlaient doucereusement, dit Gandhi, de « donner des coups non-violents ! » Gandhi avait saisi l’équivoque dangereuse, que Tagore avait aperçue depuis longtemps. Et il en était suffoqué. Plus durement que Tagore, maintenant, il la dénonce et lui rompt en visière.
U||Et, se tournant vers la minorité, il lui disait :
U||    « Vous ne voulez pas de la Non-violence ? Sortez du Congrès ! Formez un nouveau parti ! Énoncez publiquement votre Credo ! Et que le pays choisisse entre nous !… Mais pas d’équivoques ! Soyez francs !… »
U||Il y a une amère tristesse, mais virile, dans ces fortes paroles. C’était la nuit du Jardin des Oliviers. Gandhi allait être arrêté… Qui sait si, dans le fond de son cœur, il n’accueillit point l’événement comme une délivrance ?…
U||Il s’y attendait depuis longtemps. Dès le 10 novembre 1920, toutes ses mesures étaient prises. Il avait dicté ses instructions au peuple, pour le jour où il ne serait plus là (If I am arrested). Il y revint, dans un nouvel article du 9 mars 1922, quand le bruit de son arrestation commença à se répandre. Il ne craint rien, dit-il, des violences du gouvernement. Il ne craint qu’une chose, les violences du peuple. Il en serait déshonoré. « Que le peuple considère le jour de mon arrestation comme un jour de réjouissance ! Le gouvernement croit que, Gandhi arrêté, on en aura fini avec l’Inde. Prouvez-lui le contraire ! Qu’il mesure la force du peuple ! » Le plus beau témoignage d’honneur que le peuple puisse lui rendre, c’est de garder une paix parfaite. Gandhi serait humilié de penser que le gouvernement hésite à l’arrêter, de peur d’un soulèvement sanglant. Donc, que le peuple reste calme, qu’il ne suspende point son travail, qu’il ne forme point de meetings
U||! Mais que les tribunaux se ferment, que les services du gouvernement soient abandonnés, que les écoles officielles soient désertées, que s’exécute en son intégralité, avec ordre et discipline, le programme de Non-coopération ! Si le peuple agit ainsi, il aura la victoire. Sinon, il sera écrasé.
U||Tout étant prêt, Gandhi se rendit dans sa chère retraite, Ashram de Sabarmati, près d’Ahmedabad, pour y attendre, dans le recueillement, au milieu des disciples aimés, l’arrivée de ceux qui allaient l’arrêter. Il aspirait à la prison. En son absence, la foi de l’Inde s’en manifesterait mieux. « Et lui, il trouverait un repos, que peut-être il méritait[139]… »
U||[139] 9 mars 1922.
U||Le soir du 10 mars, peu après la prière, les hommes de police arrivèrent. L’Ashram était averti de leur venue. Le Mahatma se remit dans leurs mains. Sur le chemin de la prison, il rencontra Maulana Hasrat Mohani, son ami mahométan, qui de loin était accouru, juste à temps pour l’embrasser. Il fut conduit à la geôle, avec le publisher[140] de Young India, Banker. Sa femme eut permission de l’accompagner jusqu’au seuil.
U||[140] C’est-à-dire l’imprimeur-éditeur.
U||Le samedi 18 mars, à midi, s’ouvrit le « grand procès[141] », devant le juge de district et sessions d’Ahmedabad. Il fut d’une rare noblesse. Le juge et l’accusé firent assaut de courtoisie chevaleresque. Jamais l’Angleterre ne s’éleva, dans la lutte, à une plus magnanime impartialité. Le juge, C. N. Broomsfield, racheta en ce jour bien des fautes du gouvernement. Le récit du procès, publié par les amis de Gandhi, a été reproduit en partie dans la presse d’Europe, et des échos en sont parvenus en France. Je le résumerai donc seulement.
U||[141] The Great Trial, 23 mars 1922, Young India.
U||Pourquoi le gouvernement s’était-il résolu à arrêter Gandhi ? Après avoir, deux ans, hésité à le faire, comment avait-il pu choisir, pour donner l’ordre, le moment où le Mahâtmâ venait de refréner la révolte de son peuple et paraissait la seule barrière à la violence ? Était-ce aberration ? Ou voulait-il confirmer la terrible phrase de Gandhi : « Il semble que le gouvernement désire voir ce pays couvert de meurtres, d’incendies et de rapines, pour avoir un prétexte à les réprimer ! » — En vérité, sa situation était difficile. Le gouvernement estimait et redoutait Gandhi. Il eût voulu le ménager ; mais Gandhi ne le ménageait point. Le Mahâtmâ condamnait la violence ; mais sa non-violence était plus révolutionnaire que toutes les violences. Dans les mêmes jours où il s’opposait à la Désobéissance civile en masse, la veille du Congrès de Delhi, le 23 février, il avait publié un de ses articles les plus menaçants pour la puissance britannique. Un
U|| insolent télégramme de lord Birkenhead et de M. Montagu venait de souffleter l’Inde[142]. Gandhi avait, dans un sursaut d’indignation, relevé l’injurieux défi :
U||[142] « Si l’existence de notre Empire était mise en jeu, si l’on empêchait le gouvernement britannique de remplir ses responsabilités envers l’Inde, si l’on s’imaginait que nous songions à nous retirer de l’Inde, l’Inde défierait sans succès le peuple le plus résolu du monde, qui répondrait avec toute la vigueur nécessaire. »
U||    « Point de compromis avec l’Empire, tant que le lion britannique secouera à notre face ses griffes sanglantes !… L’empire britannique, bâti sur l’exploitation organisée des races physiquement plus faibles de la terre et sur un étalage conventionnel de force brutale, ne peut durer, s’il y a un Dieu juste, gouvernant l’univers. Il est grand temps que le peuple britannique se rende compte que le combat, commencé en 1920, est un combat jusqu’au bout, qu’il dure un mois, un an, des mois ou des années… Je prie Dieu qu’il donne à l’Inde une humilité et une force suffisantes pour rester non-violente jusqu’à la fin. Mais se soumettre à ces insolents défis est impossible… »
U||C’était sur cet article et sur deux autres plus récents[143] que se fondait l’accusation. Gandhi était inculpé « d’avoir provoqué à la désaffection, d’avoir excité à la haine et au mépris contre le gouvernement de Sa Majesté, établi par les lois ». Il n’avait point de défenseur. Il plaida coupable à toutes les charges.
U||[143] Du 19 septembre et du 15 décembre 1921. Le premier, à propos de l’accusation portée contre les frères Ali ; le second, en réponse à un irritant discours de lord Reading. On y trouve la même déclaration de « guerre jusqu’au bout ». — « Nous voulons renverser le gouvernement, l’obliger à se soumettre à la volonté du peuple. Nous ne demandons pas quartier, nous ne l’attendons pas… »
U||L’avocat général, sir J. T. Strangman, de Bombay, soutint que les trois articles retenus par l’accusation n’étaient pas isolés, mais qu’ils faisaient partie d’une campagne poursuivie depuis deux ans contre le gouvernement, et il le prouva par des citations. Il reconnut les hautes qualités de Gandhi. Le mal que pouvaient causer de tels écrits n’en était que plus grave. Il attribua à Gandhi les événements sanglants de Bombay et de Chauri-Chaura. Sans doute, Gandhi prêchait la Non-violence, mais en même temps la désaffection. Il était donc responsable des violences populaires.
U||Gandhi demanda la parole. Ses combats de conscience, ses angoisses, ses doutes des dernières semaines sur la justesse des décisions qu’il avait dû prendre et sur les répercussions qu’elles pouvaient avoir dans la conscience de son peuple s’étaient dissipés. Il avait repris la maîtrise sereine de son âme. Il acceptait tout ce qui s’était passé, tout ce qui se passerait encore, comme une nécessité, qu’il pouvait regretter, mais qu’il devait porter. — Il se déclara d’accord avec l’avocat-général. Oui, il était responsable ! Il l’était entièrement. Il prêchait la désaffection, depuis bien plus longtemps que ne disait l’accusation. C’était chez lui une passion. Il prenait sur lui tout le blâme des troubles de Madras, des « crimes diaboliques » de Chauri-Chaura et des « outrages insensés » de Bombay…
U||    « L’avocat général a raison quand il dit que, comme homme responsable, ayant reçu une bonne part d’éducation, ayant récolté une bonne part d’expérience de ce monde, j’aurais dû savoir les conséquences de mes actes. Je savais que je jouais avec le feu. J’en ai couru le risque ; et si j’étais mis en liberté, je recommencerais. J’y ai mûrement réfléchi, ces nuits dernières. J’ai senti ce matin que je n’aurais pas fait mon devoir, si je ne disais pas ce que je dis à présent. Je tenais et je tiens à éviter la violence. La Non-violence est le premier article de ma foi et le dernier. Mais j’avais à choisir : — ou bien me soumettre à un système politique que je considère comme ayant fait un mal irréparable à mon pays, — ou bien courir le risque que se déchaîne la fureur insensée de mon peuple, quand il apprendrait de mes lèvres la vérité. Je sais que mon peuple quelquefois devient fou. J’en suis profondément fâché ; et c’est pourquoi je suis ic
U||i pour me soumettre, non à un châtiment léger, mais au plus lourd. Je ne demande pas miséricorde, je ne plaide aucune circonstance atténuante. Je suis ici pour demander et pour accepter joyeusement la plus haute peine qui puisse être infligée pour ce qui, selon la loi, est un crime délibéré, et qui me paraît, à moi, le premier devoir d’un citoyen. Juges, vous n’avez pas le choix : démissionnez, ou châtiez-moi !… »
U||Après cette improvisation énergique, où s’équilibrent magnifiquement les scrupules d’une conscience religieuse et l’héroïque fermeté du chef politique, Gandhi lut une déclaration écrite, qui s’adresse au public de l’Inde et de l’Angleterre. Il leur doit, dit-il, de leur faire connaître « pourquoi, de loyaliste et de coopérateur fervent au régime britannique », il est devenu « désaffectionné et non-coopérateur intransigeant ». Il refait le tableau de sa vie publique depuis 1893. Il rappelle tout ce qu’il a eu à souffrir, comme Indien, du système britannique, ses efforts de vingt-cinq ans pour l’améliorer, dans l’illusion obstinée que ce serait possible sans détacher l’Inde de l’Empire. Jusqu’en 1919, malgré tous les déboires, il a défendu la coopération. Mais outrages et forfaits ont passé la mesure. Et le gouvernement, au lieu de les réparer, a, par un suprême défi à la conscience de l’Inde, honoré, pensionné, récompensé les coupables. Le
U|| gouvernement a rompu lui-même les liens de ses sujets. Maintenant, Gandhi en est venu à cette conviction que les réformes mêmes proposées par l’Angleterre seraient mortelles pour l’Inde. Le gouvernement repose sur l’exploitation des masses. La loi est faite pour cette exploitation. L’administration de la loi est prostituée au service de l’exploiteur. Un système subtil et efficace de terrorisme a avili le peuple, lui a appris la dissimulation. L’Inde est ruinée, affamée, dégradée ; et certains ont pu dire qu’avant d’être en état de se gouverner elle-même comme un Dominion, il lui faudrait des générations. Aucun des gouvernements qui, dans le passé, ont opprimé l’Inde, ne lui a fait autant de mal que l’Angleterre. La Non-coopération avec le crime est un devoir. Gandhi l’a accompli. Mais au lieu que, jusqu’ici, la violence était le suprême recours, il a donné à son peuple l’arme souveraine, la Non-violence.
U||Ici s’ouvre la chevaleresque passe d’armes entre le juge Broomsfield et le Mahâtmâ :
U||— « Monsieur Gandhi, en reconnaissant les faits, vous avez rendu ma tâche aisée, dans une certaine mesure. Mais la détermination d’une juste sentence est des plus difficiles qu’un juge ait à prendre… Il est impossible de paraître ignorer que vous êtes aux yeux de millions d’hommes un grand chef et un grand patriote. Même ceux qui diffèrent de vous en politique vous regardent comme un homme de haut idéal, d’une vie noble et même sainte… Mais mon devoir est de vous juger seulement comme homme sujet de la loi… Il y a probablement peu de personnes dans l’Inde qui ne regrettent sincèrement que vous ayez rendu impossible à un gouvernement de vous laisser en liberté. Mais c’est ainsi… J’essaie de mettre en balance ce qui vous est dû avec l’intérêt public… »
U||Courtoisement, il consulte l’accusé sur la peine qui pourrait lui être infligée. Il lui propose l’exemple de la sentence prononcée, douze ans auparavant, contre Tilak : six ans d’emprisonnement… « Ne le considérerez-vous pas comme déraisonnable ?… Si, par suite des événements, il est possible de réduire ce temps, personne n’en sera plus heureux que moi… »
U||Gandhi n’est pas en reste d’accortise. Il regarde comme le plus fier honneur de voir son nom associé à celui de Tilak. La sentence est la plus légère qu’un juge puisse lui infliger ; et pour tout son procès, il ne pouvait attendre plus d’égards[144].
U||[144] Le gérant Banker, qui, pendant le procès, avait suivi religieusement l’exemple du Mahâtmâ et acquiescé à toutes ses paroles, fut condamné à un an de prison avec amende.
U||Le procès était terminé. Les amis de Gandhi tombèrent à ses pieds, en sanglotant. Le Mahâtmâ souriant prit congé d’eux. Et la porte de la prison de Sabarmati se referma sur lui[145].
U||[145] Mme Kasturibai Gandhi annonça la sentence aux hommes et aux femmes de l’Inde, en un message très digne, qui les invite à se concentrer, dans le calme, sur le programme constructif de Gandhi.
U||Gandhi ne fut point laissé dans la prison de Sabarmati, où il était bien traité. On le transféra dans un lieu secret, puis à Yeravda, près Poona. Un récit de N. S. Hardiker : Gandhi en prison (Unity, 18 mal 1922), assure qu’il fut mis au régime cellulaire de droit commun, sans aucun privilège, et que sa santé délicate en souffrit. Mais nous savons qu’à présent, le régime est redevenu plus humain. Il est permis à Gandhi de lire et d’écrire.
U||D’après ce que m’a dit C.-F. Andrews, le Mahâtmâ est heureux en prison ; il a demandé à ses amis de ne pas venir le voir et de respecter sa solitude ; il se purifie, il prie et il est convaincu que son action est ainsi la plus efficace, pour la cause de l’Inde. — En fait, C.-F. Andrews assure que le parti gandhiste a beaucoup gagné à cet emprisonnement. L’Inde croit en Gandhi, avec plus de ferveur que jamais ; elle persiste à voir en lui une incarnation de Shri-Krishna, qui, d’après la légende, subit victorieusement, l’épreuve de la prison. Et Gandhi emprisonné a, plus sûrement que libre, empêché l’explosion de la violence dont il sentait le danger.
U||V
U||Depuis, la grande voix de l’apôtre s’est tue. Son corps est muré comme dans un tombeau. Mais jamais les tombeaux n’ont enfermé la pensée. Et son âme invisible continue d’animer le corps immense de l’Inde. Paix, Non-violence et Souffrance est l’unique message venu de la prison[146]. Il a été entendu. Le mot d’ordre s’est transmis d’un bout à l’autre du pays. Trois ans avant, l’Inde eût été ensanglantée par l’arrestation de Gandhi. Quand le bruit en courut, en mars 1919, des populations se soulevèrent. La sentence d’Ahmedabad fut reçue par le silence religieux de l’Inde. Des milliers d’Indiens se firent emprisonner, avec une joie paisible. Non-violence et souffrance… Un exemple extraordinaire montra à quelles profondeurs la parole divine avait pénétré dans l’âme de la nation.
U||[146] La revue Unity a publié (3 août 1922) une Lettre de la prison contre la civilisation moderne, qui me paraît apocryphe. J’y verrais un pastiche de pages anciennes, extraites de l’Hind Swarâj.
U||Les Sikhs, comme on le sait, furent toujours une des races les plus belliqueuses de l’Inde ; ils avaient servi en masse pendant la grande guerre. Au cours de l’année passée, un grave différend s’éleva entre eux. Le prétexte en était futile (à nos yeux d’Européens). Une renaissance religieuse Sikh avait fait surgir la secte des Akalis, qui voulurent purifier les sanctuaires. Ces sanctuaires étaient devenus l’apanage de gardiens mal famés, qui refusèrent de s’en laisser déloger. Le gouvernement, pour des raisons légales, prit leur défense. Alors, commença, vers août 1922, le martyre quotidien de Guru-Ka-Bagh[147]. Les Akalis avaient épousé la doctrine de la Non-résistance. Mille d’entre eux s’installèrent près du sanctuaire, quatre mille dans le Temple d’Or d’Amritsar. Chaque jour, cent volontaires (la plupart d’âge militaire, beaucoup ayant servi dans la dernière guerre) partaient du Temple d’Or, après avoir fait le vœu de ne pas employer la violence, ni en a
U||ctes, ni en paroles, et d’atteindre le Guru-Ka-Bagh, ou d’être rapportés sans connaissance. De l’autre groupe de mille, vingt-cinq Akalis prononçaient le même vœu. Non loin du sanctuaire, la police britannique les attendait sur un pont, avec de longues perches au bout ferré. Et quotidiennement, se déroulait une scène hallucinante, que nous retrace un récit inoubliable d’Andrews[148], ami de Tagore et professeur à Santiniketan. Les Akalis, en turban noir orné d’une petite guirlande de fleurs blanches, arrivent en face de la bande de police, et s’arrêtent à un mètre, silencieux, immobiles et priant. Les policiers les frappent violemment de leurs longs bâtons. Les Sikhs roulent à terre, se relèvent s’ils peuvent, recommencent, sont de nouveau frappés, quelquefois piétinés jusqu’à perte de connaissance. Andrews n’entend pas un cri, ne remarque pas un regard de défi. Autour, à quelque distance, une centaine de spectateurs, le visage tendu d’angoisse, prient silencieuseme
U||nt, avec une expression d’adoration et de souffrance. « Ils me rappelaient, dit Andrews, l’ombre de la Croix ». Les Anglais qui racontent la scène dans leurs journaux[149], s’étonnent, ne comprennent point, constatent à regret que l’absurde sacrifice est une victoire éclatante pour l’armée de la Non-coopération, et que le peuple de Punjab en est fasciné. Mais le généreux Andrews, dont le pur idéalisme a appris à déchiffrer l’âme de l’Inde, a vu là, comme Gœthe à Valmy, le début d’une ère nouvelle : « un nouvel héroïsme, appris par la souffrance, s’est levé sur cette terre ; une nouvelle guerre de l’esprit… »
U||[147] Guru-Ka-Bagh est le jardin d’un sanctuaire (Gurdwara), à dix milles d’Amritsar.

U||Le peuple semble avoir mieux gardé la pensée du Mahâtmâ que ceux qui avaient reçu la charge de le guider. On a vu l’opposition qui s’était manifestée, au Comité du Congrès de Delhi, vingt jours avant l’arrestation du Maître. Elle se renouvela, quand le Comité du Congrès se réunit de nouveau, à Lucknow, le 7 juin 1922. Un vif mécontentement régnait, à l’égard du programme de patiente construction et d’attente, imposé par Gandhi ; le désir s’affirma d’en venir à la Désobéissance civile. Une Commission d’enquête fut nommée, pour examiner si la préparation du pays à la Désobéissance était suffisante. Elle fit le tour de l’Inde ; et son rapport, déposé à l’automne, fut décourageant : non seulement il concluait à l’impossibilité actuelle de la Désobéissance, mais la moitié des membres (des hommes d’une foi éprouvée) voulaient qu’on renonçât même aux méthodes gandhistes de Non-coopération, au boycott des fonctions politiques, et qu’un par
U||ti Swarâj (Home Rule) se formât, au sein des Conseils du gouvernement, bref que la Non-coopération devînt en fait une opposition parlementaire[150]. Ainsi, la doctrine de Gandhi était battue en brèche, d’un côté par les violents, de l’autre par les modérés.
U||[150] Lajpat Rai m’a fait observer qu’aucun des membres du Congrès de Lucknow ne croyait en la violence. Tous gardaient leur foi dans le programme constructif de Gandhi ; mais ils voulaient se saisir des Conseils et de l’Assemblée, qui faisaient beaucoup de mal au pays. Ayant été vaincus à Gaya, ils formèrent un parti séparé Swarâj, au sein du Congrès, le 2 janvier 1923. Ils restaient en accord avec Gandhi sur le programme constructif, et ne pouvaient s’entendre avec lui sur la seule question de l’entrée dans les Conseils.
U||Mais l’Inde protesta. Le Congrès National Indien, dans sa réunion annuelle de fin décembre 1922, à Gaya, réaffirma énergiquement sa fidélité au maître persécuté et sa foi en la doctrine de la Non-coopération. Par 1740 voix contre 890, il rejeta la proposition de participer aux Conseils législatifs[151]. Et finalement, l’unanimité se retrouva pour continuer la grève politique, avec de simples différences de détail dans les méthodes. On écarta seulement un projet de boycott de toutes les marchandises anglaises. Plus hardie comme toujours, la Conférence musulmane du Khilafat avait voté ce boycott, à une forte majorité.
U||[151] Quant aux éléments révolutionnaires violents, ils étaient peu nombreux à Gaya, et ils n’y jouèrent qu’un rôle de second plan.
U||C’est à ce point de l’histoire que nous devons interrompre notre récit du grand mouvement gandhiste. Malgré quelques fléchissements inévitables en l’absence du maître et de ses meilleurs disciples, de ses lieutenants (notamment, des frères Ali), comme lui emprisonnés, il a résisté victorieusement à l’épreuve redoutable de la première année sans guide. Et la déception avouée par la presse anglaise, après le Congrès de Gaya, montre bien l’importance de la partie gagnée[152].
U||[152] Un article de Blanche Watson (Unity, 16 novembre 1922) énumère « les avantages que l’Inde a retirés de sa lutte de résistance non-violente ». Elle assure que les revenus intérieurs de l’Inde ont diminué d’environ 75 millions de dollars, et que le boycott du tissu anglais a fait perdre à l’Angleterre, en une année, 20 millions de dollars. Elle évalue à 30.000 le nombre des Indiens qui étaient, à cette date, emprisonnés, et représente le mécanisme administratif du gouvernement, comme entièrement détraqué. Mais Blanche Watson, fervente admiratrice du Gandhisme, a, sans doute, une tendance inconsciente à en exagérer le succès. D’autres témoignages se montrent moins satisfaits. Ils disent que le mouvement de sacrifice se heurte à l’égoïsme des classes commerçantes et aisées, et que beaucoup de démissions, données dans le premier élan, ont été, depuis, retirées. Il ne serait pas humain de supposer le contraire. Dans toute révolution, beaucoup restent en arr
U||ière, ou reviennent sur leurs pas. La question est de savoir si le courant se maintient dans les couches profondes. Voici un témoignage, de l’importance et de l’impartialité duquel il est impossible de douter :
U||Le Manchester Guardian, dont on connaît l’intelligent libéralisme, mais qui représente de puissants intérêts directement mis en péril par la Non-coopération gandhiste, vient de procéder à une enquête attentive à travers l’Inde. Cette enquête a été publiée en une série d’articles. Malgré le manque de sympathie (bien naturel) qui s’y marque, à l’égard du mouvement indien, et malgré un parti-pris de le déprécier, on sent, d’article en article, à l’inquiétude croissante, la gravité de la situation pour l’Angleterre. Je résume l’article de conclusion, paru le 16 février 1923 (Manchester Guardian Weekly). L’enquêteur veut se persuader que la tactique gandhiste a subi un fort échec et que la Non-coopération doit se réorganiser sur de nouveaux plans. « Mais, ajoute-t-il, l’esprit de Non-coopération reste. C’est partout, sinon le pur Gandhisme, la méfiance du gouvernement étranger et l’ardent désir d’en être débarrassé. Les classes cultivées et les
U|| citadins sont imprégnés de cet esprit. Le ryot (paysan) en est touché encore assez superficiellement ; mais les conditions sont telles dans les villages, qu’il finira par être gagné. L’armée paraît encore indemne : mais elle est recrutée dans les villages ; et tôt ou tard, elle suivra le mouvement. C’est souvent chez les meilleurs, même chez les modérés, que cet esprit de Non-coopération est le plus fort. Les modérés ont seulement l’aversion des méthodes révolutionnaires ; mais cette aversion n’est pas partagée par le pays. Le pays sympathise avec la témérité des Non-coopérateurs, plus qu’avec la prudence des modérés. » L’observateur anglais évalue à une dizaine d’années le temps nécessaire à une organisation des paysans indiens, pour en arriver au refus de paiement des taxes et à la révolte. Mais d’ici là, la situation ne cessera d’empirer ; impossible de tenir encore les Indiens par la crainte de la prison : cette crainte n’existe plus chez 
U||eux ; il faudra en venir à des mesures coercitives plus dures, et elles ne feront qu’augmenter les haines. « Une seule solution pacifique est possible, s’il y en a encore une » : il faut que l’Angleterre prenne l’initiative du mouvement de réformes indiennes. Non plus des demi-réformes, comme celles qu’on a instituées en 1919 et tenté d’appliquer depuis un an à peine. Elles ne suffisent plus, et le temps presse. Que l’Angleterre réunisse une Convention nationale indienne, où tous les intérêts et toutes les nuances de pensée de l’Inde soient représentés : aussi bien Gandhi et ses disciples que les princes indiens et les capitalistes européens, les Musulmans, les Hindous, les Parsis, les Eurasiens, les Chrétiens, les Intouchables… Que cette Convention prépare une Constitution pour l’Inde autonome à l’intérieur de l’Empire, et qu’elle fixe les étapes d’exécution de ce Home Rule ! Ainsi, et ainsi seulement pourra être conjuré le déchirement de l’Empi
U||re.
U||Je ne sais dans quelle mesure le gouvernement de l’Inde et la bureaucratie anglaise accueilleraient un pareil projet, que le Manchester Guardian, après son correspondant, appuie avec énergie. J’ai quelque peine à croire que Gandhi et les Non-coopérateurs acceptent de s’associer en une même Assemblée, avec les capitalistes européens et indiens ! Mais ce qui paraît sûr, c’est que le Home Rule indien n’est maintenant plus en question. D’une façon ou de l’autre, il est inévitable. Et rien n’est plus frappant que le changement de ton de l’Angleterre à l’égard des Indiens, depuis le commencement de l’action de Gandhi. Le mépris européen pour les Indiens n’est plus. On s’efforce de parler d’eux avec égards, et l’on s’accorde à flétrir les violences maladroites, qui étaient naguère le suprême secours du pouvoir et parfois même le premier. L’Inde a, moralement, vaincu.
U||Qu’en adviendra-t-il, par la suite ? L’Angleterre, instruite par les fautes passées, ne se montrera-t-elle pas plus habile à capter cet élan d’un peuple ? La constance de ce peuple ne se lassera-t-elle point ? Les peuples ont peu de mémoire ; et je douterais fort que celle des hommes de l’Inde conservât bien longtemps les leçons du Mahâtmâ, si elles n’étaient dès longtemps inscrites au plus profond de la race. Car si un génie est grand, par sa seule grandeur, qu’elle soit ou non d’accord avec ceux qui l’entourent, il n’est de génie d’action que celui qui répond aux instincts de sa race, aux besoins de son temps, à l’attente du monde.
U||Tel est Mahâtmâ Gandhi. Son principe de l’Ahimsâ (la Non-violence) était gravé au cœur de l’Inde depuis deux mille années : Mahâvira, Buddha et le culte de Vishnu en avaient fait la substance de ces millions d’âmes. Gandhi y a seulement transfusé son sang héroïque. Il évoque les ombres gigantesques, les forces du passé, engourdies et prostrées dans une léthargie mortelle. Et à sa voix, elles se sont levées. Car elles se reconnaissent en lui. Il est plus qu’une parole, il est un exemple. Il les a incarnées. Heureux l’homme qui est un peuple, — son peuple mis au tombeau, qui ressuscite en lui !
U||Mais ces résurrections ne se produisent jamais au hasard. Et si l’esprit de l’Inde vient de surgir de ses temples et de ses forêts, c’est qu’il apporte au monde la réponse prédestinée que le monde attendait.
U||La réponse, en effet, dépasse infiniment l’Inde. L’Inde seule pouvait la donner. Mais elle consacre autant sa grandeur que son sacrifice. Elle risque d’être sa croix.
U||Il semble qu’il faille toujours, pour que le monde se renouvelle, qu’un peuple se sacrifie. Les Juifs ont été sacrifiés à leur Messie, qu’après avoir porté, nourri de leurs espoirs, pendant des siècles, ils n’ont pas reconnu, quand sur la croix sanglante enfin il a fleuri. Plus heureux, les Indiens ont reconnu le leur. Et c’est joyeusement qu’ils vont au-devant du sacrifice qui doit les délivrer.
U||Mais, comme les premiers chrétiens, tous ne comprennent pas le véritable sens de cette libération. Longtemps ceux-là attendirent sur leur terre l’adveniat regnum tuum. Les espoirs d’une grande part des Indiens ne voient pas au delà du règne du Swarâj dans l’Inde. Et je pense que, d’ailleurs, cet idéal politique sera promptement atteint. L’Europe, saignée par les guerres et les révolutions, appauvrie et lassée, dépouillée de son prestige, aux yeux de l’Asie qu’elle opprimait, ne sera plus longtemps de taille à tenir tête, sur le sol de l’Asie, aux peuples réveillés de l’Islam, de l’Inde, de la Chine et du Japon.
U||Mais ce serait peu de chose que quelques nations de plus, — si riches que puissent être les neuves harmonies, dont elles enrichiront la symphonie humaine, — ce serait peu de chose, si ces forces de l’Asie n’étaient le véhicule d’une nouvelle raison de vivre, de mourir, et (ce qui compte le plus !) d’agir pour toute l’humanité, si elles n’apportaient à l’Europe épuisée un nouveau viatique.
U||Le monde est balayé par le vent de la violence. Cet orage qui brûle les moissons de notre civilisation n’avait rien d’imprévu. Des siècles de brutal orgueil national, exalté par l’idéologie idolâtrique de la Révolution, propagé par le mimétisme aveugle des démocraties, — et, pour couronnement, un siècle d’industrialisme inhumain et de gloutonne ploutocratie, un machinisme asservisseur, un matérialisme économique où l’âme meurt étouffée, — devaient fatalement mener à ces confuses mêlées, où disparaissent les trésors de l’Occident. Ce ne serait pas assez de dire qu’il y avait là une nécessité. Il y a là une Dikè. Chaque peuple égorge l’autre, au nom des mêmes principes, qui masquent les mêmes intérêts et les mêmes instincts de Caïns. Chacun, — nationalistes, fascistes, bolcheviks, peuples et classes opprimés, peuples et classes oppresseurs, — chacun revendique pour soi, en le refusant aux autres, le droit à la violence, qui lui paraît le Droit. Il y
U|| a un demi-siècle, la Force primait le Droit. Aujourd’hui, c’est bien pire : la Force est le Droit. Elle l’a dévoré.
U||Dans ce vieux monde qui s’écroule, nul asile, nul espoir. Aucune grande lumière. L’Église donne des conseils anodins, vertueux et dosés, qui veillent prudemment à ne la point brouiller avec les puissants ; au reste, elle conseille, et ne donne point l’exemple. De fades pacifistes bêlent languissamment, et l’on sent qu’ils hésitent ; ils parlent d’une foi, qu’ils ne sont pas sûrs d’avoir. Qui leur prouvera cette foi ? Et comment, au milieu de ce monde qui la nie ? — Comme une foi se prouve. En agissant !
U||Voilà le Message au monde, comme l’appelle Gandhi, le message de l’Inde : « Sacrifions-nous ! »
U||Et Tagore l’a redit, en paroles magiques[153] : car sur ce fier principe, Tagore et Gandhi ne sont qu’un :
U||[153] Lettre du 2 mars 1921, publiée dans la Modern Review, mai 1921.
U||    « … J’espère que croîtra, vigoureux, cet esprit de sacrifice, ce consentement à souffrir… C’est la vraie liberté… Nulle valeur n’est plus haute, — pas même l’indépendance nationale… L’Occident a sa foi inébranlable en la force et en la richesse matérielles : par conséquent, il aura beau crier pour la paix et le désarmement, sa férocité grondera toujours plus fort. Tel un poisson que blesserait la pression de l’eau, et qui voudrait voler : brillante idée ! mais totalement impossible à réaliser pour un poisson. Nous, dans l’Inde, nous avons à montrer au monde ce qu’est cette vérité qui, non seulement rend possible le désarmement, mais le transmue en force. Le fait que la force morale est une puissance supérieure à la force brutale sera prouvé par le peuple qui est sans armes. L’évolution de la Vie montre qu’elle a peu à peu rejeté son formidable fardeau d’armure et une monstrueuse quantité de chair, jusqu’au jour où l’homme est devenu le c
U||onquérant du monde brutal. Le jour viendra où le frêle homme de cœur, complètement dégagé de l’armure, prouvera que ce sont les doux qui héritent de la terre. Il est donc logique que Mahâtmâ Gandhi, de corps débile et dénué de toutes ressources matérielles, évoque l’immense pouvoir des doux et humbles, qui attend caché dans le cœur de l’humanité de l’Inde outragée et destituée. Les destinées de l’Inde ont choisi pour allié Nârâyana, et non Nârâyani-senâ, la puissance de l’âme, et non celle du muscle. Elle doit élever l’histoire humaine, du niveau fangeux de la mêlée matérielle aux cimes des batailles de l’esprit… Quoique nous puissions nous abuser, avec les phrases apprises de l’Occident, le Swarâj (Home Rule) n’est pas notre but. Notre combat est un combat spirituel. C’est un combat pour l’Homme. Nous devons émanciper l’Homme des réseaux qu’il a tissés autour de lui, de ces organisations d’Égoïsme national. Il nous faut persuader au papil
U||lon que la liberté du ciel vaut plus que l’abri du cocon… Nous n’avons pas de terme pour Nation, dans notre langue. Quand nous empruntons ce mot aux autres peuples, il ne nous va point, car nous devons nous liguer avec Nârâyana, l’Etre suprême ; et notre victoire ne nous donnera rien d’autre que la victoire pour le monde de Dieu… Si nous pouvons défier les forts, les riches, les armés, en révélant du monde la puissance de l’esprit immortel, tout le château du géant Chair s’effondrera dans le vide. Et alors, l’Homme trouvera le vrai Swarâj. Nous, les gueux déguenillés de l’Orient, nous conquerrons la liberté pour toute l’Humanité… »
U||O Tagore, Gandhi, fleuves de l’Inde qui, pareils à l’Indus et au Gange, embrassez dans votre double étreinte l’Orient et l’Occident, — celui-ci, tragédie de l’action héroïque ; celui-là, vaste songe de lumière, — tous deux ruisselants de Dieu, sur le monde labouré par le soc de la violence, répandez ses semences !
U||« Notre lutte, déclare Gandhi, a pour fin l’amitié avec le monde entier… La Non-violence est venue parmi les hommes ; et elle restera. Elle est l’Annonciatrice de la paix du monde… »
U||La paix du monde est loin. Nous n’avons pas d’illusions. Nous avons vu abondamment, au cours d’un demi-siècle, les mensonges, les lâchetés et les cruautés de l’espèce humaine. Ce qui n’empêche point de l’aimer. Car, même chez les plus vils, il y a un nescio quid Dei… Nous n’ignorons rien des fatalités matérielles qui pèsent sur l’Europe du XXe siècle, l’écrasant déterminisme des conditions économiques qui l’enserrent, les siècles de passions et d’erreurs pétrifiées qui constituent autour des âmes de notre temps une croûte dure, que ne peut trouer la lumière. Mais nous connaissons aussi les miracles de l’esprit. Historien, nous avons vu leurs éclairs transpercer des cieux plus sombres que le nôtre. Vivant d’une heure, nous entendons dans l’Inde le tambour de Çiva, « le Maître-Danseur, qui voile son regard dévorant et maîtrise ses pas pour sauver l’univers du retour à l’abîme… »[154]
U||[154] Extrait de la plus antique invocation à Çiva, dans la pièce Mudrâ-Râkshasa par Vishâkhadatta.
U||Les Realpolitiker de la violence (révolutionnaire ou réactionnaire) se raillent de cette foi ; et ils montrent ainsi leur ignorance des réalités profondes. Qu’ils se raillent ! J’ai cette foi. Je la vois bafouée ou persécutée en Europe ; et, dans mon propre pays, nous sommes une poignée… (Sommes-nous même une poignée ?…) Mais quand je serais seul à croire, que m’importe ? Le propre de la foi est — loin de nier l’hostilité du monde — de la voir et de croire, — contre elle : c’est encore mieux ! Car la foi est un combat. Et notre Non-violence est le plus rude combat. Le chemin de la paix n’est pas celui de la faiblesse. Nous sommes moins ennemis de la violence que de la faiblesse. Rien ne vaut sans la force : ni le mal ni le bien. Et mieux vaut le mal entier que le bien émasculé. Le pacifisme geignant est mortel à la paix : il est une lâcheté et un manque de foi. Que ceux qui ne croient pas, ou qui craignent, se retirent ! Le chemin de la paix est le sacrifi
U||ce de soi.
U||C’est la leçon de Gandhi[155]. Il ne lui manque que la Croix. Chacun sait que, sans les Juifs, Rome l’eût refusée au Christ. Et le British Empire vaut l’Empire Romain. Mais l’élan est donné. L’âme des peuples d’Orient en a été remuée jusqu’en ses profondeurs ; et ses vibrations s’étendent à toute la terre.
U||[155] Et c’est aussi l’exemple des Conscientious Objectors qui d’Angleterre, essaiment dans tous les pays d’Europe.
U||Les grandes apparitions religieuses en Orient ont un rythme. De deux choses l’une, ou celle de Gandhi vaincra, ou elle se répétera, — comme se sont répétés, des siècles à l’avance, le Messie et Buddha, — jusqu’à l’incarnation complète en un demi-dieu mortel, du principe de Vie qui mènera vers la nouvelle étape l’humanité nouvelle.
U||Février 1923.
U||FIN
U||GANDHI DEPUIS SA LIBÉRATION
U||POSTFACE A LA XXXIe ÉDITION
U||La première édition de ce livre paraissait il y a trois mois.
U||Depuis, trois faits nouveaux ont, sans le modifier, accentué les grandes lignes du tableau :
U||Le parti Swarajiste indien, constitué par le chef politique le plus important de l’Inde et ami de Gandhi, C.-R. Das, — parti qui concilie les méthodes de Non-Violence avec la participation aux Conseils législatifs, — a remporté une victoire imposante, aux élections de la fin décembre 1923.
U||Les frères Ali, chefs reconnus des Mahométans de l’Inde et amis de Gandhi, ayant accompli leur peine de deux années de prison, ont repris leur place à la tête du mouvement national indien ; et l’un d’eux, Maulana Mohamed Ali, est devenu le président du Congrès de toute l’Inde.
U||Enfin, Gandhi lui-même a été remis en liberté.
U||L’Europe a appris la libération du Mahâtmâ. Mais elle ne sait pas à quelles heures critiques cette libération a été donnée. On lui a caché que peu s’en est fallu que le gouvernement anglais ne vît mourir dans ses mains son prisonnier.
U||Il était enfermé à Yeravada, près de Poona (province de Bombay). Depuis longtemps, il s’affaiblissait ; sa maigreur était extrême. En décembre, il fut pris de douleurs abdominales, auxquelles on prêta peu d’attention ; la fièvre s’installa. La famille, qui ne pouvait le visiter, était tenue dans l’ignorance.
U||Au début de janvier, la quiétude officielle fut brusquement secouée. L’état devint si inquiétant qu’on appela d’urgence en consultation le colonel Maddock, « Civil surgeon », qui reconnut une appendicite grave en pleine crise. Sans l’esprit de décision du chirurgien, Gandhi était perdu. Maddock n’attendit pas d’avoir les autorisations nécessaires ; il prit sur lui d’emmener Gandhi sur-le-champ dans son auto à l’hôpital Sassoon de Poona ; il le mit sur une civière, qu’il porta lui-même avec l’aide de quelques étudiants ; et, le soir (samedi 12 janvier), il l’opéra. Au dehors, nul ne savait rien ; la famille ne fut prévenue qu’après. Mais, à l’intérieur de l’hôpital, et dans les milieux officiels, l’anxiété était extrême. La responsabilité qui pesait sur les autorités anglaises était formidable. Si le Mahâtmâ mourait, l’Inde entière se soulevait.
U||Seul, le Mahâtmâ gardait son calme et sa douceur. Afin d’atténuer leur périlleuse charge, au cas d’un résultat fatal, les autorités firent appeler comme témoin, une heure avant l’opération, un chef du parti libéral indien, Sastri, qui avait été un des adversaires politiques de Gandhi, mais que celui-ci estimait. Et Sastri a publié le récit de cette heure angoissante[156].
U||[156] Swarajya, Madras, mardi 15 janvier.
U||On pria Gandhi de signer un papier, où il donnait son consentement à l’opération. Gandhi mit ses lunettes, lut attentivement et, demandant la permission de changer le texte, il dicta une lettre adressée au colonel Maddock : il y remerciait courtoisement les médecins et les autorités des bons soins donnés, affirmait sa confiance en son chirurgien, et réclamait l’opération immédiate. Puis, il releva ses genoux, y posa le papier, et signa au crayon d’une main qui tremblait beaucoup. On le laissa seul, quelques instants, avec Sastri, pour préparer la salle d’opérations. Le Mahâtmâ se mit à causer tranquillement. Et voici ses paroles textuelles :
U||« … Mon conflit avec le gouvernement continue et continuera aussi longtemps que persisteront les motifs qui l’ont provoqué. Il ne peut y avoir aucune condition. Si le gouvernement pense que mes motifs étaient bons et que je suis innocent, s’il pense qu’il m’a gardé assez longtemps prisonnier, il peut me laisser partir : cela serait honorable pour lui… On peut me libérer, mais ce ne doit pas être pour de faux prétextes… »
U||(C’est-à-dire, comme il le redira explicitement, qu’il n’accepte pas sa libération pour cause de maladie.)
U||Il ajoute que, « tandis qu’il a un profond discord avec le gouvernement, il aime individuellement les Anglais », et que si le peuple de l’Inde fait de l’agitation après sa libération, — « ce qu’il ne désire pas » — il prie que ce soit selon l’esprit de non-violence.
U||Sastri lui demanda alors s’il ne voudrait pas adresser un Message à son peuple. Gandhi devait le désirer d’autant plus que, depuis son incarcération, sa voix était étouffée. Après sa condamnation, il avait envoyé au président du Congrès national indien une lettre pour ses compatriotes ; mais la lettre fut interceptée par le gouvernement, qui voulut l’amender : ce que Gandhi refusa. Tout autre, à sa place, eût donc, à l’heure d’une opération qui pouvait être mortelle, saisi cette occasion de faire savoir à son peuple ses suprêmes volontés. Mais, avec cet admirable sens de l’honneur chevaleresque, qui est un des traits les plus frappants du Mahâtmâ, et qui semble aujourd’hui presque anachronique, Gandhi refusa. Il se considérait comme lié au silence.
U||Il répondit à Sastri qu’il était prisonnier du gouvernement, et qu’il devait observer le code d’honneur du prisonnier. Il était censé mort civilement. Il n’avait pas de Message à donner…
U||A ce moment — il était dix heures du soir — la porte s’ouvrit. On vint le prendre pour le porter sur la table d’opération.
U||L’opération dura vingt minutes ; et un accident faillit la rendre fatale. Le patient venait d’être chloroformé, quand la lumière électrique s’éteignit. On courut chercher des lampes à huile, puis des lampes à incandescence. L’incision révéla un abcès caché, purulent et très profond. On dut laisser dans la plaie un tube de six pouces, pour vider le foyer d’infection. Gandhi supporta bien l’opération ; mais la nuit resta inquiétante.
U||Le lendemain, arrivèrent les fils de Gandhi, enfin prévenus, puis madame Gandhi. Et le pays entier fut, pendant quelques jours, en proie à un délire d’anxiété. Le président du Congrès de toute l’Inde, Mohamed Ali, fit décréter des prières nationales dans tout le pays pour le 18 janvier. De tous côtés, la libération de Gandhi fut demandée, même par des journaux du gouvernement. Il fallait sortir au plus tôt de la situation dangereuse où la vie menacée de Gandhi mettait ceux qui le tenaient prisonnier. Le 17 janvier, le gouverneur de Bombay fut mandé brusquement à Delhi, chez le vice-roi, lord Reading. La session de la nouvelle Assemblée législative indienne devait s’ouvrir à la fin du mois. On devait lui enlever ce sujet d’agitation. L’ordre de libération fut donné, le 4 février.
U||Et aussitôt, le Mahâtmâ, déchargé de ses scrupules, redevenu libre de sa voix comme de sa pensée, envoya un Message au président du Congrès de toute l’Inde (7 février)[157].
U||[157] Hindu, Madras, 8 février.
U||Il commence par regretter l’acte du gouvernement, qu’il ne saurait accepter comme une grâce.
U||« Je suis fâché que le gouvernement m’ait libéré prématurément, pour cause de maladie ; ce genre de libération ne peut me faire aucune joie, car je considère que la maladie d’un prisonnier n’offre pas de raison pour le mettre en liberté. »
U||Avec sa belle courtoisie, il remercie tous ceux — (sans oublier personne) — qui, à l’hôpital ou en prison, l’ont traité avec égards. Il se dit impropre, pour quelque temps encore, au travail actif. Il a besoin de semaines de repos. Il lui faut d’ailleurs un certain temps pour se remettre au courant de la situation nouvelle de l’Inde : car il est resté au secret depuis deux ans. Il n’en donne pas moins de fermes conseils, qui montrent que rien n’a changé de ses décisions premières et de son programme d’action.
U||Avant tout, il faut refaire l’union de toutes les forces de l’Inde. En son absence, elle a été ébranlée.
U||« Si peu que je connaisse la situation présente du pays, j’en sais assez pour voir que les problèmes nationaux sont bien plus embarrassants aujourd’hui qu’au temps de Bardoli. Sans l’unité des diverses races et religions, toute idée de Swaraj (home rule) est vide de sens. Cette unité, que je croyais presque atteinte en 1922, a gravement souffert, entre Hindous et Musulmans. Si nous voulons conquérir notre liberté, il faut resserrer un lien indissoluble entre les diverses communautés. Je ne vous demande pas d’actions de grâces pour ma guérison. Votre union me rendra la santé plus vite que tous les soins médicaux. Mon cœur a été accablé par ce que j’ai appris de vos dissentiments. Tant que ce fardeau pèsera sur moi, je ne puis prendre de repos. Je fais appel à tous ceux qui ont de l’amour pour moi. Unissez-vous ! Je sais que la tâche est difficile ; mais rien n’est difficile, si nous avons une foi vivante en Dieu. Hindous, mahométans, mettez fin à votre mutuelle méf
U||iance ! C’est la faiblesse qui engendre la crainte, et la crainte la méfiance. Rejetons, l’un et l’autre, nos craintes ! Même, si l’un, seul, de nous cesse de craindre, nous cesserons de nous quereller. Je sais qu’au fond nous nous aimons comme des frères. Je vous demande de partager mon anxieuse volonté d’union… »
U||Quant à sa tactique de combat, elle reste la même. Deux ans de méditation solitaire n’ont fait que le convaincre davantage de son efficacité. En premier lieu, le rouet, comme seul remède contre le paupérisme. L’union des races. La disparition de « l’intouchabilité ». L’application méthodique de la Non-Violence en pensées, en paroles et en actions…
U||« Si nous exécutons fidèlement ce programme, nous n’aurons pas besoin de recourir à la Désobéissance civile. Mais je dois ajouter que mes méditations n’ont pas affaibli ma croyance en l’efficacité et la justice de la Désobéissance civile. Je soutiens qu’elle est une arme pour le droit, et le devoir d’une nation, quand son être vital est mis en péril. Je suis convaincu qu’elle comporte moins de dangers que la guerre. Et tandis que la Désobéissance civile, quand elle réussit, fait du bien aux deux partis, la guerre fait du mal à la fois au vainqueur et au vaincu. »
U||Sur la tactique du nouveau parti Swaraj, fondé par son ami C.-R. Das, il évite de se prononcer encore. Il se trouvait en face d’une situation politique nouvelle, qu’il voulait étudier, avant de la juger. Aux élections législatives de fin décembre, les Swarajstes (nationalistes indiens de gauche, partisans de la Non-Violence, mais dans le cadre des moyens parlementaires mis à leur disposition par la Constitution réformée) avaient conquis environ la moitié des 103 sièges électifs de l’Assemblée de toute l’Inde ; et dans les Conseils provinciaux, leur parti était devenu presque partout le plus fort[158]. Ils en avaient usé pour émettre aussitôt (dès la fin de décembre) une série de revendications et de résolutions : demande de suppression des lois oppressives, établissement immédiat d’un gouvernement autonome, convocation d’une conférence pour déterminer les principes d’une Constitution indienne, qui serait définitivement élaborée par la nouvelle Assemblée ; et mê
U||me, fédération des peuples asiatiques pour l’émancipation de l’Asie. Gandhi ne pouvait méconnaître ces leçons des faits nouveaux. Surtout, l’estime et l’affection qu’il avait pour les chefs de ce mouvement, comme C.-R. Das, dont il connaissait la sincérité et la foi éprouvée, lui imposaient de ne point condamner, sans un sérieux examen, cette déviation à ses principes de Non-coopération.
U||[158] C. F. Andrews, dans un article du Manchester Weekly (1er février), ajoute que ce succès était d’autant plus remarquable que le parti Swaraj n’avait reçu du Congrès national la permission de prendre part aux élections que peu de jours avant le scrutin. Un très grand nombre de Non-Coopérateurs, qui voulaient suivre strictement les principes de Gandhi, étaient restés à l’écart des élections. Si toute l’armée des Non-Coopérateurs s’était entendue pour l’action électorale, leur victoire eût été écrasante.
U||« Vous n’attendrez pas de moi, dit-il, une opinion sur la question délicate de l’élection des membres du Congrès aux Conseils législatifs et à l’Assemblée. Bien que je n’aie aucunement changé d’opinion sur le boycott des conseils, des tribunaux et des Écoles du gouvernement, je n’ai point de faits qui me permettent d’arriver à un jugement sur ces modifications de tactique. Je ne veux exprimer aucune opinion, avant d’avoir pu discuter avec nos illustres compatriotes qui, dans l’intérêt du pays, se sont crus tenus de recommander la cessation du boycott des corps législatifs. »
U||Il termine en affirmant, une fois de plus, qu’il ne combat pas les Anglais, mais leur gouvernement et leur système politique d’oppression.
U||Deux autres Messages, publiés au cours du mois de février, attestent que la maladie[159] ne peut avoir raison de son énergie, ni les efforts des médecins pour le tenir au repos ne sauraient l’empêcher d’accomplir son devoir de chef :
U||[159] Il s’en faut que, même à l’heure présente, Gandhi soit hors de danger. (Fin mars 1924.)
U||Le 16 février[160], il publie une Déclaration, au sujet des événements récents du Sud-Afrique, où le Parlement de l’Union examine un Class Areas Bill (Bill des enceintes de classes), parquant les Indiens dans d’étroites limites. Gandhi proteste contre cette violation des conventions signées en 1914, et refait toute l’histoire du mouvement Sud-Africain.
U||[160] Bengalee, Calcutta, 16 février.
U||Le 25 février[161], il adresse un message aux Sikhs Akalis, qui viennent d’entrer en collision avec la police britannique et de subir une sanglante fusillade, sur l’ordre d’un administrateur anglais. — Gandhi les rappelle strictement à la non-violence.
U||[161] Indian Daily News, Calcutta, 26 février.
U||Dirons-nous les transports de l’Inde, depuis la libération, — l’appel de Mohamed Ali, décrétant pour le 10 février un jour d’actions de grâces nationales, — l’union de toutes les confessions dans cet acte de remerciement religieux, — les meetings de 30.000 personnes à Bombay, — les grandes processions mahométanes, — les fêtes de toute l’Inde ? Des torrents d’amour se déversent sur Gandhi ; et les médecins ont beaucoup de peine à en préserver leur convalescent. Cet amour gagne jusqu’aux gardes qui le soignent, et aux Anglais mêmes : tel ce vieux retraité militaire de 82 ans, dont parle un journal anglais, et qui vient tous les deux jours à l’hôpital avec un bouquet de fleurs, entre sans qu’on puisse l’arrêter, serre chaleureusement la main au Mahatma, et s’en va, lui disant : « Allons, courage, mon vieux ! »
U||Lui, toujours paisible, maître de lui, s’obligeant à parler longuement aux visiteurs. Il est émacié, ratatiné : « Il semble à peine la moitié de lui-même… On a les larmes aux yeux en le voyant. » Mais qui l’entend parler, de sa voix douce et calme, avec son affectueuse courtoisie, est touché jusqu’au cœur de sa sérénité. Et qui, l’ayant déjà connu avant son emprisonnement, le revoit (comme ce jeune Parsi qui me racontait, ces jours derniers, sa visite à l’hôpital), est frappé du changement. Avant la prison, on le sentait, malgré sa force d’âme, attristé de soucis. Maintenant, il est toute lumière… « Une âme qui peut se dire vraiment en paix avec le monde[162]. »
U||[162] Dilip Kumar Roy — Combien j’aimerais à citer ici l’entretien que notre ami, le musicien hindou, D. K. Roy, eut le 2 février, à l’hôpital de Poona, avec Gandhi, sur la musique ! On y sent le grand cœur du Mahâtmâ, religieusement épris de la beauté de l’art, au point de « ne pas concevoir une évolution de la vie religieuse de l’Inde sans musique », mais comme les sages helléniques, et comme Gœthe, voyant le plus grand art dans la vie la plus belle. (The Bombay Chronicle, 5 février.)
U||Nous devons, une fois de plus, clore ce chapitre en pleine action, — nous réservant d’en suivre le récit, dans de nouvelles éditions du livre. Nous en restons, à l’heure où les Swarajstes indiens viennent de rejeter, à l’Assemblée, le budget proposé, — à titre de simple manifestation de principe, et afin d’avertir le gouvernement qu’il doit dorénavant compter avec eux. Ils attendent les propositions de l’Angleterre.
U||Ces propositions viendront-elles ? Et surtout, viendront-elles à temps ? Il ne semble pas que le ministère travailliste soit plus disposé que les précédents à accorder le Home Rule à l’Inde ; et le message de Ramsay Macdonald a déçu, non pas tant l’auteur de ce livre, qui n’a plus beaucoup d’illusions sur la politique européenne, — que de nombreux amis de l’Inde et de l’Angleterre. Nous reconnaissons que la question est tragique pour toutes les deux. L’Angleterre a ruiné l’Inde, à son profit. Mais si elle rendait à l’Inde l’indépendance politique et économique, ce serait aux ouvriers des manufactures de Manchester d’être ruinés à leur tour. Un Gandhi est des très rares hommes capables de s’élever au-dessus des intérêts d’un seul des partis en lutte et de vouloir chercher le bien de tous les deux. Mais il faut qu’en Angleterre il trouve des adversaires de sa hauteur et de sa compréhension. En sera-t-il ainsi ? Que le veuille le bon génie du peuple 
U||britannique !
U||En tout cas, l’Angleterre n’est plus portée à mésestimer la force de son adversaire et l’efficacité de l’arme qu’il emploie : la Non-Violence. Pour les politiques européens qui seraient tentés encore de méconnaître la valeur combative de celle-ci, je citerai, pour finir, ces extraits d’une étude du très intelligent et très positif journal libéral anglais, non suspect de sympathies gandhistes, le Manchester Guardian Weekly (15 février).
U||« Réfléchissons à la force extraordinaire de l’arme politique qui, dans les dernières années, est venue en usage, sous la forme de l’inertie absolue. La première démonstration dangereuse qui en ait été faite sur une grande échelle, le fut par les Suffragettes, dans leurs grèves de la faim. Le Sinn Fein était, primitivement, une organisation pour la résistance absolument passive ; elle traitait comme inexistant tout ce qui était anglais en Irlande : les tribunaux, les postes, le percepteur et l’agent de police… Aujourd’hui, le Punjab est le laboratoire où s’expérimente la force explosive de cet étrange et nouvel explosif, qui n’explose pas, mais qui peut mettre hors de combat. C’est une maxime libérale, que tout gouvernement doit reposer sur le consentement des gouvernés. Dans le monde moderne, même dans l’Inde, il commence à sembler que n’importe quel gouvernement peut être disloqué, si un nombre considérable de ses sujets s’organisent pour ne faire aucun ac
U||te positif afin de l’aider, — même pas de manger dans ses prisons. Le ministère de l’Intérieur était à bout de ressources, quand la guerre suspendit les grèves de la faim des femmes ; et le gouvernement du Penjab est-il bien sûr maintenant de ce qu’il doit faire ? Notre habitude à tous a été jusqu’ici de considérer la résistance purement passive, le simple refus d’accomplir même les rudiments de la coopération civique, comme une arme inévitablement inefficace, en dernier ressort, en face de la force accablante résolument employée. Bien que la question ne soit pas encore éclaircie, il est possible que nous ayons à réviser nos conceptions de la force politique, et à reconnaître dans des préceptes comme celui de « PRÉSENTER L’AUTRE JOUE » l’indication d’une action politique effective, et non pas simplement, comme a dit Bacon, un principe de « MORALITÉ ABSTRAITE ET MONACALE ».

U||Fin mars 1924.
U||L’auteur de ce livre, qu’il vient de reviser, après la cinquantième édition, d’après les notes de ses amis indiens, croit bon de résumer en quelques lignes les événements accomplis depuis 1924 dans le parti gandhiste, et la situation dans l’Inde, en juin 1926.
U||A sa sortie de prison, et après sa convalescence, Gandhi fut élu président du Congrès de toute l’Inde, pour l’année 1925. Sans modifier ses principes fondamentaux, et tout en se refusant personnellement à toute « coopération », il céda aux instances d’une section de Swarajstes, et, dans l’intérêt de la cause indienne, il permit à ceux de son parti qui le désiraient, de coopérer, en rentrant dans les Conseils législatifs du gouvernement anglo-indien. Il continua surtout à travailler pour le rétablissement de l’unité hindoue-musulmane (tâche difficile, car le gouvernement britannique fomente la discorde), à développer la fabrication du khaddar (tissu indigène), et à lutter contre l’intouchabilité : (ici, les gandhistes ont remporté une victoire signalée, dans l’État de Travancore).
U||A l’expiration de sa présidence, fin 1925, Gandhi fut remplacé par sa disciple, la poétesse hindoue, Mrs Sarojini Naïdu. Depuis, il a momentanément renoncé à l’activité politique directe. Retiré dans son Ashram (monastère) de Sabarmati, il se consacre à la méditation, à l’éducation des enfants, et à la direction des disciples, ainsi qu’à la propagande du khaddar. Il est un chef religieux, la plus haute autorité morale de l’Inde. Les chefs des partis Swarajstes viennent dans sa retraite lui demander conseil ; et dans ses deux revues : Navajiran et Young India, il fait entendre régulièrement sa voix, qui montre le chemin et maintient fermement les principes.

U||Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
U||Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
U||The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.

To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
U||While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
U||International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
U||Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
U||Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

U||[pg ix]DAWN OF A NEW ERA
U||Many critics and some friends of Mahatma Gandhi have found fault with his desire to introduce simpler methods of spinning and weaving and to do away with much of the complicated machinery of Modern Civilisation. The reason why they object is that they fear such methods mean not progress towards a higher state but relapse into a primitive condition of civilisation or even of barbarism. His denunciation of the age of machinery and of the Industrial System has been criticised by many as the ravings of a visionary and of one who is merely an impracticable idealist. This is a strange criticism to come from those who give their allegiance to a form of civilisation or 'Culture' which has led to the unprecedented horrors of the late European War and the century-old disgraces [pg x] of the Industrial System. Is this present modern civilisation so very desirable that we should wish it to continue in perpetuity? Every civilisation in the History of Man has reached a certain point after which there has been one possibil
U||ity only for it and that was absolute relapse into semi-darkness in order to give place to a new and higher civilisation. The common starting point of all the civilisations is a kind of night-time. In order that the Babylonian (or Despotic) Civilisation might give way to the Roman (or Heroic), and the Roman give way to the Modern (or Intellectual) Civilisation, it was necessary for each in turn to sink completely into this common night-time. Without this entire destruction of the ancient structure, there would have been only a patchwork of the old, and not a harmonious building of the New. As Christ said: "Ye cannot put old wine into new bottles." The debris of the Past has to be cleared away in order to make way for the structure of the Future. Now with regard to Modern Civilisation, all the signs of the times show that it has failed [pg xi] lamentably and is gradually tottering to a dishonoured grave. Why make any attempts to prop up what Nature so evidently has decided to throw on the scrap-heap? Such att
U||empts are contrary to the teaching of past history. But anything, which tends to reach the common roots of all civilisations, should be encouraged. In order that the spiritual civilisation of the Future may have a real chance of growing in an atmosphere congenial to it, Mahatma Gandhi's demonstration of the right path should be welcomed. His emphasis on simplicity of life and on the simplification of the machinery of living must be realised as a supremely essential condition of the coming of the new Era. In the civilisation of the Future, an Era of natural harmonious living will be inaugurated, and artificial, luxurious and pompous living will be entirely rooted out.
U||Simplicity of life being a condition of spiritual perfection, we may look forward to an Era of Civilisation in the Future, greatly superior to all the civilisations of the Past, if only we accept simplicity of [pg xii] life as the best method of living. The failure and decline of Western or Modern Civilisation need not alarm us; for the experience of History is full of similar declines of once powerful cultures. When Babylonian Civilisation had reached its height, it had to come down to what we may term the zero-point of all civilisation from which Roman Civilisation had made its start. But when Roman Civilisation had reached its zenith, it was much superior to the zenith Civilisation of Babylon, as the zenith Babylonian was superior to the zero-civilisation. And so also of full-fledged Modern Civilisation. We may say that until it returns to the common zero-point, there is no hope of a full and perfect development of a civilisation moulded by spiritual ideals.
U||Let critics of Mahatma Gandhi then look to History before they condemn him for trying to bring this much belauded Modern Civilisation down to the common starting point of all great civilisations. We are at the dawn of a New Era, and Mahatma Gandhi is the one leader who shows to us the right [pg xiii] path. He at least is watering the roots, while all others who try to keep alive the Civilisation of the Western nations are like foolish gardeners who lavish water on the withering leaves of a dying tree and never think of watering its roots.

U||Mr. Kasturi Ranga Aiyangar was pleased to answer my argument in favour of the details of the first stage of non-co-operation that I had the honour of explaining at the great Madras Beach meeting. He expressed his dissent from all but the renunciation of titles. He suggested boycott of foreign goods in the place of the other items. Even at the risk of repeating arguments familiar to the readers of "Young India", I must deal with the question of boycott which has now received the imprimatur of so able a publicist as Mr. Kasturi Ranga Aiyangar.
U||[pg 002]In the first place, boycott of British goods has been conceived as a punishment and can have no place in non-co-operation which is conceived in a spirit of self-sacrifice and is a matter of sacred duty.
U||Secondly, any measure of punishment must be swift, certain and adequate for the effect intended to be produced. Resorted to by individuals, therefore, boycott is ineffectual, for, it can give no satisfaction unless it is productive of effect, whereas every act of non-co-operation is its own satisfaction.
U||Thirdly, boycott of British goods is thoroughly unpractical, for, it involves sacrifice of their millions by millionaires. It is in my opinion infinitely more difficult for a merchant to sacrifice his millions than for a lawyer to suspend his practice or for a title-holder to give up his title or for a parent to sacrifice, if need be, the literary instruction of his children. Add to this the important fact that merchants have only lately begun to interest themselves in politics. They are therefore yet timid and cautious. But the class, to [pg 003] which the first stage of non-co-operation is intended to appeal, is the political class which has devoted years to politics and is not mentally unprepared for communal sacrifice.
U||Boycott of British goods to be effective must be taken up by the whole country at once or not at all. It is like a siege. You can carry out a siege only when you have the requisite men and instruments of destruction. One man scratching a wall with his finger nails may hurt his fingers but will produce no effect upon the walls. One title-holder giving up his title has the supreme satisfaction of having washed his hands clean of the guilt of the donor and is unaffected by the refusal of his fellows to give up theirs. The motive of boycott being punitive lacks the inherent practicability of non-co-operation. The spirit of punishment is a sign of weakness. A strengthening of that spirit will retard the process of regeneration. The spirit of sacrifice is a determination to rid ourselves of our weakness. It is therefore an invigorating and purifying process and is [pg 004] therefore also calculated to do good both to us and to those who evoke the spirit of sacrifice in us. Above all, if India has a mission of her 
U||own, she will not fulfil it by copying the doubtful example of the West and making even her sacrifice materialistically utilitarian instead of offering a sacrifice spotless and pleasing even in the sight of God.
U||KHILAFAT AND SWADESHI[pg 005]
U||It was not without much misgiving that I consented to include Swadeshi as a plank in non-co-operation. But Maulana Hasrat Mohani by his sheer earnestness bore me down. I fear however that his reasons for including Swadeshi are different from mine. He is a protagonist of boycott of British goods, I cannot reconcile myself to the doctrine as I have explained elsewhere in this issue. But having failed to popularise boycott, Mohani Saheb has accepted Swadeshi as the lesser good. It is however necessary for me to explain how I have come to include Swadeshi in the programme of non-co-operation.
U||Non-co-operation is nothing but discipline in self-sacrifice. And I believe that a nation that is capable of limitless sacrifice is capable of rising to limitless heights. The purer the sacrifice the quicker the progress. Swadeshi offers every man, woman [pg 006] and child an occasion to make a beginning in self-sacrifice of a pure type. It therefore presents an opportunity for testing our capacity for sacrifice. It is the measure for gauging the depth of national feeling on the Khilafat wrong. Does the nation feel sufficiently to move it to go through even the preliminary process of sacrifice? Will the nation revise its taste for the Japanese silk, the Manchester calico or the French lace and find all its decoration out of hand-spun and hand-woven cloth, i.e., Khadi? If crores of people will refuse to wear or use foreign cloth and be satisfied with the simple cloth that we can produce in our homes, it will be proof of our organising ability, energy, co-operation and self-sacrifice that will enable us to sec
U||ure all we need. It will be a striking demonstration of national solidarity.
U||Such a consummation cannot be achieved for the mere wish. It cannot be achieved by one man, no matter how capable and sincere he may be. It cannot be achieved by dotting India with Swadeshi stores. It can only be achieved by new production [pg 007] and judicious distribution. Production means lacs of women spinning in their own homes. This requires earnest men to be engaged in honestly distributing carded cotton and collecting yarn and paying for it. It means manufacture of thousands of spinning wheels. It means inducing the hereditary weavers to return to their noble calling and distributing home-spun yarn amongst them and selling their manufactures. It is thus only as an energising agent that I can think of Swadeshi as a plank in non-co-operation. But it is not to be despised in that capacity. And I hope that every worker for the cause, even if he can do nothing else, will have done something if he can advance Swadeshi first by increasing production and then distribution. He would be simply moving in a cir
U||cle if he is satisfied with distributing cloth that is already being manufactured in India.
U||[pg 008]THE SECRET OF SWARAJ
U||The Congress resolution has rightly emphasised the importance of Swadeshi and the amount of greater sacrifice by merchants.
U||India cannot be free so long as India voluntarily encourages or tolerates the economic drain which has been going on for the past century and a half. Boycott of foreign goods means no more and no less than boycott of foreign cloth. Foreign cloth constitutes the largest drain voluntarily permitted by us. It means sixty crores of rupees annually paid by us for piece-goods. If India could make a successful effort to stop that drain, she can gain Swaraj by that one act.
U||India was enslaved for satisfying the greed of the foreign cloth manufacturer. When the East India Company came in, we were able to manufacture all the cloth [pg 009] we needed, and more for export. By processes that need not be described here, India has become practically wholly dependent upon foreign manufacture for her clothing.
U||But we ought not to be dependent. India has the ability to manufacture all her cloth if her children will work for it. Fortunately India has yet enough weavers to supplement the out-turn of her mills. The mills do not and cannot immediately manufacture all the cloth we want. The reader may not know that, even at the present moment, the weavers weave more cloth than the mills. But the latter weave five crore yards of fine foreign counts, equal to forty crore yards of coarser counts. The way to carry out a successful boycott of foreign cloth is to increase the out-put of yarn. And this can only be done by hand-spinning.
U||To bring about such a boycott, it is necessary for our merchants to stop all foreign importation, and to sell out, even at a loss, all foreign cloth already stocked in India, preferably to foreign buyers. They [pg 010] must cease to speculate in cotton, and keep all the cotton required for home use. They must stop purchasing all foreign cotton.
U||The mill-owners should work their mills not for their profits but as a national trust and therefore cease to spin finer counts, and weave only for the home market.
U||The householder has to revise his or her ideas of fashion and, at least for the time being, suspend the use of fine garments which are not always worn to cover the body. He should train himself to see art and beauty in the spotlessly white khaddar and to appreciate its soft unevenness. The householder must learn to use cloth as a miser uses his hoard.
U||And even when the householders have revised their tastes about dress, somebody will have to spin yarn for the weavers. This can only be done by every one spinning during spare hours either for love or money.
U||We are engaged in a spiritual war. We are not living in normal times. Normal activities are always suspended in abnormal times. And if we are out to gain [pg 011] Swaraj in a year's time, it means that we must concentrate upon our goal to the exclusion of every thing else. I therefore venture to suggest to the students all over India to suspend their normal studies for one year and devote their time to the manufacture of yarn by hand-spinning. It will be their greatest act of service to the motherland, and their most natural contribution to the attainment of Swaraj. During the late war our rulers attempted to turn every factory into an arsenal for turning out bullets of lead. During this war of ours, I suggest every national school and college being turned into a factory for preparing cones of yarns for the nation. The students will lose nothing by the occupation: they will gain a kingdom here and hereafter. There is a famine of cloth in India. To assist in removing this dearth is surely an act of merit. If 
U||it is sinful to use foreign yarn, it is a virtue to manufacture more Swadeshi yarn in order to enable us to cope with the want that would be created by the disuse of foreign yarn.
U||The obvious question asked would be, if [pg 012] it is so necessary to manufacture yarn, why not pay every poor person to do so? The answer is that hand spinning is not, and never was, a calling like weaving, carpentry, etc. Under the pre-British economy of India, spinning was an honourable and leisurely occupation for the women of India. It is difficult to revive the art among the women in the time at our disposal. But it is incredibly simple and easy for the school-goers to respond to the nation's call. Let no one decry the work as being derogatory to the dignity of man or students. It was an art confined to the women of India because the latter had more leisure. And being graceful, musical, and as it did not involve any great exertion, it had become the monopoly of women. But it is certainly as graceful for either sex as is music for instance. In hand-spinning is hidden the protection of women's virtue, the insurance against famine, and the cheapening of prices. In it is hidden the secret of Swaraj. The r
U||evival of hand spinning is the least penance we must do for the sin of our forefathers [pg 013] in having succumbed to the satanic influences of the foreign manufacturer.
U||The school-goers will restore hand-spinning to its respectable status. They will hasten the process of making Khaddar fashionable. For no mother, or father, worth the name will refuse to wear cloth made out of yarn spun by their children. And the scholars' practical recognition of art will compel the attention of the weavers of India. If we are to wean the Punjabi from the calling not of a soldier but of the murderer of innocent and free people of other lands, we must give back to him the occupation of weaving. The race of the peaceful Julahis of the Punjab is all but extinct. It is for the scholars of the Punjab to make it possible for the Punjabi weaver to return to his innocent calling.
U||I hope to show in a future issue how easy it is to introduce this change in the schools and how quickly, on these terms, we can nationalise our schools and colleges. Everywhere the students have asked me what new things I would introduce into our nationalised schools. I have invariably [pg 014] told them I would certainly introduce spinning. I feel, so much more clearly than ever before that during the transition period, we must devote exclusive attention to spinning and certain other things of immediate national use, so as to make up for past neglect. And the students will be better able and equipped to enter upon the new course of studies.
U||Do I want to put back the hand of the clock of progress? Do I want to replace the mills by hand-spinning and hand-weaving? Do I want to replace the railway by the country cart? Do I want to destroy machinery altogether? These questions have been asked by some journalists and public men. My answer is: I would not weep over the disappearance of machinery or consider it a calamity. But I have no design upon machinery as such. What I want to do at the present moment is to supplement the production of yarn and cloth through our mills, save the millions we send out of India, and distribute them in our cottages. This I cannot do unless and until the nation is prepared to devote [pg 015] its leisure hours to hand-spinning. To that end we must adopt the methods I have ventured to suggest for popularising spinning as a duty rather than as a means of livelihood.
U||SWADESHI[pg 016]
U||In criticising my article entitled 'The Music of the Spinning Wheel!' the "Leader" the other day attributed to me the ideas that I have never entertained. And it is necessary for the purpose of understanding the true value of Swadeshi, to correct some of the current fallacies. The Leader considers that I am putting back the hands of the clock of progress by attempting to replace mill-made cloth and mill-spun yarn by hand-woven and hand-spun yarn. Now, I am making no such attempt at all. I have no quarrel with the mills. My views are incredibly simple. India requires nearly 13 yards of cloth per head per year. She produces, I believe, less than half the amount. India grows all the cotton she needs. She exports several million bales of cotton to Japan and Lancashire and receives much of it back in [pg 017] manufactured calico although she is capable of producing all the cloth and all the yarn necessary for supplying her wants by hand-weaving and hand-spinning. India needs to supplement her main occupation, agr
U||iculture, with some other employment. Hand-spinning is the only such employment for millions. It was the national employment a century ago. It is not true to say that economic pressure and modern machinery destroyed hand-spinning and hand-weaving. This great industry was destroyed or almost destroyed by extraordinary and immoral means adopted by the East India Company. This national industry is capable of being revived by exertion and a change in the national taste without damaging the mill industry. Increase of mills is no present remedy for supplying the deficiency. The difficulty can be easily supplied only by hand-spinning and hand-weaving. If this employment were revived, it would prevent sixty million rupees from being annually drained from the country and distribute the amount among lacs of poor women in their own [pg 018] cottages. I therefore consider Swadeshi as an automatic, though partial, solution of the problem of India's grinding poverty. It also constitutes a ready-made insurance policy in ti
U||mes of scarcity of rain.
U||But two things are needful to bring about the needed revival—to create a taste for Khaddar and to provide an organisation for the distribution of carded cotton and collection of yarn against payment.
U||In one year, by the silent labour of a few men, several thousand rupees have been distributed in Gujarat among several thousand poor women who are glad enough to earn a few pice per day to buy milk for their children, etc.
U||The argument does not apply to the sugar industry as the "Leader" has attempted. There is not sufficient cane grown in India to supply India's wants. Sugar was never a national and supplementary industry. Foreign sugar has not supplanted Indian sugar. India's wants of sugar have grown and she therefore imports more sugar. But this importation does not institute a drain in the sense in which importation of [pg 019] foreign cloth does. Production of more sugar means more scientific agriculture, more and better machinery for crushing and refining. The sugar industry therefore stands on a different platform. Swadeshi in sugar is desirable, Swadeshi in cloth is an urgent necessity.
U||The Swadeshi propaganda has been going on in a more or less organised manner now for the past eighteen months. Some of its results are surprising and gratifying. It has taken a fairly firm hold in the Punjab, Madras and the Bombay Presidency. Hand spinning and hand-weaving are steadily increasing in these parts. Several thousand rupees have been distributed in homes where women never did any work before. And if more work of this kind has not been done, it is due to want of workers.
U||This is however written more to note the mistakes of the past than to sum up the bright side. My observations lead me to the conclusion that whilst the inauguration of the three vows and Swadeshi stores have greatly stimulated the Swadeshi [pg 020] spirit, it is no longer possible to advocate the taking of any of the three vows or the opening of new Swadeshi stores for the sale of mill-made cloth. The result of the propaganda has been to send up the prices of yarn and cloth rather than increase production. It is clear that the purpose of Swadeshi is not served until the quantity of yarn and cloth produced is increased. The gain therefore is merely moral and not material. The people have begun to perceive the desirability of wearing only Swadeshi cloth if the real interest of the country is to be advanced.
U||But it is clear that we must take practical steps for meeting the growing demand for Swadeshi cloth. One way, no doubt, is to increase the mills. But it is obvious that capitalists do not need popular encouragement. They know that India needs much more cloth than is manufactured by our mills. But mills do not spring up like mushrooms. It is a matter of getting machinery from outside, let alone the difficulty of getting labour. And after all, India cannot become truly and economically [pg 021] independent so long as she must rely on the supply of machinery from outside for the manufacture of her cloth.
U||The cleanest and the most popular form of Swadeshi, therefore, is to stimulate hand-spinning and hand-weaving and to arrange for a judicious distribution of yarn and cloth so manufactured. With a little talent and a little industry this thing is easy. Even as each home cooks its own food without difficulty, so may each home weave its own yarn. And just as in spite of every home having its own kitchen, restaurants continue to flourish, so will mills continue to supply our additional wants. But even as because of our private kitchens we would not starve if every restaurant was through some accident closed, so would we, by reason of domestic spinning, not have to be naked even if every mill, by a blockade from the west, had to stop work. Not long ago, we knew this secret of our own economic independence and it is possible for us to regain that independence by a little effort, a little organising agency and a little sacrifice.
U||[pg 022]Therefore true Swadeshi consists in introducing the spinning wheel in every household and every household spinning its own yarn. Many a Punjabi woman does it to-day. And though we may not supply our own cloth entirely, we shall be saving yearly crores of rupees. In any event there is no other Swadeshi than increased manufacture by hand-spinning and hand-weaving. Whether we take up hand-spinning and hand-weaving or we do not, it is at least necessary to understand what true Swadeshi is.
U||How to kill swadeshi—We are familiar with the official ban put upon the Khadi cap in various parts of India. In Bihar, I heard that a magistrate actually sent hawkers to sell foreign cloth. Mr. Painter of Dharwar fame has gone one better, and has issued an official circular in which he says:
U||"All officers subordinate to the Collector and District Magistrate are desired to take steps to make people realise, that in as much as India produces less than her population requires, a boycott of foreign [pg 023] cloth and its destruction or export must inevitably lead to a serious rise in prices, which may lead to a serious disorder and looting, and that these consequences will be the result, not of any action on the part of Government but of Mr. Gandhi's campaign."
U||In two other paragraphs means are indicated of combating the Swadeshi propaganda i.e. by holding meetings, and by dealers who are opposed to boycott attending the Collector's office at stated hours. The Madras Government have issued a still more pedantic circular. The meaning of these circulars is obvious. Pressure is to be put upon the dealers and others not to countenance boycott. The subordinate officials will take liberties which the authors of circulars may not even have contemplated. Fortunately for the country, these threats now produce little or no impression upon the public, and the Swadeshi movement will go on in the teeth of the official opposition, be it secret or open, unscrupulous or honourable.
U||[pg 024]The officials are so ignorant and obstinate, that they will not take the only effective course for avoiding the feared 'disorders and looting,' viz. making common cause with the public and stimulating production. Instead of recognising the agitation against foreign cloth as desirable and necessary, they regard it as an evil to be put down. And then it is complained, that I call a system which seeks to thwart healthy public agitation, satanic. Why should there be any dearth of indigenous cloth? Is there not enough cotton in India? Are there not enough men and women who can spin and weave? Is it not possible to manufacture all the required number of wheels in a few days? Why should not each home manufacture its own cloth, even as it cooks its own food? Is it not enough in times of famine to distribute uncooked grain among the famine-striken? Why should it not be enough to distribute raw cotton among those who need clothing? Why this hypocritical or false alarm about the dearth of cloth, when it is poss
U||ible in India to [pg 025] manufacture enough for India's needs in a month even without the aid of the mills? The people have been purposely or ignorantly kept in the dark hitherto. They have been wrongly taught to believe, that all the cloth needed cannot be manufactured in India's homes as of yore. They have been figuratively amputated and then made to rely upon foreign or mill-made cloth. I wish the people concerned will give the only dignified answer possible to these circulars. They will forthwith burn or send out all their foreign cloth, and courageously make up their minds to spin and weave for their own requirements. It is incredibly easy for every one who is not an idler.
U||Y. I.—18th Aug, 1920.
U||SWADESHI IN THE PUNJAB[pg 026]
U||The Joint Secretaries of the Bharat Stri Maha Mandal, Punjab Branch, send a report of the Swadeshi activities of Shrimati Saraladevi Chaudhrani ever since her return to Lahore from Bombay. Miss Roy and Mrs. Roshandal, the Secretaries, state that meetings of women were held respectively on the 23rd, 24th and 25th June at three different places in Lahore. All the meetings were attended by hundreds of women who were deeply interested in what Shrimati Saraladevi had to say. The burden of her discourses was India's deep poverty. She traced the causes and proved that our poverty was primarily due to the abandonment of Swadeshi by the people. The remedy therefore lay in reverting to Swadeshi.
U||Saraladevi herself writes to say that her Khaddar Sari impressed her audiences [pg 027] more than her speeches, and her songs came next, her speeches last. The good ladies of Lahore flocked round her and felt her coarse but beautifully white Sari and admired it. Some took pity on her that she who only the other day was dressed in costly thin silk Saris now decked herself in hand-woven Swadeshi Khaddar. Saraladevi wanted no pity and retorted that their thin foreign scarves lay heavier on their shoulders with the weight of their helpless dependence on foreign manufacture whereas her coarse Khaddar lay light as a feather on her body with the joy of the knowledge that she was free because she wore garments in the manufacture of which her sisters and her brothers had laboured. This statement so pleased her audience that most of the women present resolved to discard foreign clothes. Saraladevi has now been charged by these ladies to open a shop where they could buy Swadeshi goods. She has since addressed more audi
U||ences. She spoke at the District Conference at Sialkot and to a meeting exclusively devoted to ladies numbering over [pg 028] one thousand. I hope that the men of Punjab will help Saraladevi in her self-imposed mission. They may harness her talents and her willingness in founding Swadeshi Sabha and organising Swadeshi propaganda on a sound basis. Both men and money are needed to make the work a success.
U||Swadeshi is more than reforms. There is much waste over reforms. There is none in Swadeshi. Every yard of yarn spun is so much labour well spent and so much wealth added to the national treasury. Every drop counts. Swadeshi spells first production and then distribution. Distribution without production means the raising of prices without any corresponding benefit. For to-day demand exceeds the supply. If we will not manufacture more cloth, more foreign imports must continue a painful and sinful necessity.
U||Punjab has a great opportunity. Punjab grows splendid cotton. The art of spinning has not yet died out. Almost every Punjabi woman knows it. This sacred haunt of the Rishis of old has thousands of weavers. [pg 029] Only the leaders need to have faith in their women and themselves. When Saraladevi wrote to me that she might want goods from Bombay, I felt hurt. The Punjab has all the time and all the labour and the material necessary for producing her own cloth. She has brave merchants. She has more than enough capital. She has brains. Has she the will? She can organise her own Swadeshi in less than a year, if the leaders will work at this great cause. It is playing with Swadeshi for the Punjab to have to import cloth from Bombay.
U||The Punjab has to right herself by putting her Swadeshi on a proper basis and by ridding herself of Messrs. Bosworth Smith and Company. She will then be both economically and politically sound. Geographically she stands at the top. She led the way in the older times. Will she again do so? Her men are virile to look at. Have they virility enough to secure without a moment's delay purity of administration? I have not strayed from Swadeshi to politics. My Swadeshi spirit makes me impatient of garments that [pg 030] denude India of her wealth and equally impatient of the Smiths, the O'Briens, the Shri Rams and the Maliks who denude her of her self-respect and insolently touch women's veils with their sticks, chain innocent men as if they were beasts, or shoot them from armoured cars or otherwise terrorise people into subjection.
U||Y. I.—7th July 1920.
U||SWADESHI STORES[pg 031]
U||In a previous issue I endeavoured to show how stores for the sake of selling mill-manufactures did not advance Swadeshi in any way whatsoever but on the contrary, tended to send up the price of cloth. I propose to show in this article how with a small capital, it is possible to advance true Swadeshi and earn a modest livelihood.
U||Suppose that there is a family consisting of husband, wife and two children one of whom is ten years old and the other five. If they have a capital of Rs. 500 they can manage a Khaddar Bhandar in a small way. They can hire, say in a place with a population of 20,000 inhabitants a shop with dwelling rooms for Rs. 10 per month. If they sell the whole of the stock at 10 p.c. profit they can have Rs. 50 per month. They have no servants. The wife and the [pg 032] children in their spare time would be expected to help in keeping the shop tidy and looking after it when the husband is out. The wife and children can also devote their spare time to spinning.
U||In the initial stages the Khaddar may not sell at the shop. In that case the husband is expected to hawk the Khaddar from door to door and popularise it. He will soon find a custom for it.
U||The reader must not be surprised at my suggesting 10 p.c. profits. The Khaddar Bhandars are not designed for the poorest. The use of Khaddar saves at least half the cost not necessarily because the Khaddar is more durable (though that it certainly is) but because its use revolutionises our tastes. I know what saving of money its use has meant to me. Those, who buy Khaddar from patriotic motives merely, can easily afford to pay 10 p.c. profits on Khaddar. Lastly the popularising of Khaddar means much care, devotion and labour. And the owner of a Khaddar Bhandar does not buy it at a wholesale shop but he must wander to get the best [pg 033] Khaddar, he must meet the local weavers and induce them to weave hand spun yarn. He must stimulate in his own district hand spinning among its women. He must come in touch with the carders and get them to card cotton. All this means intelligence, organisation and great ability. A man who can exhibit these qualities has a right to take 10 p.c. profits. And a Swadeshi Bhandar
U|| conducted on these lines becomes a true centre of Swadeshi activity. I commend my remarks to the attention of the managers of Swadeshi stores that are already in existence. They may not revolutionise their method at once but I have no doubt that they will advance Swadeshi only to the extent that they sell Khaddar.
U||Y. I.—7th July, 1920.
U||INDIAN ECONOMICS[pg 034]
U||A friend has placed in my hands a bulletin on Indian Piece Goods Trade prepared by Mr. A. C. Coubrough C. B. E. by order of the Government of India. It contains the following prefatory note: 'The Government of India desire it to be understood that the statements made and the views expressed in this bulletin are those of the author himself.' If so, why has the Government of India burdened the tax-payer with the expense of such bulletins? The one before me is 16th in the series. Do they publish both the sides of the question?
U||The bulletin under review is intended to be an answer to the Swadeshi movement. It is an elaborate note containing a number of charts showing the condition of imports and home manufacture of piece goods including hand-woven. But it does not assist the reader in studying the movement. [pg 035] The painstaking author has bestowed no pains upon a study of the present movement or its scope. That the Government of India treats the greatest constructive and co-operative movement in the country with supreme contempt and devotes people's money to a vain refutation instead of a sympathetic study and treatment is perhaps the best condemnation that can be pronounced upon the system under which it is carried.
U||The author's argument is:
U||(1) The movement if successful will act not as a protective but a prohibitive tariff.
U||(2) This must result in merely enriching the Indian capitalist and punishing the consumer.
U||(3) The imports are non-competitive in that the bulk of the kind of piece goods imported are not manufactured in India.
U||(4) The result of boycotting such piece goods must be high prices without corresponding benefit.
U||(5) The boycott therefore being against the law of supply and demand and against the consumer must fail in the end.
U||[pg 036](6) The destruction of hand spinning which I have deplored is due to natural causes, viz. the invention of time-saving appliances and was therefore inevitable.
U||(7) The Indian farmer is responsible for his own ruin in that he has indolently neglected cotton culture which was once so good.
U||(8) The best service I can render is therefore to induce the agriculturist to improve the quality of cotton.
U||(9) The author concludes, 'If instead of filling homes with useless Charkhas he were to start a propaganda for the more intensive cultivation of cotton and particularly for the production of longer staple cotton, his influence would be felt not only at the present day but for many generations to come.'
U||The reader will thus see, that what I regard as the supreme necessity for the economical salvation of India, the author considers to be rank folly. There is therefore no meeting ground here. And in spite of the prefatory note of the Government of India reproduced by me, the author does [pg 037] represent the Government attitude. I have invited them and the co-operators definitely to make common cause with the people in this movement at any rate. They may not mind its political implications because they do not believe in them. And surely they need not feel sorry if contrary to their expectation, the rise of the Charkha results in an increase in the political power of the people. Instead of waging war against Khadi, they might have popularised its use and disarmed the terrible suspicion they labour under of wishing to benefit the foreign manufacturer at the expense of the Indian cultivator. My invitation is open for all time. I prophesy that whatever happens to the other parts of the national programme, Swades
U||hi in its present shape will bide for ever and must if India's pauperism is to be banished.
U||Even though I am a layman, I make bold to say that the so-called laws laid down in books on economics are not immutable like the laws of Medes and Persians, nor are they universal. The economics of England are different from those of Germany. [pg 038] Germany enriched herself by bounty-fed beet sugar. England enriched herself by exploiting foreign markets. What was possible for a compact area is not possible for an area 1,900 miles long and 1,500 broad. The economics of a nation are determined by its climatic, geological and temperamental conditions. The Indian conditions are different from the English in all these essentials. What is meat for England is in many cases poison for India. Beef tea in the English climate may be good, it is poison for the hot climate of religious India. Fiery whisky in the north of the British Isles may be a necessity, it renders an Indian unfit for work or society. Fur-coats in Scotland are indispensable, they will be an intolerable burden in India. Free trade for a country whic
U||h has become industrial, whose population can and does live in cities, whose people do not mind preying upon other nations and therefore sustain the biggest navy to protect their unnatural commerce, may be economically sound (though as the reader perceives, I question its morality). Free trade for India has [pg 039] proved her curse and held her in bondage.
U||And now for Mr. Coubrough's propositions.
U||(1) The movement is intended to serve the purpose of a voluntary prohibitive tariff.
U||(2) But it is so conceived as neither unduly to benefit the capitalist nor to injure the consumer. During the very brief transition stage the prices of home manufactures may be, as they are, inflated. But the rise can only be temporary as the vast majority of consumers must become their own manufacturers. This cottage manufacture of yarn and cloth cannot be expensive even as domestic cookery is not expensive and cannot be replaced by hotel cookery. Over twenty-five crores of the population will be doing their own hand-spinning and having yarn thus manufactured woven in neighbouring localities. This population is rooted to the soil and has at least four months in the year to remain idle.
U||If they spin during those hours and have the yarn woven and wear it, no mill-made [pg 040] cloth can compete with their Khadi. The cloth thus manufactured will be the cheapest possible for them. If the rest of the population did not take part in the process, it could easily be supplied out of the surplus manufactured by the twenty-five crores.
U||(3) It is true that non-competitive imports are larger than those that compete with the manufactures of Indian mills. In the scheme proposed by me the question does not arise, because the central idea is not so much to carry on a commercial war against foreign countries as to utilise the idle hours of the nation and thus by natural processes to help it to get rid of her growing pauperism.
U||(4) I have already shown that the result of boycott cannot in the end be a rise in the price of cloth.
U||(5) The proposed boycott is not against the law of supply and demand, because it does away with the law by manufacturing enough for the supply. The movement does require a change of taste on the part of those who have adopted finer variety [pg 041] and who patronise fantastic combinations of colours and designs.
U||(6) I have shown in these pages, that the destruction of hand-spinning was designed and carried out in a most inhuman manner by the agents of the East India Company. No amount of appliances would ever have displaced this national art and industry but for this artificial and systematically cruel manner of carrying out the destruction.
U||(7) I am unable to hold the Indian farmer responsible for the deterioration in cotton culture. The whole incentive was taken away when hand-spinning was destroyed. The State never cared for the cultivator.
U||(8) My activity, I am proud to think, has already turned the cultivator's attention to the improvement of cotton. The artistic sense of the nation will insist on fine counts for which long staple is a necessity. Cotton culture by itself cannot solve the problem of India's poverty. For it will still leave the question of enforced idleness untouched.
U||[pg 042](9) I therefore claim for the Charkha the honour of being able to solve the problem of economic distress in a most natural, simple, unexpensive and business-like manner. The Charkha, therefore, is not only not useless as the writer ignorantly suggests, but it is a useful and indispensable article for every home. It is the symbol of the nation's prosperity and therefore, freedom. It is a symbol not of commercial war but of commercial peace. It bears not a message of ill-will towards the nations of the earth but of good-will and self-help. It will not need the protection of a navy threatening a world's peace and exploiting its resources, but it needs the religious determination of millions to spin their yarn in their own homes as to-day they cook their food in their own homes. I may deserve the curses of posterity for many mistakes of omission and commission but I am confident of earning its blessings for suggesting a revival of the Charkha. I stake my all on it. For every revolution of the wheel spins
U|| peace, good-will and love. And with all [pg 043] that, inasmuch as the loss of it brought about India's slavery, its voluntary revival with all its implications must mean India's freedom.
U||Y. I.—8th Dec. 1921.
U||HOW TO BOYCOTT FOREIGN CLOTH[pg 044]
U||It is needless to say at this time of the day, that the proposed boycott of foreign cloth is not a vindictive measure, but is as necessary for national existence as breath is for life. The quicker, therefore, it can be brought about, the better for the country. Without it, Swaraj cannot be established or retained after establishment. It is of the highest importance to know how it can be brought about even before the first day of August next.
U||To arrive at the boycott quickly, it is necessary (1) for the mill-owners to regulate their profits and to manufacture principally for the Indian market, (2) for importers to cease to buy foreign goods. A beginning has already been made by three principal merchants, (3) for the consumers to refuse to buy any foreign cloth and to buy Khadi wherever possible, (4) for the [pg 045] consumers to wear only Khadi cloth, mill cloth being retained for the poor who do not know the distinction between Swadeshi and Pardeshi, (5) for the consumers to use, till Swaraj is established and Khadi manufacture increased, Khadi just enough for covering the body, (6) for the consumers to destroy Pardeshi cloth, as they would destroy intoxicating liquors on taking the vow of abstinence, or to sell it for use abroad, or to wear it out for all dirty work or during private hours.
U||It is to be hoped that all the parties referred to in the foregoing clauses will respond well and simultaneously. But in the end success depends upon the persistent determination of the consumer. He has simply to decline to wear the badge of his slavery.
U||Abusing the khaddar—A friend draws attention to the fact that many who have adopted the khaddar costume are using it as a passport for arrogance, insolence, and, what is worse, fraud. He says that they have neither the spirit of non-co-operation in them nor the spirit of truth. They [pg 046] simply use the khaddar dress as a cloak for their deceit. All this is likely, especially during the transition stage, i.e., whilst khaddar is beginning to become fashionable. I would only suggest to my correspondent that such abuse of khaddar must not even unconsciously be allowed to be used as an argument against its use. Its use to-day is obligatory on those who believe that there is not sufficient Indian mill-made cloth to supply the wants of the nation, that the wants must be supplied in the quickest way possible by increasing home manufacture, and that such manufacture is possible only by making home-spinning universal. The use of khaddar represents nothing more than a most practical recognition of the greatest ec
U||onomic necessity of the country. Even a scoundrel may recognise this necessity, and has therefore a perfect right to wear it. And if a Government spy wore it to deceive people, I would welcome his use of khaddar as so much economic gain to the country. Only I would not give the wearer of the khaddar more than his due. [pg 047] And I would therefore not ascribe to him any piety or special virtue. It follows, therefore, that co-operationists or government servants may wear khaddar without incurring the danger of being mistaken for non-co-operationists. We may no more shun khaddar, than a devout church-goer may renounce his church because bad characters go to it for duping gullible people. I recall the name of an M. P. who successfully cloaked many of his vices by pretending to be a staunch temperance man. Not very long ago a bold and unscrupulous speculator found entry into most respectable circles by becoming a temperance advocate. Well has a poet said that 'hypocricy is an ode to virtue.'
U||Some 'ifs'—If you are a weaver feeling for the country, the Khilafat and the Punjab,
U||(1) You should weave only hand-spun yarn, and charge so as to give you a living. You should overcome all the difficulties of sizing and adjusting your loom to the requirements of coarse yarn.
U||(2) If you cannot possibly tackle hand-spun [pg 048] yarn for warp, you must use Indian mill-spun yarn for it and use hand-spun for woof.
U||(3) Where even the second alternative is not possible, you should use mill-spun yarn for both warp and woof.
U||But you should henceforth cease to use any foreign yarn, whether it is silk or cotton.
U||If you are a Congress official or worker, you should get hold of the weavers within your jurisdiction, and place the foregoing propositions before them for acceptance and help them to the best of your ability.
U||If you are a buyer, insist upon the first class of cloth, but if you have not the sense or the courage to do so, take up the second or the third, but on no account purchase foreign cloth or cloth woven in India but made of foreign yarn.
U||If you are a householder,
U||(1) You should make a fixed determination henceforth not to buy any foreign cloth.
U||(2) You should interview the weaver in your neighbourhood, and get him to weave [pg 049] for you enough khadi out of home-spun and failing that to weave out of Indian mill-spun yarn.
U||(3) You should deliver to the Congress Committee all your foreign cloth for destruction or sending to Smyrna or elsewhere outside India.
U||(4) If you have not the courage to give up your foreign cloth, you may wear it out at home for all dirty work, but never go out in foreign cloth.
U||(5) If you have any leisure, you should devote it to learning the art of spinning even, properly-twisted yarn for the sake of the nation.
U||If you are a schoolboy or schoolgirl, you should consider it a sin to receive literary training, before you have spun, carded or woven for the nation for at least four hours per day till the establishment of Swaraj.
U||Y. I.—6th July 1921.
U||SPINNING[pg 051]
U||THE MUSIC OF THE SPINNING WHEEL[pg 053]
U||Slowly but surely the music of perhaps the most ancient machine of India is once more permeating society. Pandit Malaviyaji has stated that he is not going to be satisfied until the Ranis and the Maharanis of India spin yarn for the nation, and the Ranas and the Maharanas sit behind the handlooms and weave cloth for the nation. They have the example of Aurangzeb who made his own caps. A greater emperor—Kabir—was himself a weaver and has immortalised the art in his poems. The queens of Europe, before Europe was caught in Satan's trap, spun yarn and considered it a noble calling. The very words, spinster and wife, prove the ancient dignity of the art of spinning and weaving. 'When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then a gentleman,' also reminds one of the same fact. Well may Panditji hope [pg 054] to persuade the royalty of India to return to the ancient calling of this sacred land of ours. Not on the clatter of arms depends the revival of her prosperity and true independence. It depends most largely upon
U|| re-introduction, in every home, of the music of the spinning wheel. It gives sweeter music and is more profitable than the execrable harmonium, concertina and the accordian.
U||Whilst Panditji is endeavouring in his inimitably suave manner to persuade the Indian royalty to take up the spinning wheel, Shrimati Sarala Devi Chaudhrani, who is herself a member of the Indian nobility, has learnt the art and has thrown herself heart and soul into the movement. From all the accounts received from her and others, Swadeshi has become a passion with her. She says she feels uncomfortable in her muslin saris and is content to wear her khaddar saris even in the hot weather. Her khaddar saris continue to preach true Swadeshi more eloquently than her tongue. She has spoken to audiences in Amritsar, Ludhiana and [pg 055] elsewhere and has succeeded in enlisting the services, for her Spinning Committee at Amritsar, of Mrs. Ratanchand and Bugga Chowdhry and the famous Ratan Devi who during the frightful night of the 13th April despite the Curfew Order of General Dyer sat, all alone in the midst of the hundreds of the dead and dying, with her dead husband's cold head in her lap. I venture to tender m
U||y congratulations to these ladies. May they find solace in the music of the spinning wheel and in the thought that they are doing national work. I hope that the other ladies of Amritsar will help Sarala Devi in her efforts and that the men of Amritsar will realise their own duty in the matter.
U||In Bombay the readers are aware that ladies of noted families have already taken up spinning. Their ranks have been joined by Dr. Mrs. Manekbai Bahudarji who has already learnt the art and who is now trying to introduce it in the Sevasadan. Her Highness the Begum Saheba of Janjira and her sister Mrs. Atia Begum Rahiman, have also undertaken to learn the art. I [pg 056] trust that these good ladies will, having learnt spinning, religiously contribute to the nation their daily quota of yarn.
U||I know that there are friends who laugh at this attempt to revive this great art. They remind me that in these days of mills, sewing machines or typewriters, only a lunatic can hope to succeed in reviving the rusticated spinning wheel. These friends forget that the needle has not yet given place to the sewing machine nor has the hand lost its cunning in spite of the typewriter. There is not the slightest reason why the spinning wheel may not co-exist with the spinning mill even as the domestic kitchen co-exists with the hotels. Indeed typewriters and sewing machines may go, but the needle and the reed pen will survive. The mills may suffer destruction. The spinning wheel is a national necessity. I would ask sceptics to go to the many poor homes where the spinning wheel is again supplementing their slender resources and ask the inmates whether the spinning wheel has not brought joy to their homes.
U||[pg 057]Thank God, the reward issued by Mr. Rewashanker Jagjiwanagjiwan bids fair to bear fruit. In a short time India will possess a renovated spinning wheel—a wonderful invention of a patient Deccan artisan. It is made out of simple materials. There is no great complication about it. It will be cheap and capable of being easily mended. It will give more yarn than the ordinary wheel and is capable of being worked by a five years old boy or girl. But whether the new machine proves what it claims to be or it does not, I feel convinced that the revival of hand-spinning and hand-weaving will make the largest contribution to the economic and the moral regeneration of India. The millions must have a simple industry to supplement agriculture. Spinning was the cottage industry years ago and if the millions are to be saved from starvation, they must be enabled to reintroduce spinning in their homes, and every village must repossess its own weaver.
U||Y. I.—21st July 1920.
U||"HANDLOOMS OR POWERMILLS?"[pg 058]
U||Whenever an attempt has been made, as it is being made to-day, to encourage the use and production of hand-spun and hand-woven cloth, many have looked askance whether it is intended in this age of mechanical industrialism to supplant the latter by medieval handlooms. The issue is placed between the hand power and the power mill. A correspondent of the Janmabhumi falls into this common error. Apparently agitated at the idea of reviving the home industries, he exclaims, "The real question for consideration with us or with any people to-day is not whether the handloom will or will not be able to hold its own against the power loom, or whether it cannot feed millions of families or clothe millions more in home-made dress; but which will contribute to the economic and political power of a nation [pg 059] or country, whether it is the handloom or the power-mill? Handicrafts or machine industries—that is the real issue."
U||It is not quite clear from the above what the notions of the correspondent are about the economic and political power of this country. We cannot imagine him to seriously believe—though his argument runs as if he does—that that power can be achieved without feeding and clothing the millions of our half-starving and half-naked men, women and children. The political and economic power of a nation depends even in this "age of mechanical industrialism," not on its powerful machines but on its powerful men. Germany was equipped with the best and most powerful and modern machinery, but it failed because at the last moment the power of its nation failed. We want to organise our national power. This can be done not by adopting the best methods of production only but by the best method of both the production and the distribution. Production that is the manufacture of cloth in this particular instance can be brought about in two ways; [pg 060] (1) by establishing new mills and increasing the output or producing cap
U||acity of each mill and (2) by increasing the number of hand-looms and improving them. All these activities can go together. The notion of a competition between the hand-loom and the power mill has been shown by such an eminent economist as Prof. Radha Kamal Mukerjea to be "altogether wrong." Says Mr. Mukerjea in his Foundations of Indian Economics:
U||"The hand-loom does not compete with the mill, it supplements it in the following way:
U||(1) It produces special kinds of goods which cannot be woven in the mills.
U||(2) It utilizes yarn below and above certain counts which cannot at present be used on the power-mill.
U||(3) It will consume the surplus stock of Indian spinning mills which need not then be sent out of the country.
U||(4) Being mainly a village-industry, it supplies the local demand, at the same time gives employment to small capitalists, weavers and other village workmen and
U||[pg 061](5) lastly it will supply the long-felt want of, and honest field of, work and livelihood for educated Indians."
U||But even this is not all that can be said in favour of hand-loom industry. Mill industry no doubt can be a powerful aid to the promotion of Swadeshi. But apart from the bitter struggle, strife and demoralisation of the capitalist and the workman (as explained by the eminent scholar, administrator and economist, the late Mr. Romesh Chundra Dutt) it has led to, the question is: Can it solve the problem which pure Swadeshi is designed and sought to do and which arises only because of its abandonment? Every writer of note on the industries of India, whatever his ideas and conclusions about the future of Indian Industrialism may be, has shown that there was a time and that was even till the Early British Rule in India—where spinning and weaving, only next to agriculture, were the great national industries of India, when all the cotton was spun by hand and every portion of the work was done by the farming population which augmented its [pg 062] resources by spinning and weaving. Mr. Dutt has given extracts from 
U||the statistical observations of Dr. Francis Buchanan's economic enquiries in Southern and Northern India, conducted between 1798 and 1814. They show how many hundreds of thousands of our men, women and children worked on this industry—mostly in their leisure time—each day and earned crores of rupees annually.
U||How our home-industries came to the sad plight they are in to-day is an open secret, admitted by all authorities and need not be repeated here. Suffice it to say that the problem to-day is not to bring about that political and economic re-organisation of our country, which disturbs the West to-day—an organisation which has led to the breaking up of the society by ceaseless struggles, bitterness and rupture between Capital and Labour. We want to work out the real political and economic regeneration of the country by Swadeshi. And the problem of the Swadeshi is the problem of 80 per cent. of our population who spend more than six months of the year in [pg 063] enforced idleness, eking, throughout the year, a miserable, half-starving and half-naked existence. We must find out suitable work for them during their idle hours. We must make them a real asset and power to the nation. Pure Swadeshi alone can do it.
U||Y. I.—28th July 1920.
U||HAND-SPINNING AND HAND-WEAVING[pg 064]
U||Some people spurn the idea of making in this age of mechanism hand-spinning and hand-weaving a national industry, but they forget there are millions of their countrymen in this age who, for want of suitable occupation, are eking out a most miserable existence, and thousands who die of starvation and underfeeding every year, whereas only a hundred years ago hand-spinning and hand-weaving proved an insurance against a pauper's death. The extent to which relief was provided by this industry is recorded by Mr. Dutt in his "History of India: Victorian age" from the investigations conducted by Dr. Buchanan for seven years, 1813–1820. Dr. Buchanan travelled throughout of the whole country. And his observations and statistics convinced him that next to [pg 065] agriculture, hand-spinning and hand-weaving were the great national industries. We make no apology for giving some of the facts and figures collected by Dr. Buchanan:
U||In the districts of Patna and Behar with a population of 3,364,420 souls, the number of spinners was 330,426. "By far the greater part of these," observed Dr. Buchanan, "spin only a few hours in the afternoon, and upon the average estimate the whole value of the thread that each spins in a year is worth Rs. 7–2–8 giving a total annual income of Rs. 23,67,277 and by a similar calculation the raw material at the retail price will amount to Rs. 12,86,272, leaving a profit of Rs. 10,81,005 for the spinners or Rs. 3–4–0 per spinner...."
U||In the district of Shahbad, spinning was the chief industry. 159,500 women were employed in spinning and spun yarn to the value of Rs. 12,50,000 a year. Deducting the value of cotton each woman had some thing left to her to add to the income of the family to which she belonged.
U||In the Bhagalpur district (with a [pg 066] population of 2,019,900) where all castes were permitted to spin, 160,000 women spent a part of their time in spinning and each made an annual income of Rs. 4½ after deducting the cost of cotton. This was added to the family income. In the Gorakhpur district (population 1,385,495) 175,600 women found employment in spinning and made an annual income of Rs. 2½ per head. In the Dinjapur district (with a population of 300,000) cotton-spinning which was the principal manufacture occupied the leisure hours 'of all women of higher rank and of the greater part of the farmers' wives.' Three rupees was the annual income each woman made by spinning in her afternoon hours.
U||In the Purniya district (population 2,904,380) all castes considered spinning honourable and a very large population of women of the district did some spinning in their leisure hours.
U||In eastern Mysore women of all castes except Brahmans bought cotton and wool at weekly markets, spun at home, and sold the thread to weavers. Men and [pg 067] women thus found a profitable occupation. In Coimbatore, the wives of all the low class cultivators were great spinners.
U||The statistics of weavers show that they also were as numerous as the spinners. In the Patna city and Behar district, the total number of looms employed in the manufacture of chaddars and table cloths was 750, and the value of the annual manufactures was Rs. 5,40,000 leaving a profit of Rs. 81,400, deducting the value of thread. This gave a profit of Rs. 108 for each loom worked by three persons or an income of Rs. 36 a year for each person. But the greater part of the cloth-weavers made coarse cloth for country use to the value of Rs. 24,386,621 after deducting the cost of thread. This gave a profit of Rs. 28 for each loom.
U||In Shahabad weavers worked in cotton only. 7,025 houses of weavers worked in cotton and had 7,950 looms. Each loom made an annual income of Rs. 20¾ a year and each loom required the labour of a man and his wife as well as one boy or girl. But as a family could not be supported for less [pg 068] than Rs. 48 a year, Dr. Buchanan suspected that the income of each loom given above was understated.
U||In the Bhagalpur district some worked in silk alone. A great many near the town made Tasar fabrics of silk and cotton intermixed; 3,275 looms were so employed that the annual profit of each weaver employed in the mixed silk and cotton industry was calculated to be Rs. 46 besides what the woman made.
U||For the weaving of cotton-cloth, there were 7,279 looms. Each loom yielded a profit of Rs. 20 a year. But by another calculation, Dr. Buchanan estimated it to be Rs. 32 a year.
U||In the Gorakhpur district there were 5,434 families of weavers possessing 6,174 looms and each loom brought an income of Rs. 23½. Dr. Buchanan thought this was too low an estimate and believed that each loom brought an income of Rs. 88 in the year.
U||In the Dungarpur district "Maldai" cloth was manufactured. It consisted of silk warp and cotton woof. 4,000 looms [pg 069] were employed in this work and it was said that each loom made Rs. 20 worth of cloth in a month, which Dr. Buchanan considered too high an estimate. About 800 looms were employed in making larger pieces in the form of Elachis.
U||In the Purniya district weavers were numerous.... In Eastern Mysore cotton-weavers made cloth for home-use as silk weavers produced a strong rich fabric. Workmen who made cloth with silk borders earned As. 6 a day and those who made silk cloth earned As. 4.
U||Thus we see that crores of rupees were earned by these spinners and weavers by following their noble and honest calling. The decentralisation of the industry—every village, town and district having always at its command as much supply as it needed—automatically facilitated its distribution and saved the consumer from Railway Excise and all sorts of tariffs and middlemen's profits that he is a victim to to-day. If we cannot return to these days—though there is no reason, except our own bias and doubt why we should not—can we [pg 070] not at least so organise our industries as to do away without much delay with the foreign cloth with which our markets are being dumped to-day?
U||Y. I.—15th Sep. 1920.
U||HAND-SPINNING AGAIN[pg 071]
U||The Servant of India has a fling too at spinning and that is based as I shall presently show on ignorance of the facts. Spinning does protect a woman's virtue, because it enables women, who are to-day working on public roads and are often in danger of having their modesty outraged, to protect themselves, and I know no other occupation that lacs of women can follow save spinning. Let me inform the jesting writer that several women have already returned to the sanctity of their homes and taken to spinning which they say is the one occupation which means so much barkat (blessing). I claim for it the properties of a musical instrument, for whilst a hungry and a naked woman will refuse to dance to the accompaniment of a piano, I have seen women beaming with joy to see the spinning wheel work, for they [pg 072] know that they can through that rustic instrument both feed and clothe themselves.
U||Yes, it does solve the problem of India's chronic poverty and is an insurance against famine. The writer of the jests may not know the scandals that I know about irrigation and relief works. These works are largely a fraud. But if my wise counsellors will devote themselves to introducing the wheel in every home, I promise that the wheel will be an almost complete protection against famine. It is idle to cite Austria. I admit the poverty and limitations of my humanity. I can only think of India's Kamadhenu, and the spinning wheel is that for India. For India had the spinning wheel in every home before the advent of the East India Company. India being a cotton growing country, it must be considered a crime to import a single yard of yarn from outside. The figures quoted by the writer are irrelevant.
U||The fact is that in spite of the manufacture of 62.7 crores pounds of yarn in 1917–18 [pg 073] India imported several crore yards of foreign yarn which were woven by the mills as well as the weavers. The writer does not also seem to know that more cloth is to-day woven by our weavers than by mills, but the bulk of it is foreign yarn and therefore our weavers are supporting foreign spinners. I would not mind it much if we were doing something else instead. When spinning was almost compulsorily stopped nothing replaced it save slavery and idleness. Our mills cannot to-day spin enough for our wants, and if they did, they will not keep down prices unless they were compelled. They are frankly money-makers and will not therefore regulate prices according to the needs of the nations. Hand-spinning is therefore designed to put millions of rupees in the hands of poor villagers. Every agricultural country requires a supplementary industry to enable the peasants to utilise the spare hours. Such industry for India has
U|| always been spinning. Is it such a visionary ideal—an attempt to revive an ancient occupation whose destruction [pg 074] has brought on slavery, pauperism and disappearance of the inimitable artistic talents which was once all expressed in the wonderful fabric of India and which was the envy of the world?
U||And now a few figures. One boy could, if he worked say four hours daily, spin ¼ lb. of yarn. 64,000 students would, therefore, spin 16,000 lbs. per day, and therefore feed 8,000 weavers if a weaver wove two lbs. of hand-spun yarn. But the students and others are required to spin during this year of purification by way of penance in order to popularise spinning and to add to the manufacture of hand-spun yarn so as to overtake full manufacture during the current year. The nation may be too lazy to do it. But if all put their hands to this work, it is incredibly easy, it involves very little sacrifice and saves an annual drain of sixty crores even if it does nothing else. I have discussed the matter with many mill-owners, several economists, men of business and no one has yet been able to challenge the position herein set forth. I do expect the 'Servant [pg 075] of India' to treat a serious subject with seriousness and accuracy of information.
U||Y. I.—16th Feb. 1921.
U||A PLEA FOR SPINNING[pg 076]
U||A determined opposition was put up against the conditions regarding Swadeshi that were laid down in the civil disobedience resolution passed by the All-India Congress Committee at Delhi. It was directed against two requirements, namely, that the civil resister offering resistance in terms of that resolution was bound to know hand-spinning and use only hand-spun and hand-woven khadi; and that in the event of a district or tahsil offering civil disobedience en masse the district or the tahsil concerned must manufacture its own yarn and cloth by the hand. The opposition betrayed woeful ignorance of the importance of hand-spinning. Nothing but hand-spinning can banish pauperism from the land. Paupers cannot become willing sufferers. They have never known the pain of plenty to appreciate the happiness of voluntarily [pg 077] suffering hunger or other bodily discomfort. Swaraj for them can only mean ability to support themselves without begging. To awaken among them a feeling of discontent with their lot without p
U||roviding them with the means of removing the cause thereof is to court certain destruction, anarchy, outrage and plunder in which they themselves will be the chief victims. Hand-spinning alone can possibly supply them with supplementary and additional earnings. Hand-weaving for many and carding for a limited number can provide complete livelihood. But hand-weaving is not a lost art. Several million men know hand-weaving. But very few know hand-spinning in the true sense of the term. Tens of thousands are, it is true, turning the wheel to-day but only a few are spinning yarn. The cry all over is that hand-spun yarn is not good enough for warp. Just as half-baked bread is no bread, even so ill-spun weak thread is no yarn. Thousands of men must know hand-spinning to be able in their respective districts to improve the quality of the yarn that is now being spun [pg 078] in the country. Therefore those who offer civil disobedience for the sake of establishing Swaraj must know hand-spinning. Mark, they are not req
U||uired to turn out yarn every day. It would be well if they did. But they must know how to spin even properly twisted yarn. It was a happy omen to me, that in spite of the opposition the amendment was rejected by a large majority. One argument advanced in favour of rejection was, that the Sikh men considered it an undignified occupation to spin and looked down upon hand-weaving. I do hope that the sentiment is not representative of the brave community. Any community that despises occupations that bring an honest livelihood is a community going down an incline. If spinning has been the speciality of women, it is because they have more leisure and not because it is an inferior occupation. The underlying suggestion that a wielder of the sword will not wield the wheel is to take a distorted view of a soldier's calling. A man who lives by the sword does not serve his community even as the soldiers in the employ of the [pg 079] Government do not serve the country. The wielding of the sword is an unnatural occupatio
U||n resorted to among civilized people only on extraordinary occasions and only for self-defence. To live by hand-spinning and hand-weaving is any day more manly than to live by killing. Aurangzeb was not the less a soldier for sewing caps. What we prize in the Sikhs is not their ability to kill. The late Sardar Lachman Singh will go down to posterity as a hero, because he knew how to die. The Mahant of Nankhana Saheb will go down to posterity as a murderer. I hope therefore that no man will decline to learn the beautiful life-giving art of hand-spinning on the ground of its supposed inferiority.
U||Y. I.—10th Nov. 1921.
U||THE DUTY OF SPINNING[pg 080]
U||In "The Secret of Swaraj" I have endeavoured to show what home spinning means for our country. In any curriculum of the future, spinning must be a compulsory subject. Just as we cannot live without breathing and without eating, so is it impossible for us to attain economic independence and banish pauperism from this ancient land without reviving home-spinning. I hold the spinning wheel to be as much a necessity in every household as the hearth. No other scheme that can be devised will ever solve the problem of the deepening poverty of the people.
U||How then can spinning be introduced in every home? I have already suggested the introduction of spinning and systematic production of yarn in every national school. Once our boys and girls have learnt the art they can easily carry it to their homes.
U||[pg 081]But this requires organisation. A spinning wheel must be worked for twelve hours per day. A practised spinner can spin two tolas and a half per hour. The price that is being paid at present is on an average four annas per forty tolas or one pound of yarn i.e., one pice per hour. Each wheel therefore should give three annas per day. A strong one costs seven rupees. Working, therefore, at the rate of twelve hours per day it can pay for itself in less than 38 days. I have given enough figures to work upon. Any one working at them will find the results to be startling.
U||If every school introduced spinning, it would revolutionize our ideas of financing education. We can work a school for six hours per day and give free education to the pupils. Supposing a boy works at the wheel for four hours daily, he will produce every day 10 tolas of yarn and thus earn for his school one anna per day. Suppose further that he manufactures very little during the first month, and that the school works only twenty six days in the month. He can earn after the first month Rs. 1–10 [pg 082] per month. A class of thirty boys would yield, after the first month, an income of Rs. 48–12 per month.
U||I have said nothing about literary training. It can be given during the two hours out of the six. It is easy to see that every school can be made self supporting without much effort and the nation can engage experienced teachers for its schools.
U||The chief difficulty in working out the scheme is the spinning wheel. We require thousands of wheels if the art becomes popular. Fortunately, every village carpenter can easily construct the machine. It is a serious mistake to order them from the Ashram or any other place. The beauty of spinning is that it is incredibly simple, easily learnt, and can be cheaply introduced in every village.
U||The course suggested by me is intended only for this year of purification and probation. When normal times are reached and Swaraj is established one hour only may be given to spinning and the rest to literary training.

U||THE DUTY OF SPINNING[pg 083]
U||[Speaking at a monster meeting of students held in Mirzapur Park, Calcutta, Mahatma Gandhi appealed to them to withdraw from educational institutions. In the course of that speech he spoke on the duty of spinning, which portion is printed here.]
U||Our education has been the most deficient in two things. Those who framed our education code neglected the training of the body and the soul. You are receiving the education of the soul but the very fact of non-co-operation for non-co-operation is nothing less and nothing more than withdrawing from participation in the evil that this Government is doing and continuing to do. And if we are withdrawing from evil conscientiously, deliberately, it means that we are walking with our face towards God. That completes or begins [pg 084] the soul training. But seeing that our bodily education has been neglected, and seeing that India has become enslaved because India forgot the spinning wheel, and because India sold herself for a mess of pottage, I am not afraid to place before you, the young men of Bengal, the spinning wheel for adoption. And let a training in spinning and production of as much yarn as you can ever do constitute your main purpose and your main training during this year of probation. Let your ordinar
U||y education commence after Swaraj is established, but let every young man, and every girl, of Bengal consider it to be their sacred duty to devote all their time and energy to spinning. I have drawn attention to the parallel, that presents itself before us, from the war.

U||THE DOCTRINE OF CHARKA[pg 085]
U||[The opening session of the National College, Calcutta, under the auspices of the Board of Education, formed by Srijuts Chittaranjan Das, Jitendralal Banerjee and other non-co-operation leaders, took place on Friday the 4th February 1921. In opening this College, Mahatma Gandhi addressed the students and professors, from which the following is culled.]
U||We have sufficiently talked about Charka and how it is going to free India—how a nation that came through the Charka to this country as traders, merchants and travellers settled themselves down as rulers with our co-operation, and how non-co-operation and by means of that very Indian Charka they will go back to their own country if they cannot live as fellow-citizens in India.
U||There are peoples who say—"how can [pg 086] you expect the Mahomedans to be non-violent." How, I do not want to speak out. I want the Charka itself to speak out. The whole Europe will know when we place these Charkas in our mosques. Something like 800 Charkas had been ordered for the mosques so that the people who come there should be able to produce Indian yarn with which Indian clothes should be woven by Indian hands in Indian homes to clothe our nakedness or at least to provide home-spun shrouds for us. Thus every revolution of the Charka I can assure you, will bring the success of this bloodless revolution the nearer every day. That is the doctrine of Charka. Therefore I ask you to work up this doctrine which will be a great advertisement both of our determination to win freedom, and if possible, through peaceful means.
U||If you are determined to have the freedom of your country, if you want to see the cessation of our slavery in which we are living for close upon two centuries, it requires from you a peaceful battle—the battle of the Charka.
U||Y. I.—9th Feb. 1921.
U||THE MESSAGE OF THE CHARKA[pg 087]
U||The Indian Social Reformer has published a note from a correspondent in praise of the spinning-wheel. The correspondent in the course of his remarks hopes, that the movement will be so organised that the spinners may not weary of it. Mr. Amritlal Thakkar in his valuable note (published in the Servant of India) on the experiment which he is conducting in Kathiawad, says that the charkha has been taken up by the peasant women. They are not likely to weary, for to them it is a source of livelihood to which they were used before. It had dried up, because there was no demand for their yarn. Townspeople who have taken to spinning may weary, if they have done so as a craze or a fashion. Those only will be faithful, who consider it their duty to devote their spare hours to doing what is to-day the most useful work for [pg 088] the country. The third class of spinners are the school-going children. I expect the greatest results from the experiment of introducing the charkha in the National Schools. If it is conducted
U|| on scientific lines by teachers who believe in the charkha as the most efficient means of making education available to the seven and a half lacs of villages in India, there is not only no danger of weariness, but every prospect of the nation being able to solve the problem of financing mass education without any extra taxation and without having to fall back upon immoral sources of revenue.
U||The writer in the Indian Social Reformer suggests, that an attempt should be made to produce finer counts on the spinning-wheel. I may assure him that the process has already begun, but it will be some time before we arrive at the finish of the Dacca muslin or even twenty counts. Seeing that hand-spinning was only revived last September, and India began to believe in it somewhat only in December, the progress it has made may be regarded as phenomenal.
U||[pg 089]The writer's complaint that hand-spun yarn is not being woven as fast as it is spun, is partly true. But the remedy is not so much to increase the number of looms, as to persuade the existing weavers to use hand-spun yarn. Weaving is a much more complex process than spinning. It is not, like spinning, only a supplementary industry, but a complete means of livelihood. It therefore never died out. There are enough weavers and enough looms in India to replace the whole of the foreign import of cloth. It should be understood that our looms—thousands of them in Madras, Maharashtra and Bengal—are engaged in weaving the fine yarn imported from Japan and Manchester. We must utilize these for weaving hand-spun yarn. And for that purpose, the nation has to revise its taste for the thin tawdry and useless muslins. I see no art in weaving muslins, that do not cover but only expose the body. Our ideas of art must undergo a change. But even if the universal weaving of thin fabric be considered desirable in nor
U||mal conditions, at [pg 090] the present moment whilst we are making a mighty effort to become free and self-supporting, we must be content to wear the cloth that our hand-spun yarn may yield. We have therefore to ask the fashionable on the one hand to be satisfied with coarser garments; we must educate the spinners on the other hand to spin finer and more even yarn.
U||The writer pleads for a reduction in the prices charged by mill-owners for their manufactures. When lovers of Swadeshi begin to consider it their duty to wear khaddar, when the required number of spinning-wheels are working and the weavers are weaving hand-spun yarn, the mill-owners will be bound to reduce prices. It seems almost hopeless merely to appeal to the patriotism of those whose chief aim is to increase their own profits.
U||Incongruities pointed out by the writer such as the wearing of khaddar on public occasions and at other times of the most fashionable English suits, and the smoking of most expensive cigars by wearers of khaddar, must disappear in [pg 091] course of time, as the new fashion gains strength. It is my claim that as soon as we have completed the boycott of foreign cloth, we shall have evolved so far that we shall necessarily give up the present absurdities and remodel national life in keeping with the ideal of simplicity and domesticity implanted in the bosom of the masses. We will not then be dragged into an imperialism, which is built upon exploitation of the weaker races of the earth, and the acceptance of a giddy materialistic civilization protected by naval and air forces that have made peaceful living almost impossible. On the contrary, we shall then refine that imperialism, into a common wealth of nations which will combine, if they do, for the purpose of giving their best to the world and of protecting, 
U||not by brute force but by self-suffering, the weaker nations or races of the earth. Non-co-operation aims at nothing less than this revolution in the thought-world. Such a transformation can come only after the complete success of the spinning-wheel. India can become fit [pg 092] for delivering such a message, when she has become proof against temptation and therefore attacks from outside, by becoming self-contained regarding two of her chief needs—food and clothing.
U||Y. I.—29th June 1921.
U||THE CHARKA IN THE GITA[pg 093]
U||In the last issue I have endeavoured to answer the objections raised by the Poet against spinning as a sacrament to be performed by all. I have done so in all humility and with the desire to convince the Poet and those who think like him. The reader will be interested in knowing, that my belief is derived largely from the Bhagavadgita. I have quoted the relevant verses in the article itself. I give below Edwin Arnold's rendering of the verses from his Song Celestial for the benefit of those who do not read Sanskrit.
U||Work is more excellent than idleness;
U||The body's life proceeds not, lacking work.
U||There is a task of holiness to do,
U||Unlike world-binding toil, which bindeth not
U||The faithful soul; such earthly duty do
U||[pg 094]Free from desire, and thou shalt well perform
U||Thy heavenly purpose. Spake Prajapati
U||In the beginning, when all men were made,
U||And, with mankind, the sacrifice—"Do this!
U||Work! Sacrifice! Increase and multiply
U||With sacrifice! This shall be Kamadhuk,
U||Your 'Cow of Plenty', giving back her milk
U||Of all abundance. Worship the gods thereby;
U||The gods shall yield ye grace. Those meats ye crave
U||The gods will grant to Labour, when it pays
U||Tithes in the altar-flame. But if one eats
U||Fruits of the earth, rendering to kindly heaven,
U||No gift of toil, that thief steals from his world."
U||Who eat of food after their sacrifice
U||Are quit of fault, but they that spread a feast
U||[pg 095]All for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin.
U||By food the living live; food comes of rain.
U||And rain comes by the pious sacrifice,
U||And sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil;
U||Thus action is of Brahma, who is one,
U||The Only, All—pervading; at all times
U||Present in sacrifice. He that abstains
U||To help the rolling wheels of this great world,
U||Glutting his idle sense, lives a lost life,
U||Shameful and vain.
U||Work here undoubtedly refers to physical labour, and work by way of sacrifice can only be work to be done by all for the common benefit. Such work—such sacrifice can only be spinning. I do not wish to suggest, that the author of the Divine Song had the spinning wheel in mind. He merely laid down a fundamental principle of conduct. And reading in and applying it to India I can only think of spinning as the fittest and most acceptable sacrificial body labour. I cannot imagine anything nobler or more national than that for say one hour [pg 096] in the day we should all do the labour that the poor must do, and thus identify ourselves with them and through them with all mankind. I cannot imagine better worship of God than that in His name I should labour for the poor even as they do. The spinning wheel spells a more equitable distribution of the riches of the earth.
U||Y. I.—20th Oct. 1921.
U||SPINNING AS FAMINE RELIEF[pg 097]
U||Mrs. Jaiji Petit has sent the following notes of an experiment being conducted in spinning among the famine-stricken people at Miri near Ahmednagar. I gladly publish the notes as the experiment is being conducted under the supervision of an Englishwoman. The reader will not fail to observe the methodical manner in which the work is being done. All the difficulties have been met and provided for. Even the very small experiment shows what a potent instrument the spinning wheel is for famine relief. Properly organised it cannot but yield startling results.—M. K. G.
U||In the month of August 1920, when the severity of the famine was being felt, the idea of introducing spinning as a famine relief to respectable middle class people was started and Miss Latham kindly gave [pg 098] a spinning wheel to introduce the work. Attempts were made to introduce the work especially among the Dhangars who were used to spinning wool but they proved futile. Spinning a thin thread of cotton was thought an impossibility in a village which did not know anything about it. Doubts were also entertained as to whether the work if taken up would be paying or at least helpful. In such different difficulties and objections, the wheel remained idle for nearly three months, and in spite of vigorous efforts no body seemed willing to take up the work. In December 1920, Miss Latham again sent four more wheels through the kindness of Mrs. J. Petit and some cotton. They were given for trial to different persons. Signs now seemed a little hopeful and at last one Ramoshi woman was prevailed upon to take up th
U||e work seriously. This was about the 20th of January 1921, since when the work has assumed a different shape. The example of this woman was copied by two more who undertook to take the work. Through great perseverance 4 lbs. of yarn [pg 099] were prepared by these three spinners and it was sent for sale. In the meantime many women began to make the inquiries and expressed a desire to take it up if it helped them financially in some way. A rate of spinning 6 as. a lb. was therefore fixed and it helped other spinners to join the work.
U||Here another difficulty viz. that of funds came in the way. All the five wheels were engaged and five more prepared locally were also engaged. The stock of cotton was also exhausted. It seemed that the work would suffer for want of funds to prepare wheels, purchase cotton, and pay the workers. Rao Bahadur Chitale personally saw this difficulty and helped the work with a grant of Rs. 100. Miss Latham, when she knew of this difficulty, kindly sent another hundred. These two grants came at the right time and gave a stimulus to the work. Local gentlemen helped with their own cotton.
U||The demand for wheels went on increasing day by day. People being too poor to pay for the wheels, it became necessary to [pg 100] get the wheels prepared locally and lend them to the workers. Twenty seven more wheels were prepared which also gave work to local carpenters who had no work on account of famine. One carpenter improved the wheel by making it more light and useful for finer yarn. The prices of the wheel were paid at Rs. 3, Rs. 3–8, and Rs. 4 per wheel according to the quality. Three of these wheels have been sold for Rs. 9–8. The total sum spent on these wheels is Rs. 103–8–0 which includes the sum for the wheels kindly sent by Mrs. Petit.
U||Though local cotton was secured for the work, it proved too bad for beginners. A new method therefore was introduced to improve the local cotton, which not only helped the work but also provided work for a few more persons. Raw cotton was secured and the dirt and the dry leaves in it were carefully removed before it was ginned. The rate for this work was fixed at one pice per lb. Any old man who did this work got an opportunity of earning one anna a day, by cleaning 4 lbs. of raw [pg 101] cotton. After it was thus cleaned, it was ginned with a hand-gin which gave work to some women who ginned, at the rate of one anna per 10 lbs. One woman could thus earn 2 as. and 6 pies each day. This ginned cotton was then cleaned by a pinjari who charged at the rate of one anna per pound and earned about 8 as. per day. It would have been better and easier too, if cotton had been purchased from the mills, but as this cleaning process of the local cotton provided work for a few workers, it was thought the more desirable in 
U||these days. A major portion of these cleaning charges is however made up by the sale of cotton seed secured after ginning. The following statement will show the expenses incurred for this and the price of raw cotton for every 60 lbs.
U||	Rs. a. p.
U||Price of 60 lbs. of raw cotton @ 20 Rs. a patia (240 lbs.).	5—0—0
U||Removal of dirt, waste and dry leaves @ 1 pice per pound	0–15—0
U||Ginning of 52 lbs. of raw clean cotton @ 1 an. per 10 lbs.	0—5—3
U||[pg 102]Cleaning the Lint (17 lbs.) by a pinjari @ 1 Anna per lb.	1—1—0
U||Total	7—4—3
U||Deduct price of cotton seed 35 lbs. @ 20 lbs. per Re.	1–12—0
U||Net charges for 17 lbs. of clean cotton	5—9—3
U||Thus the cost of one pound of cotton comes to 5 as. and 3 pies only. The proportion of waste viz. 8 lbs. in 60 lbs. of raw cotton is too high and could be avoided by securing better and cleaner cotton.
U||There are at present 29 wheels going and there is still a great demand for wheels. But the funds being limited, more wheels could not be prepared and provided. Spinning is done by those who absolutely knew nothing about it previously. Consequently the yarn is still of an inferior sort. It is improving day by day but if a competent teacher could be secured, it would improve rapidly. Amongst the spinners, some are full-time workers and others are leisure-time workers.
U||[pg 103]About two lbs. of yarn are now prepared every day and the quantity will increase as the spinners get used to the work. The rate for spinning is fixed at 6 as. a lb., though many workers complain that it is not enough. As the yarn sent for sale realised a price of As. 12 a pound, the spinning charges could not be increased without a loss. Every lb. of yarn requires Annas 11 pies 3 for expenses, as 0–5–3 for cotton and 0–6–0 for spinning. Thus every lb. leaves a profit of 9 pies only. The establishment and other charges are not calculated. With the present rate of spinning at 6 as. a lb., one spinner earns 3 as. per day by spinning 20 to 24 tolas, more earn 2 as. a day by spinning 15 tolas and the rest 1½ as. a day for 10 tolas, the beginners excluded. The more the spinner is used to the work, the more he will earn.
U||An attempt was made to prepare cloth out of the yarn and three and a half lbs. of yarn were given to a weaver for weaving. He however charged an exorbitant rate for weaving. He prepared nine and a half yards of cloth and charged Rs. 3–9 for it, [pg 104] practically 1 rupee a lb. The cloth cost Rs. 6–0–6 and was sold at Rs. 6–3–0, with a profit of as. 2 and pies 6 only. To obviate the difficulty about weaving, a separate loom with one teacher to teach weaving to local persons is urgently required. Many local people wish to learn this art. A separate loom will reduce the cost of the cloth prepared on it below the prevailing market rate. About 6 lbs. of yarn are given to different weavers to ascertain the exact charges, but all this difficulty can only be removed by having a special loom.
U||When there was a shortage of cotton and the workers had no work, wool was introduced for spinning till cotton was ready. This work was willingly taken up by the Dhangar. They were however required to spin finer thread of wool than they usually prepared. They took some time to pick up the work, and now there are 10 wool spinners working fine thread. They are also paid at 6 as. a lb. for spinning. Wool worth Rs. 31 @ 2 lbs. a rupee was purchased, and though the cotton was ready, the wool spinning was continued [pg 105] by starting a separate department, as the Dhangars readily took up the work. The whole process of cleaning the wool is also done by the Dhangar women, who get an extra anna per lb. for it. The sorting of wool is carefully looked to. The majority of wool spinners use their own spinning wheels but a few are now asking for the improved wheel for preparing finer threads.
U||Dhangar weavers being locally available blankets after the Pandharpur and Dawangiri pattern are being prepared from this finer thread and different designs have been suggested to them. The Dhangars being a stubborn race do not readily adopt the new improvement. But this work has set them to work up new designs of blankets which will permanently help them in their own profession. They now require a broader and improved loom and instruction in colouring wool. Efforts are made to secure a clever full time weaver who will introduce a better method of weaving. Two blankets were prepared and sold at cost price, one for Rs. 5–13–6 and the other for Rs. 6–6–0. Orders are being received for [pg 106] blankets now, but to continue the work would require some funds.
U||To keep so many persons working is not only an ideal form of famine relief, but a means to promote village industries, and remove the demoralising effects of successive famines. Thus stands the work of about one month. It now requires an improved handloom, a good teacher, a special loom for wool, more spinning wheels (which the neighbouring villagers are also demanding) and many other things. The work is going on vigorously and it is hoped will not be allowed to suffer for want of funds.
U||Y. I.—11th May 1921.
U||THE POTENCY OF THE SPINNING-WHEEL[pg 107]
U||No amount of human ingenuity can manage to distribute water over the whole land, as a shower of rain can. No irrigation department, no rules of precedence, no inspection and no water-cess. Every thing is done with an ease and a gentleness that by their very perfection evade notice. The spinning-wheel, too, has got the same power of distributing work and wealth in millions of houses in the simplest way imaginable. Those of us who do not know what it is to earn a livelihood by the sweat of one's brow, may consider the three annas a day as a pittance beneath the consideration of any man. They do not know that even in these days of high prices, there are districts in India where even three annas a day would be a boon to the poor. But we must not consider the [pg 108] question of the spinning-wheel merely from the point of individual earnings. The spinning-wheel is a force in national regeneration. If we wish for real Swaraj, we must achieve economic independence. Boycott of foreign cloth is its negative aspect. 
U||For this we must produce cloth sufficient to clothe the country. This can only be done by hand-spinning. All the mills that we have got, will not be able together to cope with the situation. If all rush for the thin mill-made cloth, it will rise in price beyond the capacity of the poor, and the experience of 1907–08 will be repeated. Moreover, the cloth best suited for the three seasons of India is Khadi. Those who have used Khadi during this summer, have come to realise, that after the soft clean touch of Khadi it is impossible to use sticky Malmal or twills. Khadi can enable its wearer to withstand the cold of an average winter as even wool cannot. The climate of India demands that clothes be washed as often as possible. Only Khadi can stand this constant wash. Khadi was once the dress of the [pg 109] nation at large. One must see to believe how venerable the old Patels and Deshmukhs looked when dressed in home-spun Khadi. There are instances of whole villages taking a legitimate pride in the fact that t
U||hey had to import nothing but salt in the whole round of the six seasons. With such conditions, there could be no drain, no exploitation and therefore no Para-raj. A little village could make terms with the rulers of the land consistent with its self-respect, dignity and independence. Is our love of luxury so inveterate, that we cannot control it even for the sake of Swaraj?
U||Y. I.—6th July 1921.
U||THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE[pg 110]
U||[A certain correspondent from Sindh writing to Mahatma Gandhi puts the question, "Will the spinning wheel solve the problem of India's poverty? If it will, how?" Here is his answer.]
U||I am more than ever convinced that without the spinning wheel the problem of India's poverty cannot be solved. Millions of India's peasants starve for want of supplementary occupation. If they have spinning to add to their slender resources, they can fight successfully against pauperism and famine. Mills cannot solve the problem. Only hand-spinning—and nothing else—can. When India was forced to give up hand-spinning, she had no other occupation in return. Imagine what would happen to a man who found himself suddenly deprived of a quarter of his bare livelihood. Over eighty-five percent of Her population [pg 111] have more than a quarter of their time lying idle. And, therefore, even apart from the terrible drain rightly pointed out by the Grand Old Man of India, she has steadily grown poorer because of this enforced idleness. The problem is how to utilise these billions of hours of the nation without disturbing the rest. Restoration of the spinning wheel is the only possible answer. This has nothing to d
U||o with my special views on machinery or with the boycott of foreign goods in general, India is likely to accept the answer in full during this year. It is madness to tinker with the problem. I am writing this in Puri in front of the murmuring waves. The picture of the crowd of men, women, and children, with their fleshless ribs under the very shadow of Jagannath, haunts me. If I had the power, I would suspend every other activity in schools, and colleges, and everywhere else, and popularise spinning; prepare out of these lads and lasses spinning teachers: inspire every carpenter to prepare spinning wheels; and ask the teachers to take these life-going machines [pg 112] to every home, and teach them spinning. If I had the power, I would stop an ounce of cotton from being exported and would have it turned into yarn in these homes. I would dot India with depots for receiving this yarn and distributing it among weavers. Given sufficient steady and trained workers, I would undertake to drive pauperism out of Indi
U||a during this year. This undoubtedly requires a change in the angle of vision and in the national taste. I regard the Reforms and everything else in the nature of opiates to deaden our conscience. We must refuse to wait for generations to furnish us with a patient solution of a problem which is ever-growing in seriousness. Nature knows no mercy in dealing stern justice. If we do not wake up before long, we shall be wiped out of existence. I invite the sceptics to visit Orissa, penetrate its villages, and find out for themselves where India stands. They will then believe with me that to possess, or to wear, an ounce of foreign cloth is a crime against India and humanity. I am able to restrain myself from committing [pg 113] suicide by starvation, only because I have faith in India's awakening, and her ability to put herself on the way to freedom from this desolating pauperism. Without faith in such a possibility, I should cease to take interest in living. I invite the questioner, and every other intelligent l
U||over of his country, to take part in this privileged national service in making spinning universal by introducing it in every home, and make it profitable for the nation by helping to bring about a complete boycott of foreign cloth during this year. I have finished the questions and endeavoured to answer them. The most important from the practical stand-point was the one regarding spinning. I hope, I have demonstrated the necessity of home-spinning as the only means of dealing with India's poverty. I know, however, that innumerable difficulties face a worker in putting the doctrine into execution. The most difficult, perhaps, is that of getting a proper wheel. Save in the Punjab where the art is still alive, the difficulty is very real. The carpenters have forgotten the [pg 114] construction and the innocent workers are at their wit's end. The chief thing undoubtedly, therefore, is for the worker to make himself acquainted with the art and the handling of spinning wheels. I lay down some simple tests for tes
U||ting them. No machine that fails to satisfy the tests should be accepted or distributed.
U||    (1) The wheel must turn easily, freely, and noiselessly.
U||    (2) The turning handle must be rigidly fixed to the axle.
U||    (3) The post must be properly driven home and joints well-fixed.
U||    (4) The spindle must turn noiselessly and without a throb in its holders. Jarring sound cannot be avoided unless the holders are made of knit straw as in the Punjab, or of tough leather.
U||    (5) No machine is properly made unless it manufactures in the hands of a practised spinner at least 2½ tolas of even and properly twisted yarn of six counts in an hour. I know a youngster, who has not had more than perhaps [pg 115] three months' practice, having been able to spin 2½ tolas of the above quality of yarn in 35 minutes. No machine should be given until it has been worked at least full one hour in the manner suggested and found satisfactory.
U||Y. I.—6th April 1921.
U||THE SPINNING WHEEL[pg 116]
U||[On February 15, 1922, Mahatma Gandhi has addressed the following letter to Sir Daniel Hamilton from Bardoli on the Spinning Wheel.]
U||Dear Sir,
U||Mr. Hodge writes to me to say that you would like to have an hour's chat with me, and he has suggested that I should open the ground which I gladly do. I will not take up your time by trying to interest you in any other activity of mine except the spinning wheel. Of all my outward activities, I do believe that the spinning wheel is of the most permanent and the most beneficial. I have abundant proof now to support my statement that the spinning wheel will solve the problem of economic distress in millions of India's homes, and it constitutes an effective insurance, against famines.
U||[pg 117]You know the great Scientist Dr. P. C. Ray, but you may not know that he has also become an enthusiast on behalf of the spinning wheel. India does not need to be industrialized in the modern sense of the term. It has 7,50,000 villages scattered over a vast area 1,900 miles long, 1,500 miles broad. The people are rooted to the soil, and the vast majority are living a hand-to-mouth life. Whatever may be said to the contrary, having travelled throughout the length and breadth of the land with eyes open, and having mixed with millions, there can be no doubt that pauperism is growing. There is no doubt also that the millions are living in enforced idleness for at least 4 months in the year. Agriculture does not need revolutionary changes. The Indian peasant requires a supplementary industry. The most natural is the introduction of the spinning wheel, not the hand-loom. The latter cannot be introduced in every home, whereas the former can, and it used to be so even a century ago. It was driven out not by e
U||conomic pressure but by force deliberately [pg 118] used as can be proved from authentic records. The restoration, therefore, of the spinning wheel solves the economic problem of India at a stroke. I know that you are a lover of India, that you are deeply interested in the economic and moral uplift of my country. I know too that you have great influence. I would like to enlist it on behalf of the spinning wheel. It is the most effective force for introducing successful Co-Operative Societies. Without honest co-operation of the millions, the enterprise can never be successful, and as it is already proving a means of weaning thousands of women from a life of shame, it is as moral an instrument as it is economic.
U||I hope you will not allow yourself to be prejudiced by anything you might have heard about my strange views about machinery. I have nothing to say against the development of any other industry in India by means of machinery but I do say that to supply India with cloth manufactured either outside or inside through gigantic mills is an economic blunder of [pg 119] the first magnitude just as it would be to supply cheap bread through huge bakeries established in the chief centres in India and to destroy the family stove.

U||A MODEL WEAVING-SCHOOL
U||All the external activities of Satyagrahashram in connection with Swadeshi have for some time now been taken over by the Gujarat Provincial Congress Committee. People, who are in need of or wish to know anything about ginning-wheels, spinning-wheels, looms and Khadi, are requested to correspond with the Secretary of the Khadi department of that Committee. The Ashram now only conducts a weaving-school, which teaches all the processes from ginning right up to weaving. The boys of the Ashram school are at present taking the full course of instruction here, and we have not the room [pg 124] to take up students from outside. Some description of the work done is given here in the hope, that it may perhaps furnish suggestions to outside students and to schools desirous of having spinning-classes attached to them.
U||Forty-nine spinning wheels are here regularly at work, over and above twenty-five others which are reserved for beginners. All these are worked three to six hours per day. Some are worked for even seven or eight hours. After a month's training, a friend worked twelve to fourteen hours daily for a number of days and thus proved the possibility of earning three annas a day. Another, a sister, spun nine to ten hours daily for some days after finishing her round of domestic business. In a month and a half, she had spun enough to get sadlas and other cloth woven out of yarn spun by herself, and actually began wearing these things. She is now-a-days spinning at the rate of eight hours a day. One day there was something wrong with this lady's rentia. She referred the matter to the present writer who set it right. But [pg 125] she was not satisfied. She complained again, and again was the rentia operated upon. But the wheel apparently suffered from some occult malady, which she was at a loss to diagnose. Every time 
U||its spinning power would get enfeebled. At last the poor lady lost all patience and was almost ready to weep. This was reported to me, and this time I examined the wheel very critically and effected a perfect cure. It now moved merrily, and merrily did the sister proceed with her work. It is very desirable that all the wheels in a spinning-class be kept in a perfect condition. When that is the case, the spinner does not tire and works cheerfully and speedily. Our class is attended by five ladies, who spin five or six hours every day, and by twenty-three students of the Ashram school, of whom eighteen are boys and five are girls. The conduct of this class is not an easy job. Their spirits are in continual need of cheering. Some of them spin very rapidly. But sometimes there is a grievous attack of head-ache, at other times the still more grievous attack of idleness. [pg 126] Sometimes the hand is fatigued, at other times the wheel gets out of repair.
U||We are now replacing the thick by a thin spindle. It is true that with the slightest interference or rough handling, this thin spindle bends and begins to wobble. But it makes the movement of the wheel very smooth and easy, and also adds to its speed, as the revolutions are doubled from the fifty of the thick spindle to a hundred in the thin spindle following from one revolution of the large wheel. The doubling of revolutions does not mean a double output, but there is certainly a considerable increase. With the thick spindle, the wheel must go through 8 or 10 revolutions for the drawing and winding of one length of yarn; with the thin spindle, the revolutions of the wheel needed for that purpose are reduced to 4 or 5. Hence with the thin spindle, there is an economy of labour. The speed of drawing the yarn by the hand is clearly limited, so that 200 or 300 revolutions of the spindle instead of 100 would not double or treble the speed or the output. Advanced students draw and wind [pg 127] two feet to two fe
U||et and a half of yarn every five seconds. This comes to 8 to 10 yards a minute. If the sliver is good and the student in a spinning-mood, there is less breakage of yarn. Even considering the time lost on account of breakage and joining, some students are easily able to spin 400 to 500 yards of yarn of about 12 counts, fit for warp. This approximates to the speed of a mill spindle, and is therefore quite satisfactory. When the work is over, the student removes the spindle from the wheel and keeps it in good preservation. Yet accidents do occur. The class master must know how to repair a spindle which has thus gone wrong. He must also know how to put the wheel in good working order. The string which makes the spindle revolve often breaks, but if it is well-twisted, treated with wax, and then rubbed well with a piece of cloth, it becomes more durable and lasts for a number of days.
U||The students generally like to work on the rentia. But the moment it gets a little wrong and cannot be soon corrected, they rise and flee. Not only the beginners [pg 128] but even advanced scholars are sometimes confused, when called upon to set right such a simple machine as the spinning-wheel. A veteran leader who set the non-co-operating students of engineering at work upon the spinning-wheel, made the remark that English education has incapacitated our young men. It was with great pain that he said this. And it is the simple truth of the matter. We can clearly see, that as a result of this education, we have not only lost the power of our hands and feet, but we also lack in patience and perseverance. We cannot bear to take the trouble of correcting anything that is wrong. Newspaper leader-writers question the educative value of spinning and doubt its efficacy in driving away poverty from our midst. Their doubts would vanish if ever they tried and saw for themselves what children gain from the spinning-wh
U||eel. But these writers are themselves the product of English education. To expect them to be patient, is to forget the character of the discipline to which they have been subject. There is no better test [pg 129] than the spinning-wheel, if we wish to ascertain whether our children are educated in the real and the proper sense of that term.
U||Many people still question the economic value of hand spinning. But I believe that the results of our experiments may perhaps lead them to reconsider their views. I will here put down the statistics of our own class. Among our students there are five playful children, who spin only when the spirit possesses them. But all of them spin good yarn fit for warp. Hardly any spin yarn below 10 counts. Many spin yarn of about 15 counts. Now-a-days the boys are giving four hours to spinning. Formerly they used to work six hours daily, but then there was a tendency to occasional slackness. Now we have ruled that when once a student has spun a length of 1000 yards, he may be allowed to leave the spinning class, and learn carding etc. This arrangement has had excellent efforts. All spin without losing a moment and spin 1000 yards in two to four hours according to the skill acquired. And the [pg 130] yarn thus produced is pretty uniform, well twisted, and fit for warp. We have fixed a round wire frame on the axle of the 
U||wheel just near the handle, with a circumference of 4 feet. This frame is used for opening the cone into a hank. 750 revolutions of this mean a thousand yards of yarn. Most students count the revolutions, while they are moving the frame, and hence do not take much additional time for calculations. Some are not able to practice this, and they count the length after they have prepared the hank.
U||1000 yards of yarn of six counts weigh 8 tolas. (840 yards make a hank. If six such hanks weigh a pound, the yarn is of 6 counts. Hence 840 yards of six count of yarn weigh 6⅔ tolas.) 4 annas is a quite proper wage for spinning one pound of six-count yarn of a standard quality. This means a wage of nine pies and a half for spinning 8 tolas. But most of our students spin yarn of 12 to 15 counts, and even finer. And this is quite good and fit for weaving. The wage for a thousand yards of finer yarn must be proportionately higher; as the [pg 131] finer the yarn, the greater the number of twists to be given to it. Twelve-count yarn requires nearly half as much twisting again as six-count yarn. Hence the wage of a thousand yards of twelve-count yarn must be half as much again as that of the same length of six-count yarn. But this proportionately higher wage makes the hand-spun yarn much dearer than the mill-made yarn of the same count. If we take 8 and 12 annas to be the wage for spinning a pound of yarn of 12 
U||and 16 counts respectively, the wage for spinning a length of 1000 yards of the same counts will be 10 or 11 pies. One student spins this amount in 2 hours, several in 3 hours and the rest in 4.
U||On the last Amavasya it was twenty two days since the students set regularly to work after the vaishaka vacation. Deducting three holidays on Sundays and three half-holidays on Wednesdays, we get seventeen and a half working days. There was an average attendance of twenty two students out of twenty three. Twenty two students spun in seventeen days and [pg 132] a half twenty four shers and a half of yarn of about fourteen counts. If we take ten annas to be the average wage for spinning a sher, this comes to fifteen rupees and four annas. This is exclusive of Rs. 1–11–0 which is the wage of 18 pounds of cotton carded and made into slivers by one student in 12 days, calculated at an anna and a half per pound. It is also exclusive of the extra work put in by students on five or six days after finishing their daily quota of 1000 yds. of yarn by way of carding and opening yarn for weaving tapes and carpets. These students gave some of their private time also to this work.
U||There is no doubt, that the figures will mount higher when the students acquire the habit of methodical work. But whatever the pecuniary value of their work might be, method in work itself will be an acquisition beyond all price.
U||So much for the spinning department. I hope to be able to deal with the weaving department on another occasion.
U||Y. I.—21st July 1921.
U||SPINNING DEPARTMENT[pg 133]
U||I should like to add a few more facts about the spinning department, before I come to weaving.
U||In Ashadha the students were more energetic than before. The number of regular students was 21, and these in 23 working days (there being six holidays in the month) spun 30 pounds and 24 tolas of yarn of about 12 counts on the average, fit for warp. At ten annas a pound, this means a wage of Rs. 19–2–0. The total number of hours of spinning was 1337. At 4 hours a day it should have been 1932 (23 number of days × 21 number of students × 4). This deficiency is not due to idleness, nor to headache. Complaints of idleness have now quite ceased. And students now understand that headache may prevent one from reading or working sums but not from spinning. They have also realised that if [pg 134] the arms are fatigued by fetching water or swimming, there is nothing like spinning for removing the fatigue. The thing is that those students who have mastered spinning were engaged in carding and other process. If full time had been given to spinning, we would have turned out a proportionately bigger quantity of yar
U||n.
U||The spinning power of the students is increasing every day. The student who spun 7 tolas an hour during the Satyagraha week is now no longer a prodigy and others are fast overtaking him. One day a girl spun 9 tolas of uniform and well-twisted 12-count yarn in 6 hours. At the above rate this means a wage of 2 annas 3 pies. For 8 hours therefore the wage would be 3 annas, for 12 hours 4 annas 6 pies, for 14 hours 5 annas 3 pies. But it is hardly necessary to emphasise the pecuniary value of the work, so far as schools are concerned. The point is that by constituting spinning as a permanent part of our school curricula we provide manual training of the highest kind and at the same time prepare for the re-advent of a day when spinning will be [pg 135] as much a part of our domestic economy as say cooking.
U||Y. I.—11th Aug. '21.
U||THE ADVANTAGE OF THE THIN SPINDLE[pg 136]
U||Since we introduced the thin Spindle, we have been keeping a number of them in reserve. When a student has his spindle bent, it is not corrected there and then but he is at once given one of the spare good ones, so there is no delay. Afterwards all the spindles that have gone wrong are collected and corrected together.
U||The sadi, i.e. the wrapping on the spindle which serves as a pulley, is often cut by itself and has sometimes to be cut off in order to correct the spindle. A new sadi has to be wrapped and for this a bottle of thick gum is kept ready at hand. It must be made of fine strong yarn, and be wrapped very tight. If it is loose, the string which revolves the spindle (mala) sinks in it and cuts it asunder, and at once the spindle stops. If the sadi is made of coarse yarn, [pg 137] it becomes rough, and so the mala does not run smoothly, and the spindle throbs and causes breakage of the yarn while it is being spun.
U||Pairs of chamarakhan (leather-bearing) also are kept in reserve. When these become too soft by an excess of oiling or by rough handling, they must be changed. Now-a-days we make them from raw hides and not from leather or bamboo, and so they keep longer.
U||Formerly a round piece of wood or cardboard used to serve as a rest for winding the cone. But now we have substituted a piece of horn which is more durable. Wax is kept in stock for treating the mala. Besides these things we have a small oil-can, a pen-knife, a hammer, a chisel, and a small anvil.
U||The students bring the hank twisted hard in the shape of a stick. The hank weighs two tolas, which is the standard weight of the sliver provided. A bigger hank causes trouble while we open it, and the yarn is spoilt. The yarn spun by each student is kept separate with his name upon a wooden [pg 138] tag attached to it. Every student is asked to stick to one particular count all along till he has spun out enough for a length of warp; and then the yarn is sent to the weaving department. Every one is anxious to see when his yarn is sent out for weaving. Three such lengths of warp are being woven at present. About seven are ready waiting to be woven. An eleven year old girl will soon get a piece 20 yards long and 42 inches wide out of yarn spun by herself in the course of three months. This will provide her with two suits of clothing of two small sadis, 2 blouses and 2 petticoats. Her father had put in a pound of yarn spun by himself, to finish up the piece, and in return for this, she is going to spare a dhoti 
U||for him too. She is as much pleased to see the cloth woven from her own yarn as most girls would be to see brocade. Two other girls have combined their stock of yarn and are daily asking for it to be woven. Those students who have passed out from the spinning class are engaged in other departments, and have not much time to spare for spinning; so they work on holidays and [pg 139] prepare woof for their own warps, which are waiting to be woven. So in the second month, the spinning department is in full swing.
U||Y. I.—18th Aug. 1921.
U||HAND-LOOMS[pg 140]
U||The working of the spinning class having been fully described in the first two articles, the process next to be taken up is carding; but having received a number of queries as to the working of hand-looms, I propose to deal with this before going into intermediate processes.
U||Questions are asked as to which will be the most useful loom for weaving hand-spun yarn. Some want our opinion about the automatic looms; others insist upon the necessity of inventing a new swift-working machine, while still others ask for monetary help to prepare such after their own designs.
U||My humble but firm opinion is that the old pit-loom is the best, especially for weaving hand-spun yarn. No doubt it is the slowest working instrument but is the surest of all, and just as our old spinning-wheel [pg 141] in spite of its being the slowest instrument is absolutely capable of spinning out all the cotton that India produces to-day, so the old pit-loom is perfectly capable of weaving out all the yarn that India can produce by means of the spinning wheels and the mills.
U||This is not the time to enter into the figures in support of my statement. I shall only try to show the usefulness of the pit-loom. The fly-shuttle loom has its place in the sphere of home industry as well as of the factory, but the automatic looms have no room in this industry. Its drawbacks can only be realized by a study of the facts and figures regarding concerns which employ such looms. People who newly take up this industry should beware of flashy advertisements. They should not be misled by professed calculations of the working of such looms.
U||The fly-shuttle looms have varying adjustments. In the Muzzaffarpur spinning and weaving exhibition held in May last, a party from this school was present with its wheel and loom. Of all the fly-shuttle [pg 142] looms exhibited, the one from this school was selected as the simplest and lightest of all. It is all made of wood, with the exception of nails and screws required for joining. The pickers are also made entirely of wood. The shuttle and perns are home-made. Other looms had iron bars in their boxes, were operated with foreign shuttles, and their perns were unwieldy. Our loom is modelled upon a type of looms working in thousands in the Madras Presidency. The whole loom with a wooden frame to fit on a pit, with the exception of the shields and reed costs Rs. 45. These latter things are not supplied, as there is no fixed standard of the yarn to be used on it.
U||I wish some public spirited person or firm will come forward in Madras or elsewhere in that presidency and undertake to supply the fly-shuttle loom as described above promptly and at reasonable rates. Any one desirous of taking up this work may correspond with the head of the Khadi Department, Gujarat Provincial Congress Committee Ahmedabad.
U||[pg 143]Thus far as regards the fly-shuttle looms. I suggest to new manufacturers that they cannot do better than start with the old fashioned pit-looms. It is our experience that on account of less breakage of yarn, especially hand-spun yarn, the output of a pit-loom almost equals and in some cases even exceeds that of the fly-shuttle loom. In weaving broader width, however, the fly-shuttle is certainly more convenient. And when the hand-spun yarn is of good test, it enjoys a decided advantage over the old loom in point of swiftness. But we have to remember that we have got to deal with hand-spun yarn which is not likely to have a good test for some time to come. It is therefore that the old loom is the safest and surest weaving instrument to go on with for the present.
U||Y. I.—25th Aug. 1921.
U||WHAT KIND OF LOOM?[pg 144]
U||Questions are asked as to the production of cloths in an old-fashioned loom from handspun yarn. The experience in our school is, that a well-practised worker weaves on a pit-loom one yard cloth of 30 inches width and of fairly thick texture in one hour. Cloth of greater or smaller width varies in proportion. Our fly-shuttle pit-loom has not exceeded this figure in handspun yarn so far. When formerly we used mill-made yarn, it yielded about half as much cloth again as the old pit-loom. However in weaving dhotiyans and sadis from handspun as well as mill-made yarn the flyshuttle is very handy.
U||Then there is a question as to the necessity of beaming the yarn. We believe, that where there is no question of room, beaming should be dispensed with. Hand-loom weaving factories situated in thickly [pg 145] populated towns where rates of house-rent are very high, have reason to resort to beaming; but where space allows stretching of the yarn as practised by the professional weavers, it is a time-saving method and is artistic as well. There is an argument in favour of beaming that it allows of the handling of warp as long as 200 or even 300 yards. But if such length of handspun yarn can be prepared, it is equally easy, if not easier, to stretch it in the old style.
U||SIZING HANDSPUN YARN[pg 146]
U||It is said, that the difficulty of sizing handspun yarn is a serious handicap from which the movement suffers. As a matter of fact, the method of sizing it should be no different from that of sizing mill-made yarn. It is slipshod spinning which is at the bottom of this difficulty. The best way out of it is to organise and improve the production of handspun yarn. It is superstition to say that the yarn spun on the charkha cannot be strong and even. Where proper care is taken, it does improve and even surpass mill-made yarn in some respects. Punjab and Marwad, where spinning has been carried on from past times, have also to improve their yarn. Not that the spinners there do not know their work, but they as well as the merchants who purchase their yarn are careless about the quality of the yarn turned out. Unless this work is taken up by men imbued with the true Swadeshi spirit, the condition is not likely to improve. The spinners should be visited at their work [pg 147] from time to time, and proper instructio
U||ns as to the required twist and test to be given to the yarn should be imparted to them. The payment of a reasonably higher wage than the present is another way of improving the yarn. The wages we have arranged for our guidance are given below in the form of a table. Where living is cheaper than in Gujarat, they can be adjusted accordingly. The yarn having improved, the difficulty of sizing will disappear.
U||When a country weaver shows inability to weave hand-spun yarn, it means that he cannot weave it in the same reed space as he uses for the mill-made yarn. This is quite evident. The hand-spun yarn not being even, it requires wider reed space. The table given below also shows the number of ends of different counts to be drawn in an inch of a reed. Then if the cloth to be woven is meant for shirting or coating and not for dhotiyan or sadi, and if the yarn has a good test, two to four ends can be added to the number denoted in the table.
U||[pg 148]Count.	Test.	Wage per pound.	Approximate twist per inch.	Rounds on 4 feet hank frame.	Number of ends in an inch of reed.	Number of double ends in an inch.	Rates of weaving per square yard.

U||20	Weft	0 13 0	15	"	...	...	...
U||[pg 149]If the yarn is very weak and uneven, it should be woven with two ends in warp as well as in weft. This will give a strong texture to the cloth, making the process of weaving easy at the same time. The proportion in this case of ends to be drawn in an inch of the reed space is also given in the above table. If this course is adopted, heaps of handspun yarn that have accumulated all over the country can be woven out without much difficulty.
U||As a fact, the method of sizing traditionally followed by the weavers cannot be improved upon. Their selection of the sizing material is appropriate to the climate, season and circumstances. For the most part they use the staple corn. Jawari and maize being the cheapest are used in many parts. In the rainy season, however, they use wheat flour as a stronger sizing material to counteract the over-softening influence of the moisture present in the air. In the Madras Presidency, a cereal called ragi with a yellowish flour is used for coarse counts, while rice is used for finer counts. Rice and wheat are the [pg 150] best ingredients for sizing. The proportion used is from 10 per cent required for fine yarn to 20 per cent for coarse yarn.
U||Different preparations of various sizing materials are as follow:—
U||Wheat: Weigh the warp first. Then according to its fineness or coarseness, take fine wheat flour or Menda from 10 to 20 per cent of its weight, knead it well with water to form a thin paste, taking care that no lump remains. Boil some water just enough to soak the warp, then add the paste previously prepared and keep on stirring till the granules are well-cooked and the whole substance is reduced to the form of thin gruel. To every such preparation of one pound of flour, one ounce of sesamum or sweet oil should be added. This will give softness and smoothness to the threads of the warp and keep them from sticking to one another. Cocoanut or castor oil is also used as a lubricant. Any of these is good, except only that the castor oil will give a bad odour and a dull colour to the warp. The size thus prepared is then slowly poured on to the warp, which [pg 151] is kept folded on a gunny cloth or a clean slab. The warp is beaten with both the hands, while the process of pouring is going on, and when it is thoro
U||ughly saturated all over, it is spread out in the open and brushed repeatedly in one direction, often bringing the down side up till it gets dried. One or two or more persons according to the length of the warp are engaged in brushing, while several others are joining broken threads and shifting the sticks in the warp from one lease to another.
U||This is the most thorough of all the methods of sizing. The ends of fibres lying loose on every thread of the warp are straightened, and stuck fast round the thread by the process of brushing. The thread is rendered smooth and strong like wire, and the work of weaving is made all the easier by it. Thus swiftness in weaving is ensured. To master this requires long practice but it is worth the while of every student to do so. For an energetic youth about three hours' work under an expert every morning for two months or so is sufficient. With two assistants or more he [pg 152] will then be able to manage the brush-sizing himself without the aid of an expert. A less active person will take four or six months' practice.
U||The preparation of size from jawari and maize flour is just the same as from wheat flour, except that the flour of these cereals not being so fine as wheat flour, a larger quantity is required in their case.
U||Some people advise that wheat flour should be soaked for at least two days before it is boiled with water. It is said that the adherent quality of the flour is enhanced by this process.
U||Rice. The preparation from rice is simpler still. The required quantity of rice is boiled well with a quantity of water larger than that used for ordinary cooking and is allowed to remain for 12 to 24 hours. It is then strained through a piece of cloth tied over or into the mouth of a large vessel, more water being added as required in the process of straining. The strained matter is then reduced to consistent thinness; then oil is added to it in proportion as described above.
U||[pg 153]Rice is sometimes preferred to wheat, as it gives besides strength a fine gloss to the warp.
U||The thing to be borne in mind is that the yarn meant for preparing warp must be made thoroughly absorbent beforehand. For this, all the hanks must be connected in the form of one chain. It is then folded together, placed into a big vessel, whether of earth or metal, containing water enough to soak the yarn and then well pressed with both the feet for some time. It is left in this condition for two or three days, during which period it is beaten with a wooden club on a slab twice every day. It should be remembered that, unless it is beaten, it does not soak through for days. If it is not soaked well, it is incapable of absorbing the sizing material, and is imperfectly sized. The cotton fibre has a natural oily coating on it, which is removed by soaking it as described before or by boiling it for some time. It does not become thoroughly absorbent, till it is treated in this manner. After two or three days, when the yarn is well soaked, the chain is [pg 154] opened out and dried in shade, every hank being hung 
U||separately on a bamboo. Before it gets completely dried, it is well shaken with both the hands twice or thrice, so that the threads do not stick to one another. The Madrasi weavers are used to pouring rice water (generally thrown away when the rice is boiled) on the yarn, before it is dried out in the manner described above. This gives greater strength to the yarn, and causes less breakage in the process of winding and preparing it into warp.
U||The other method of sizing resorted to by the weavers is called hank-sizing. It is an easy process, and though not so efficient as brush-sizing, it answers well if carefully performed. In this case the yarn, before it is made up into a warp, is soaked, hank by hank, into the size prepared from wheat or rice as described above, and after pressing off the size a little from the hank with the thumb and a finger, the hank, wet as it is, is wound up on a bobbin. The warp is prepared immediately while the bobbin is wet, each thread drying on the [pg 155] warping sticks as soon as another is drawn out. The warp thus prepared is fit for weaving.
U||We have tried hank-sizing in a weak solution of ordinary gum. It works well in dry season, but makes the yarn moist in wet season on account of its absorbent quality.
U||[pg 156]II
U||THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE
U||Mr. Gandhi during his visit to Assam and Eastern Bengal has observed, that the type of charkha in use in those parts is deficient in many ways. The same is perhaps the case in other provinces. As we believe that the charkha in the Satyagrahashram is a model of its kind, we give below a diagram with measurements of all its parts with an explanation of their relative functions.
U||[pg 157]The rear base with mark 1 is one foot 9 inches long, 4 inches wide and 3 inches high.
U||The front base with mark 2 is 9 inches long, 4 inches wide and 3 inches high.
U||The long piece which joins the two bases, marked 3, is 3 feet long (including joints), 3 inches wide and 2 inches high.
U||The large uprights marked 4 are 1 foot 6 inches long including joints, 2 inches wide, and 3 inches deep. They are fixed on the back base 9 inches apart. The holes in which the axle rests are made 2 inches below the top. These holes contain bearings of thin iron plates to secure easy motion of the axle. The bearings are kept open at the top to allow access of oil through a slanting hole bored on the outward sides of both the uprights, one inch above the axle.
U||The small uprights marked 5 are 9 inches long with joints 1½ inches wide and 1½ inches deep, with holes 4 inches below the top to contain the leather bearings which bear the spindle. They are fixed 3 inches apart on the front base and are connected together 2 inches above [pg 158] the base with a piece of a wood of the same thickness. This joining piece contains in the middle 2 sticks half an inch apart to regulate the position of the mala (the string which revolves the spindle) on the spindle.
U||Another piece marked 6 and joined parallelly to the left upright is meant to bear a hole for leather bearing when a thin spindle is to be used.
U||The drum or wheel consists of 8 planks such as the one marked 7, each being 2 feet long, 4 inches wide and ¾ inch thick. They are divided in two wings of 4 planks each, each containing two couples of planks joined diametrically with a groove in the middle.
U||Both the wings are nailed on to the wooden shaft marked 8, its size being 4½ inches long and 4 inches diameter.
U||Through the middle of this shaft passes a long round iron bar, which serves as an axle. It is 19 inches long and half an inch thick. Its end, where the handle is fixed is made square to ensure firmness of the handle.
U||[pg 159]A wooden washer one inch thick is fixed to the axle on either side of the drum to avoid its contact with the uprights.
U||The handle is shaped put of a wooden piece of 2 inches × 2 inches × 1½ feet long.
U||The reel noticed in the diagram between the drum and the handle is composed of a wooden disc marked 9 made out of 1 inch thick and 6 inches square piece of wood. Six brackets made of galvanized wire of 10 gauge radiate from the centre of the disc so as to make a circumference of 4 feet. The brackets are fixed in the back of the disc with bent ends and are further secured with small nails near the circumference of the disc.
U||A wire noose is fixed on the back base just below the reel to regulate the yarn when wound up on the reel from a bobbin or directly from the spindle.
U||A 4 inches long bamboo pin is fixed in the inward side of the front base parallelly to the long plank marked 3. It is meant to hold the bobbin while opening out yarn from it. When the yarn is opened from [pg 160] the spindle directly, it is held in the left hand with the point towards the reel. The right hand is employed in turning the reel by the handle of the charkha.
U||The figure 10, indicates the position of the spinner.

U||PRÉFACE
U||CETTE onzième édition a été remaniée, à l'occasion du centenaire de la naissance de Tolstoy. On y a mis à profit la correspondance tolstoyenne, publiée depuis 1910. L'auteur a ajouté tout un chapitre consacré aux relations de Tolstoy avec les penseurs des différents pays d'Asie: Chine, Japon, Inde, nations islamiques. Particulièrement importants sont les rapports avec Gandhi. Nous reproduisons in extenso une lettre, écrite par Tolstoy, un mois avant sa mort, où l'apôtre russe trace tout le plan de campagne de la Non-Résistance, dont le Mahâtmâ des Indes devait faire, par la suite, un si puissant emploi.

U||VIE DE TOLSTOÏ
U||La grande âme de Russie, dont la flamme s'allumait, il y a cent ans, sur la terre, a été, pour ceux de ma génération, la lumière la plus pure qui ait éclairé leur jeunesse. Dans le crépuscule aux lourdes ombres du XIXe siècle finissant, elle fut l'étoile consolatrice, dont le regard attirait, apaisait nos âmes d'adolescents. Parmi tous ceux—ils sont nombreux en France—pour qui Tolstoï fut bien plus qu'un artiste aimé, un ami, le meilleur, et, pour beaucoup, le seul ami véritable dans tout l'art européen,—j'ai voulu apporter à cette mémoire sacrée mon tribut de reconnaissance et d'amour.
U||Les jours où j'appris à le connaître ne s'effaceront point de ma pensée. C'était en 1886. Après quelques années de germination muette, les fleurs merveilleuses de l'art russe venaient de surgir de la terre de France. Les traductions de Tolstoï et de Dostoïevski paraissaient dans toutes les maisons d'éditions à la fois, avec une hâte fiévreuse. De 1885 à 1887 furent publiés à Paris Guerre et Paix, Anna Karénine, Enfance et Adolescence, Polikouchka, la Mort d'Ivan Iliitch, les nouvelles du Caucase et les contes populaires. En quelques mois, en quelques semaines, se découvrait à nos yeux l'œuvre de toute une grande vie, où se reflétait un peuple, un monde nouveau.
U||Je venais d'entrer à l'École Normale. Nous étions, mes camarades et moi, bien différents les uns des autres. Dans notre petit groupe, où se trouvaient réunis des esprits réalistes et ironiques comme le philosophe Georges Dumas, des poètes tout brûlants de passion pour la Renaissance italienne comme Suarès, des fidèles de la tradition classique, des Stendhaliens et des Wagnériens, des athées et des mystiques, il s'élevait bien des discussions, il y avait bien des désaccords; mais pendant quelques mois, l'amour de Tolstoï nous réunit presque tous. Chacun l'aimait pour des raisons différentes: car chacun s'y retrouvait soi-même; et pour tous c'était une révélation de la vie, une porte qui s'ouvrait sur l'immense univers. Autour de nous, dans nos familles, dans nos provinces, la grande voix venue des confins de l'Europe éveillait les mêmes sympathies, parfois inattendues. Une fois, j'entendis des bourgeois de mon Nivernais, qui ne s'intéressaient point à l'art et ne lisaient presque rie
U||n, parler de la Mort d'Ivan Iliitch avec une émotion concentrée.
U||J'ai lu chez d'éminents critiques cette thèse que Tolstoï devait le meilleur de sa pensée à nos écrivains romantiques: à George Sand, à Victor Hugo. Sans discuter l'invraisemblance qu'il y aurait à parler d'une influence de George Sand sur Tolstoï, qui ne la pouvait souffrir, et sans nier l'influence beaucoup plus réelle qu'ont exercée sur lui J.-J. Rousseau et Stendhal, c'est bien mal se douter de la grandeur de Tolstoï et de la puissance de sa fascination sur nous que de l'attribuer à ses idées. Le cercle d'idées dans lequel se meut l'art est des plus limités. Sa force n'est pas en elles, mais dans l'expression qu'il leur donne, dans l'accent personnel, dans l'empreinte de l'artiste, dans l'odeur de sa vie.
U||Que les idées de Tolstoï fussent ou non empruntées—nous le verrons par la suite—jamais voix pareille à la sienne n'avait encore retenti en Europe. Comment expliquer autrement le frémissement d'émotion que nous éprouvions alors à entendre cette musique de l'âme, que nous attendions depuis si longtemps et dont nous avions besoin? La mode n'était pour rien dans notre sentiment. La plupart d'entre nous n'ont, comme moi, connu le livre d'Eugène-Melchior de Vogüé sur le Roman russe qu'après avoir lu Tolstoï; et son admiration nous a paru pâle auprès de la nôtre. M. de Vogüé jugeait surtout en littérateur. Mais nous, c'était trop peu pour nous d'admirer l'œuvre: nous la vivions, elle était nôtre. Nôtre, par sa vie ardente, par sa jeunesse de cœur. Nôtre, par son désenchantement ironique, sa clairvoyance impitoyable, sa hantise de la mort. Nôtre, par ses rêves d'amour fraternel et de paix entre les hommes. Nôtre, par son réquisitoire terrible contre les mensonges de la civilisati
U||on. Et par son réalisme, et par son mysticisme. Par son souffle de nature, par son sens des forces invisibles, son vertige de l'infini.
U||Ces livres ont été pour nous ce que Werther a été pour sa génération: le miroir magnifique de nos puissances et de nos faiblesses, de nos espoirs et de nos terreurs. Nous ne nous inquiétions point de mettre d'accord toutes ces contradictions, ni surtout de faire rentrer cette âme multiple, où résonnait l'univers, dans d'étroites catégories religieuses ou politiques, comme font tels de ceux qui, à l'exemple de Paul Bourget, au lendemain de la mort de Tolstoï, ont ramené le poète homérique de Guerre et Paix à l'étiage de leurs passions de partis. Comme si nos coteries, d'un jour, pouvaient être la mesure d'un génie!... Et que m'importe à moi que Tolstoï soit ou non de mon parti! M'inquiété-je de quel parti furent Dante et Shakespeare, pour respirer leur souffle et boire leur lumière?
U||Nous ne nous disions point, comme ces critiques d'aujourd'hui: «Il y a deux Tolstoï, celui d'avant la crise, celui d'après la crise; l'un est le bon, et l'autre ne l'est point.» Pour nous, il n'y en a eu qu'un, nous l'aimions tout entier. Car nous sentions, d'instinct, que dans de telles âmes tout se tient, tout est lié.
U||Ce que notre instinct sentait, sans l'expliquer, c'est à notre raison de le prouver aujourd'hui. Nous le pouvons, à présent que cette longue vie, arrivée à son terme, s'expose aux yeux de tous, sans voiles et devenue soleil, dans le ciel de l'esprit. Ce qui nous frappe aussitôt, c'est à quel point elle resta la même, du commencement à la fin, en dépit des barrières qu'on a voulu y élever, de place en place,—en dépit de Tolstoï lui-même, qui, en homme passionné, était enclin à croire, quand il aimait, quand il croyait, qu'il aimait, qu'il croyait pour la première fois, et qui datait de là le commencement de sa vie. Commencement. Recommencement. Combien de fois la même crise, les mêmes luttes se sont produites en lui! On ne saurait parler de l'unité de sa pensée—elle ne fut jamais une—mais de la persistance en elle des mêmes éléments divers, tantôt alliés, tantôt ennemis, plus souvent ennemis. L'unité, elle n'est point dans l'esprit ni dans le cœur d'un Tolstoï, elle est 
U||dans le combat de ses passions en lui, elle est dans la tragédie de son art et de sa vie.
U||Art et vie sont unis. Jamais œuvre ne fut plus intimement mêlée à la vie; elle a presque constamment un caractère autobiographique; depuis l'âge de vingt-cinq ans, elle nous fait suivre Tolstoï, pas à pas, dans les expériences contradictoires de sa carrière aventureuse. Son Journal, commencé avant l'âge de vingt ans et continué jusqu'à sa mort[1], les notes fournies par lui à M. Birukov[2], complètent cette connaissance et permettent non seulement de lire presque jour par jour dans la conscience de Tolstoï, mais de faire revivre le monde où son génie a pris racine et les âmes dont son âme s'est nourrie.
U||Une riche hérédité. Une double race (les Tolstoï et les Volkonski), très noble et très ancienne, qui se vantait de remonter à Rurik et comptait dans ses annales des compagnons de Pierre le Grand, des généraux de la guerre de Sept Ans, des héros des luttes napoléoniennes, des Décembristes, des déportés politiques. Des souvenirs de famille, auxquels Tolstoï a dû quelques-uns des types les plus originaux de Guerre et Paix: le vieux prince Bolkonski, son grand-père maternel, un représentant attardé de l'aristocratie du temps de Catherine II, voltairienne et despotique; le prince Nicolas-Grégorévitch Volkonski, un cousin-germain de sa mère, blessé à Austerlitz et ramassé sur le champ de bataille, sous les yeux de Napoléon, comme le prince André; son père, qui avait quelques traits de Nicolas Rostov[3]; sa mère, la princesse Marie, la douce laide aux beaux yeux, dont la bonté illumine Guerre et Paix.
U||Il ne connut guère ses parents. Les charmants récits d'Enfance et Adolescence ont, ainsi que l'on sait, peu de réalité. Sa mère mourut quand il n'avait pas encore deux ans. Il ne put donc se rappeler la chère figure, que le petit Nicolas Irténiev évoque à travers un voile de larmes, la figure au lumineux sourire, qui répandait la joie autour d'elle....
U||Ah! si je pouvais entrevoir ce sourire dans les moments difficiles, je ne saurais pas ce que c'est que le chagrin...[4].
U||Mais elle lui transmit sans doute sa franchise parfaite, son indifférence à l'opinion et son don merveilleux de raconter des histoires qu'elle inventait.
U||De son père, il put garder du moins quelques souvenirs. C'était un homme aimable et moqueur, aux yeux tristes, qui vivait sur ses terres, d'une existence indépendante et dénuée d'ambition. Tolstoï avait neuf ans lorsqu'il le perdit. Cette mort lui fit «comprendre pour la première fois l'amère vérité et remplit son âme de désespoir[5]».—Première rencontre de l'enfant avec le spectre d'effroi, qu'une partie de sa vie devait être consacrée à combattre, et l'autre à célébrer, en le transfigurant.... La trace de cette angoisse est marquée en quelques traits inoubliables des derniers chapitres d'Enfance, où les souvenirs sont transposés pour le récit de la mort et de l'enterrement de la mère.
U||Ils restaient cinq enfants, dans la vieille maison de Iasnaïa Poliana[6], où Léon-Nikolaievitch était né, le 28 août 1828, et qu'il ne devait quitter que pour mourir, quatre-vingt-deux ans après. La plus jeune, une fille, Marie, qui plus tard se fit religieuse (ce fut auprès d'elle que Tolstoï se réfugia, mourant, quand il s'enfuit de sa maison et des siens).—Quatre fils: Serge, égoïste et charmant, «sincère à un degré que je n'ai jamais vu atteindre»;—Dmitri, passionné, concentré, qui plus tard, étudiant, devait se livrer aux pratiques religieuses avec emportement, sans souci de l'opinion, jeûnant, recherchant les pauvres, hébergeant les infirmes, puis soudain se jetant dans la débauche, avec la même violence, ensuite rongé de remords, rachetant et prenant chez lui une fille qu'il avait connue dans une maison publique, et mourant de phtisie à vingt-neuf ans[7];—Nicolas, l'aîné, le frère le plus aimé, qui avait hérité de la mère son imagination pour conter des histoires
8|| ironique, timide et fin, plus tard officier au Caucase, où il prit l'habitude de l'alcoolisme, plein de tendresse chrétienne, lui aussi, vivant dans des taudis, partageant avec les pauvres tout ce qu'il possédait. Tourgueniev disait de lui «qu'il mettait en pratique cette humilité devant la vie, que son frère Léon se contentait de développer en théorie».
U||Auprès des orphelins, deux femmes d'un grand cœur: la tante Tatiana[9], «qui avait deux vertus, dit Tolstoï: le calme et l'amour». Toute sa vie n'était qu'amour. Elle se dévouait sans cesse....
U||Elle m'a fait connaître le plaisir moral d'aimer....
U||L'autre, la tante Alexandra, qui servait toujours les autres, et évitait d'être servie, se passait de domestiques, avait pour occupations favorites la lecture de la vie des saints, les causeries avec les pèlerins et avec les innocents. De ces innocents et innocentes, plusieurs vivaient dans la maison. Une d'elles, une vieille pèlerine, qui récitait des psaumes, était marraine de la sœur de Tolstoï. Un autre, Gricha, ne savait que prier et pleurer....
U||O grand chrétien Gricha! Ta foi était si forte que tu sentais l'approche de Dieu, ton amour était si ardent que les paroles coulaient de tes lèvres, sans que ta raison les contrôlât. Et comme tu célébrais Sa magnificence, quand, ne trouvant pas de paroles, tout en larmes, tu te prosternais sur le sol!...[10]
U||Qui ne voit la part que toutes ces humbles âmes ont eue à la formation de Tolstoï? Il semble qu'en elles s'ébauche et s'essaye le Tolstoï de la fin. Leurs prières, leur amour ont jeté dans l'esprit de l'enfant les semences de foi, dont le vieillard devait voir se lever la moisson.
U||Sauf de l'innocent Gricha, Tolstoï, dans ses récits d'Enfance, ne parle point de ces modestes collaborateurs qui l'aidèrent à construire son âme. Mais, en revanche, comme elle transparaît au travers du livre, cette âme d'enfant, «ce cœur pur et aimant, tel un rayon clair, qui découvrait toujours chez les autres leurs meilleures qualités», cette tendresse extrême! Heureux, il pense au seul homme qu'il sache malheureux, il pleure et il voudrait se dévouer pour lui. Il embrasse un vieux cheval, il lui demande pardon de l'avoir fait souffrir. Il est heureux d'aimer, même n'étant pas aimé. Déjà l'on aperçoit les germes de son futur génie: son imagination, qui le fait pleurer, de ses propres histoires; sa tête toujours en travail, qui toujours cherche à penser ce à quoi pensent les gens; sa faculté précoce d'observation et de souvenir[11]; ce regard attentif qui scrute les physionomies, au milieu de son deuil, et la vérité de leur douleur. A cinq ans, il sentit, dit-il, pour la premièr
U||e fois, «que la vie n'est pas un amusement, mais une besogne très lourde[12]».
U||Heureusement il l'oubliait. En ce temps-là, il se berçait de contes populaires, des bylines russes, ces rêves mythiques et légendaires, des récits de la Bible,—surtout de la sublime Histoire de Joseph, que, vieillard, il donnait encore pour le modèle de l'art,—et des Mille et une Nuits, que, chaque soir, chez sa grand mère, récitait un conteur aveugle, assis sur le rebord de la fenêtre.
U||Il fit ses études à Kazan[13]. Études médiocres. On disait des trois frères[14]: «Serge veut et peut. Dmitri veut et ne peut pas. Léon ne veut pas et ne peut pas».
U||Il passait par ce qu'il nomma «le désert de l'adolescence». Désert de sable, où souffle par rafales un vent brûlant de folie. Sur cette période, les récits d'Adolescence et surtout de Jeunesse sont riches en confessions intimes. Il est seul. Son cerveau est dans un état de fièvre perpétuelle. Pendant un an, il retrouve pour son compte et essaie tous les systèmes[15]. Stoïcien, il s'inflige des tortures physiques. Épicurien, il se débauche. Puis, il croit à la métempsycose. Il finit par tomber dans un nihilisme dément: il lui semble que s'il se retournait assez vite, il pourrait voir face à face le néant. Il s'analyse, il s'analyse....
U||Je ne pensais plus à une chose, je pensais que je pensais à une chose....[16]
U||Cette analyse perpétuelle, cette machine à raisonner, qui tournait dans le vide, lui restera comme une habitude dangereuse, qui, dit-il, «lui nuit souvent dans la vie», mais où son art a puisé des ressources inouïes[17].
U||A ce jeu, il avait perdu toutes ses convictions: il le pensait, du moins. A seize ans, il cessa de prier et d'aller à l'église[18]. Mais la foi n'était pas morte, elle couvait seulement:
U||Pourtant je croyais en quelque chose. En quoi? Je ne pourrais le dire. Je croyais encore en Dieu, ou plutôt je ne le niais pas. Mais quel Dieu? Je l'ignorais. Je ne niais pas non plus le Christ et sa doctrine; mais en quoi consistait cette doctrine, je n'aurais su le dire[19].
U||Il était pris, par moments, de rêves de bonté. Il voulait vendre sa voiture, en donner l'argent aux pauvres, leur faire le sacrifice d'un dixième de sa fortune, se passer de domestiques.... «Car ce sont des hommes comme moi[20].» Il écrivait, pendant une maladie[21], des Règles de vie. Il s'y assignait naïvement le devoir de «tout étudier et tout approfondir: droit, médecine, langues, agriculture, histoire, géographie, mathématiques, d'atteindre le plus haut degré de perfection en musique et en peinture».... Il avait «la conviction que la destinée de l'homme était dans son perfectionnement incessant».
U||Mais, insensiblement, sous la poussée de ses passions d'adolescent, d'une sensualité violente et d'un immense amour-propre[22], cette foi dans la perfection déviait, perdait son caractère désintéressé, devenait pratique et matérielle. S'il voulait perfectionner sa volonté, son corps et son esprit, c'était afin de vaincre le monde et d'imposer l'amour[23]. Il voulait plaire.
U||Ce n'était pas aisé. Il avait alors une laideur simiesque: face brutale, longue et lourde, cheveux courts, plantés bas, petits yeux qui se fixent sur vous avec dureté, enfouis dans des cavités sombres, large nez, grosses lèvres qui avancent, et de vastes oreilles[24]. Ne pouvant se donner le change sur cette laideur qui, lorsqu'il était enfant, lui causait déjà des crises de désespoir[25], il prétendit réaliser l'idéal de «l'homme comme il faut[26]». Cet idéal le conduisit, pour faire comme les autres «hommes comme il faut», à jouer, à s'endetter stupidement et à se débaucher tout à fait[27].
U||Une chose le sauva toujours: son absolue sincérité.
U||—Savez-vous pourquoi je vous aime plus que les autres? dit Nekhludov à son ami. Vous avez une qualité étonnante et rare: la franchise.
U||—Oui, je dis toujours les choses que j'ai même honte à m'avouer[28].
U||Dans ses pires égarements, il se juge avec une clairvoyance impitoyable.
U||«Je vis tout à fait bestialement, écrit-il dans son Journal, je suis tout déprimé.»
U||Et, avec sa manie d'analyse, il note minutieusement les causes de ses erreurs:
U||1º Indécision ou manque d'énergie;—2º Duperie de soi-même;—3º Précipitation;—4º Fausse honte;—5º Mauvaise humeur;—6º Confusion;—7º Esprit d'imitation;—8º Versatilité;—9º Irréflexion.
U||Cette même indépendance de jugement, il l'applique, encore étudiant, à la critique des conventions sociales et des superstitions intellectuelles. Il bafoue la science universitaire, refuse tout sérieux aux études historiques, et se fait mettre aux arrêts pour son audace de pensée. A cette époque, il découvre Rousseau, les Confessions, Émile. C'est un coup de foudre.
U||Je lui rendais un culte. Je portais au cou son portrait en médaille comme une image sainte[29].
U||Ses premiers essais philosophiques sont des commentaires sur Rousseau (1846-7).
U||Cependant, dégoûté de l'Université et des hommes «comme il faut», il revient se terrer dans ses champs, à Iasnaïa Poliana (1847-1851); il reprend contact avec le peuple; il prétend lui venir en aide, en être le bienfaiteur et l'éducateur. Ses expériences de ce temps ont été racontées dans une de ses premières œuvres, la Matinée d'un Seigneur (1852), une remarquable nouvelle, dont le héros est son prête-nom favori, le prince Nekhludov[30].
U||Nekhludov a vingt ans. Il a laissé l'Université pour se consacrer à ses paysans. Voici un an qu'il travaille à leur faire du bien; et, dans une visite au village, nous le voyons qui se heurte à l'indifférence railleuse, à la méfiance enracinée, à la routine, à l'insouciance, au vice, à l'ingratitude. Tous ses efforts sont vains. Il rentre découragé, et il songe à ses rêves d'il y a un an, à son généreux enthousiasme, à «son idée que l'amour et le bien étaient le bonheur et la vérité, le seul bonheur et la seule vérité possibles en ce monde». Il se sent vaincu. Il est honteux et lassé.
U||Assis devant le piano, sa main inconsciemment effleura les touches. Un accord sortit, puis un second, un troisième... Il se mit à jouer. Les accords n'étaient pas tout à fait réguliers; souvent ils étaient ordinaires jusqu'à la banalité et ne décelaient aucun talent musical; mais il y trouvait un plaisir indéfinissable, triste. A chaque changement d'harmonies, avec un battement de cœur, il attendait ce qui allait sortir, et il suppléait vaguement par l'imagination à ce qui faisait défaut. Il entendait le chœur, l'orchestre... Et son principal plaisir lui venait de l'activité forcée de l'imagination, qui lui présentait sans liens, mais avec une clarté étonnante, les images et les scènes les plus variées du passé et de l'avenir....
U||Il revoit les moujiks vicieux, méfiants, menteurs, paresseux et butés, avec qui il causait tout à l'heure; mais il les revoit, cette fois, avec ce qu'ils ont de bon, non plus avec leurs vices; il pénètre en leur cœur par l'intuition de l'amour; il lit en eux leur patience, leur résignation au sort qui les écrase, leur pardon pour les injures, leur affection familiale et les causes de leur attachement routinier et pieux au passé. Il évoque leurs journées de bon travail, fatigant et sain....
U||«C'est beau, murmure-t-il... Pourquoi ne suis-je pas l'un d'eux?»[31]
U||Tout Tolstoï est déjà dans le héros de cette première nouvelle[32]: sa vision nette et ses illusions persistantes. Il observe les gens avec un réalisme sans défaut; mais, dès qu'il ferme les yeux, ses rêves le reprennent, et son amour des hommes.
U||Mais Tolstoï, en 1850, est moins patient que Nekhludov. Iasnaïa l'a déçu; il est las du peuple, comme de l'élite; son rôle lui pèse: il n'y tient plus. D'ailleurs ses créanciers le harcèlent. En 1851, il s'enfuit au Caucase, à l'armée, auprès de son frère Nicolas, officier.
U||A peine arrivé dans les montagnes sereines, il se ressaisit, il retrouve Dieu:
U||La nuit dernière[33], j'ai à peine dormi... Je me suis mis à prier Dieu. Il m'est impossible de décrire la douceur du sentiment que j'éprouvais en priant. J'ai récité les prières habituelles, et ensuite je suis resté longtemps encore à prier. Je désirais quelque chose de très grand, de très beau.... Quoi? je ne puis le dire. Je voulais me fondre avec l'Être infini, je lui demandais de me pardonner mes fautes... Mais non, je ne le demandais pas, je sentais que, puisqu'il m'accordait ce moment bienheureux, il me pardonnait. Je demandais, et en même temps je sentais que je n'avais rien à demander et que je ne pouvais pas, que je ne savais pas demander. Je l'ai remercié, mais non en paroles, non en pensée... Une heure à peine s'était écoulée que j'écoutais la voix du vice. Je me suis endormi en rêvant de la gloire et des femmes: c'était plus fort que moi.—N'importe! Je remercie Dieu pour ce moment de bonheur, pour ce qu'il m'a montré ma petitesse et ma grandeur. Je veux prier, mais je
U|| ne sais pas; je veux comprendre, mais je n'ose pas. Je m'abandonne à Ta Volonté[34]!
U||La chair n'était pas vaincue (elle ne le fut jamais); la lutte se poursuivait dans le secret du cœur, entre les passions et Dieu. Tolstoï note, dans le Journal, les trois démons qui le dévorent:
U||1º Passion du jeu. Lutte possible.
U||2º Sensualité. Lutte très difficile.
U||3º Vanité. La plus terrible de toutes.
U||Dans l'instant qu'il rêvait de vivre pour les autres et de se sacrifier, des pensées voluptueuses ou futiles l'assiégeaient: l'image de quelque femme cosaque, ou «le désespoir qu'il aurait si sa moustache gauche se soulevait plus que la droite[35]».—«N'importe!» Dieu était là, il ne le quittait plus. Le bouillonnement de la lutte même était fécond, toutes les puissances de vie en étaient exaltées.
U||Je pense que l'idée si frivole que j'ai eue d'aller faire un voyage au Caucase m'a été inspirée d'en haut. La main de Dieu m'a guidé. Je ne cesse de l'en remercier. Je sens que je suis devenu meilleur ici, et je suis fermement persuadé que tout ce qui peut m'arriver ne sera que pour mon bien, puisque c'est Dieu lui-même qui l'a voulu...[36].
U||C'est le chant d'actions de grâces de la terre au printemps. Elle se couvre de fleurs. Tout est bien, tout est beau. En 1852, le génie de Tolstoï donne ses premières fleurs: Enfance, la Matinée d'un Seigneur, l'Incursion, Adolescence; et il remercie l'Esprit de vie qui l'a fécondé[37].
U||Histoire de mon Enfance fut commencée, dans l'automne de 1851, à Tiflis, et terminée, le 2 juillet 1852, à Piatigorsk, au Caucase. Il est curieux que dans le cadre de cette nature qui l'enivrait, en pleine vie nouvelle, au milieu des risques émouvants de la guerre, occupé à découvrir un monde de caractères et de passions qui lui étaient inconnus, Tolstoï soit revenu, dans cette première œuvre, aux souvenirs de sa vie passée. Mais quand il écrivit Enfance, il était malade, son activité militaire se trouvait brusquement arrêtée; et, durant les longs loisirs de sa convalescence, seul et endolori, il était dans une disposition d'esprit sentimentale, où le passé se déroulait devant ses yeux attendris[38]. Après la tension épuisante des ingrates dernières années, il lui était doux de revivre «la période merveilleuse, innocente, poétique et joyeuse» du premier âge, et de se refaire un «cœur d'enfant, bon, sensible et capable d'amour». Au reste, avec l'ardeur de la jeunesse et ses
U|| projets illimités, avec le caractère cyclique de son imagination poétique, qui concevait rarement un sujet isolé, et dont les grands romans ne sont que les anneaux d'une longue chaîne historique, les fragments de vastes ensembles qu'il ne put jamais exécuter[39], Tolstoï, à ce moment, ne voyait dans les récits d'Enfance que les premiers chapitres d'une Histoire de quatre Époques, qui devait aussi comprendre sa vie au Caucase et sans doute aboutir à la révélation de Dieu par la nature.
U||Tolstoï a été très sévère plus tard pour ses récits d'Enfance, auxquels il a dû une partie de sa popularité.
U||—«C'est si mauvais, disait-il à M. Birukov, c'est écrit avec si peu d'honnêteté littéraire!... Il n'y a rien à en tirer.»
U||Il fut le seul de son avis. L'œuvre manuscrite, envoyée sans nom d'auteur à la grande revue russe le Sovrémennik (le Contemporain), fut aussitôt publiée (6 septembre 1852) et eut un succès général que tous les publics d'Europe ont confirmé. Cependant, malgré son charme poétique, sa finesse de touche, sa délicate émotion, on comprend qu'elle ait déplu à Tolstoï, plus tard.
U||Elle lui a déplu, pour les raisons mêmes qui firent qu'elle plaisait aux autres. Il faut bien le dire: sauf dans la notation de certains types locaux et dans un petit nombre de pages, qui frappent par le sentiment religieux ou par le réalisme dans l'émotion[40], la personnalité de Tolstoï s'y accuse très peu. Il y règne une douce, tendre sentimentalité, qui lui fut toujours antipathique, par la suite, et qu'il proscrivit de ses autres romans. Nous la reconnaissons, nous reconnaissons cet humour et ces larmes; ils viennent de Dickens. Parmi ses lectures favorites, entre quatorze et vingt et un ans, Tolstoï indique dans son Journal: «Dickens: David Copperfield. Influence considérable.» Il relit encore le volume, au Caucase.
U||Deux autres influences, qu'il signale: Sterne et Tœppfer. «J'étais alors, dit-il, sous leur inspiration[41].»
U||Qui eût pensé que les Nouvelles Genevoises avaient été le premier modèle de l'auteur de Guerre et Paix? Et pourtant, il suffit de le savoir pour retrouver, dans les récits d'Enfance, leur bonhomie affectueuse et narquoise, transplantée dans une nature plus aristocratique.
U||Tolstoï, à ses débuts, se trouvait donc être pour le public une figure de connaissance. Mais sa personnalité ne tarda pas à s'affirmer. Adolescence (1853), moins pure et moins parfaite qu'Enfance, dénote une psychologie plus originale, un sentiment très vif de la nature, et une âme tourmentée, dont Dickens et Tœppfer eussent été bien en peine. Dans la Matinée d'un Seigneur (octobre 1852)[42], le caractère de Tolstoï paraît nettement formé, avec l'intrépide sincérité de son observation et sa foi dans l'amour. Parmi les remarquables portraits de paysans qu'il peint dans cette nouvelle, on trouve déjà l'esquisse d'une des plus belles visions de ses Contes populaires: le vieillard au rucher[43], le petit vieux sous le bouleau, les mains étendues, les yeux levés, sa tête chauve luisante au soleil, autour, les abeilles dorées, volant sans le piquer, lui faisant une couronne....
U||Mais les œuvres-types de cette période sont celles qui enregistrent immédiatement ses émotions présentes: les récits du Caucase. Le premier, l'Incursion (terminé le 24 décembre 1852), s'impose par la magnificence des paysages: un lever de soleil au milieu des montagnes, sur le bord d'une rivière; un étonnant tableau nocturne, ombres et bruits notés avec une intensité saisissante; et le retour, le soir, tandis qu'au loin les cimes neigeuses disparaissent dans le brouillard violet et que les belles voix des soldats qui chantent montent dans l'air transparent. Plusieurs types de Guerre et Paix s'y essaient à la vie: le capitaine Khlopov, le vrai héros, qui ne se bat point pour son plaisir, mais parce que c'est son devoir, «une de ces physionomies russes, simples, calmes, qu'il est très facile et très agréable de regarder droit dans les yeux». Lourd, gauche, un peu ridicule, indifférent à ce qui l'entoure, lui seul ne change pas dans la bataille, où tous les autres changent; «il est exacte
U||ment comme on l'a toujours vu: les mêmes mouvements tranquilles, la même voix égale, la même expression de simplicité sur son visage naïf et lourd». Auprès de lui, le lieutenant joue les héros de Lermontov, et, très bon, fait mine de sentiments féroces. Et le pauvre petit sous-lieutenant, tout joyeux de sa première affaire, débordant de tendresse, prêt à sauter au cou de chacun, adorable et risible, se fait stupidement tuer, comme Pétia Rostov. Au milieu du tableau, la figure de Tolstoï, qui observe, sans se mêler aux pensées de ses compagnons; déjà il fait entendre son cri de protestation contre la guerre:
U||Les hommes ne peuvent-ils donc vivre à l'aise, dans ce monde si beau, sous cet incommensurable ciel étoilé? Comment peuvent-ils, ici, conserver des sentiments de méchanceté, de vengeance, la rage de détruire leurs semblables? Tout ce qu'il y a de mauvais dans le cœur humain devrait disparaître au contact de la nature, cette expression la plus immédiate du beau et du bien[44].
U||D'autres récits du Caucase, observés à cette époque, n'ont été rédigés que plus tard: en 1854-5, la Coupe en forêt[45], d'un réalisme exact, un peu froid, mais plein de notations curieuses pour la psychologie du soldat russe,—des notes pour l'avenir;—en 1856, une Rencontre au Détachement avec une connaissance de Moscou[46], un homme du monde, déchu, sous-officier dégradé, poltron, ivrogne et menteur, qui ne peut se faire à l'idée d'être tué comme un de ces soldats qu'il méprise et dont le moindre vaut cent fois mieux que lui.
U||Au-dessus de toutes ces œuvres s'élève, cime la plus haute de cette première chaîne de montagnes, un des plus beaux romans lyriques que Tolstoï ait écrits, le chant de sa jeunesse, le poème du Caucase, les Cosaques[47]. La splendeur des montagnes neigeuses qui déroulent leurs nobles lignes sur le ciel lumineux remplit de sa musique le livre tout entier. L'œuvre est unique par cette fleur du génie, «le tout-puissant dieu de la jeunesse, comme dit Tolstoï, cet élan qui ne se retrouve plus». Quel torrent printanier! Quelles effusions d'amour!
U||«J'aime, j'aime tant!... Braves! Bons!...» répétait-il, et il voulait pleurer. Pourquoi? qui était brave? qui aimait-il? Il ne le savait pas bien[48].
U||Cette ivresse du cœur coule, désordonnée. Le héros, Olénine, est venu, comme Tolstoï, se retremper au Caucase, dans la vie d'aventures; il s'éprend d'une jeune Cosaque et s'abandonne au tohu-bohu de ses aspirations contradictoires. Tantôt il pense que «le bonheur, c'est de vivre pour les autres, de se sacrifier», tantôt que «le sacrifice de soi n'est que sottise»; alors, il n'est pas loin de croire, avec le vieux cosaque Erochka, que «tout se vaut. Dieu a fait tout pour la joie de l'homme. Rien n'est péché. S'amuser avec une belle fille n'est pas un péché, c'est le salut.» Mais qu'a-t-il besoin de penser? Il suffit de vivre. La vie est tout bien, tout bonheur, la vie toute-puissante, universelle: la Vie est Dieu. Un naturisme brûlant soulève et dévore l'âme. Perdu dans la forêt, au milieu de «la végétation sauvage, de la multitude de bêtes et d'oiseaux, des nuées de moucherons, dans la verdure sombre, dans l'air parfumé et chaud, parmi de petits fossés d'eau trouble qui partout
U|| clapotaient sous le feuillage», à deux pas des embûches de l'ennemi, Olénine «est pris tout à coup par un tel sentiment de bonheur sans cause que, par une habitude d'enfance, il se signe et se met à remercier quelqu'un». Comme un fakir hindou, il jouit de se dire qu'il est seul et perdu dans ce tourbillon de vie qui l'aspire, que des myriades d'êtres invisibles guettent en ce moment sa mort, cachés de tous côtés, que ces milliers d'insectes bourdonnent autour de lui, s'appelant:
U||—«Par ici, par ici, camarades! voici quelqu'un à piquer!»
U||Et il était clair pour lui qu'ici il n'était plus un gentilhomme russe, de la société de Moscou, ami et parent de tel ou tel, mais simplement un être comme le moucheron, le faisan, le cerf, comme ceux qui vivaient, qui rôdaient maintenant autour de lui.
U||—«Comme eux, je vivrai, je mourrai. Et l'herbe poussera dessus....»
U||Et son cœur est joyeux.
U||Tolstoï vit, à cette heure de jeunesse, dans un délire de force et d'amour de la vie. Il étreint la Nature et se fond avec elle. En elle, il verse, il endort, il exalte ses chagrins, ses joies et ses amours[49]. Mais cette ivresse romantique ne porte jamais atteinte à la lucidité de son regard. Nulle part plus qu'en ce poème ardent, les paysages ne sont peints avec une telle puissance, ni les types avec plus de vérité. L'opposition de la nature et du monde, qui fait le fond du livre, et qui sera, toute sa vie, un des thèmes favoris de la pensée de Tolstoï, un article de son Credo, lui fait déjà trouver, pour fustiger la comédie du monde, quelques âpres accents de la Sonate à Kreutzer[50]. Mais il n'est pas moins véridique pour ceux qu'il aime; et les êtres de la nature, la belle Cosaque et ses amis, sont vus en pleine lumière, avec leur égoïsme, leur cupidité, leur fourberie, leurs vices.
U||Surtout, le Caucase révélait à Tolstoï les profondeurs religieuses de son être. On ne saurait assez mettre en lumière cette première Annonciation de l'Esprit de Vérité. Lui-même s'en est confié, sous le sceau du secret, à sa confidente de jeunesse, sa jeune tante Alexandra Andrejewna Tolstoï. Dans une lettre du 3 mai 1859, il lui fait sa «Profession de foi»[51]:
U||«Enfant, dit-il, je croyais avec passion et sentimentalité, sans penser. Vers quatorze ans, je commençai à réfléchir sur la vie; et, la religion ne s'accordant pas avec mes théories, je considérai comme un mérite de la détruire... Tout était clair pour moi, logique, bien distribué en des compartiments; et pour la religion, il n'y avait aucune place... Puis, vint le temps où la vie ne m'offrait plus aucun secret, mais où elle commença à perdre tout son sens. En ce temps—c'était au Caucase—j'étais solitaire et malheureux. Je tendis toutes les forces de mon esprit, comme on ne peut le faire qu'une fois en sa vie... C'était un temps de martyre et de félicité. Jamais, ni avant, ni après, je n'ai atteint à une telle hauteur de pensée, je n'ai vu aussi profond que pendant ces deux années. Et tout ce que j'ai trouvé alors restera ma conviction... En ces deux ans de travail spirituel persistant, j'ai découvert une simple, une vieille vérité, mais que je sais maintenant, comme personne
U|| ne le sait: je découvris qu'il y a une immortalité, qu'il y a un amour, et qu'on doit vivre pour les autres, afin d'être éternellement heureux. Ces découvertes me jetèrent dans l'étonnement, par leur ressemblance avec la religion chrétienne; et, au lieu de chercher à découvrir plus avant, je me mis à chercher dans l'Évangile. Mais je trouvai peu. Je ne trouvai ni Dieu, ni le Sauveur, ni les Sacrements, rien... Mais je cherchais, de toutes, toutes, toutes les forces de mon âme, et je pleurais, et je me torturais, et je ne désirais rien que la vérité... Ainsi, je suis resté seul, avec ma religion[52].»
U||En novembre 1853, la guerre avait été déclarée à la Turquie. Tolstoï se fit nommer à l'armée de Roumanie, puis il passa à l'armée de Crimée et arriva le 7 novembre 1854 à Sébastopol. Il brûlait d'enthousiasme et de foi patriotique. Il fit bravement son devoir et fut souvent en danger, surtout en avril-mai 1855, où il était, un jour sur trois, de service à la batterie du 4e bastion.
U||A vivre pendant des mois dans une exaltation et un tremblement perpétuels, en tête-à-tête avec la mort, son mysticisme religieux se raviva. Il a des entretiens avec Dieu. En avril 1855, il note dans son Journal une prière à Dieu, pour le remercier de sa protection dans le danger et pour le supplier de la lui continuer, «afin d'atteindre le but éternel et glorieux de l'existence, qui m'est inconnu encore...». Ce but de sa vie, ce n'était point l'art, c'était déjà la religion. Le 5 mars 1855, il écrivait:
U||J'ai été amené à une grande idée, à la réalisation de laquelle je me sens capable de consacrer toute ma vie. Cette idée, c'est la fondation d'une nouvelle religion, la religion du Christ, mais purifiée des dogmes et des mystères.... Agir en claire conscience, afin d'unir les hommes par la religion[53].
U||Ce sera le programme de sa vieillesse.
U||Cependant, pour se distraire des spectacles qui l'entouraient, il s'était remis à écrire. Comment put-il trouver la liberté d'esprit nécessaire pour composer, sous la grêle d'obus, la troisième partie de ses Souvenirs: Jeunesse? Le livre est chaotique, et l'on peut attribuer aux conditions dans lesquelles il prit naissance son désordre et parfois une certaine sécheresse d'analyses abstraites, avec des divisions et des subdivisions à la manière de Stendhal[54]. Mais on admire sa calme pénétration du fouillis de pensées et de rêves confus qui se pressent dans un jeune cerveau. L'œuvre est d'une rare franchise avec soi-même. Et, par instants, que de fraîcheur poétique, dans le joli tableau du printemps à la ville, dans le récit de la confession et de la course au couvent pour le péché oublié! Un panthéisme passionné donne à certaines pages une beauté lyrique, dont les accents rappellent les récits du Caucase. Ainsi, la description de cette nuit d'été:
U||L'éclat tranquille du lumineux croissant. L'étang brillant. Les vieux bouleaux, dont les branches chevelues s'argentaient d'un côté, au clair de lune, et, de l'autre, couvraient de leurs ombres noires les buissons et la route. Le cri de la caille derrière l'étang. Le bruit à peine perceptible de deux vieux arbres qui se frôlent. Le bourdonnement des moustiques et la chute d'une pomme qui tombe sur les feuilles sèches, les grenouilles qui sautent jusque sur les marches de la terrasse, et dont le dos verdâtre brille sous un rayon de lune.... La lune monte; suspendue dans le ciel clair, elle remplit l'espace; l'éclat superbe de l'étang devient encore plus brillant; les ombres se font plus noires, la lumière plus transparente.... Et moi, humble vermisseau, déjà souillé de toutes les passions humaines, mais avec toute la force immense de l'amour, il me semblait en ce moment que la nature, la lune et moi, nous n'étions qu'un[55].
U||Mais la réalité présente parlait plus haut que les rêves du passé; elle s'imposait, impérieuse. Jeunesse resta inachevée; et le capitaine en second comte Léon Tolstoï, dans le blindage de son bastion, au grondement de la canonnade, au milieu de sa compagnie, observait les vivants et les mourants, et notait leurs angoisses et les siennes dans ses inoubliables récits de Sébastopol.
U||Ces trois récits—Sébastopol en décembre 1854, Sébastopol en mai 1855, Sébastopol en août 1855,—sont confondus d'ordinaire dans le même jugement. Cependant, ils sont bien différents entre eux. Surtout le second récit, par le sentiment et l'art, se distingue des deux autres. Ceux-ci sont dominés par le patriotisme: sur le second plane une implacable vérité.
U||On dit qu'après avoir lu le premier récit[56], la tsarine pleura et que le tsar ordonna, dans son admiration, de traduire ces pages en français et d'envoyer l'auteur à l'abri du danger. On le comprend aisément. Rien ici qui n'exalte la patrie et la guerre. Tolstoï vient d'arriver; son enthousiasme est intact; il nage dans l'héroïsme. Il n'aperçoit encore chez les défenseurs de Sébastopol ni ambition ni amour-propre, nul sentiment mesquin. C'est pour lui une épopée sublime, dont les héros «sont dignes de la Grèce». D'autre part, ces notes ne témoignent d'aucun effort d'imagination, d'aucun essai de représentation objective; l'auteur se promène à travers la ville; il voit avec lucidité, mais raconte dans une forme qui manque de liberté: «Vous voyez.... Vous entrez... Vous remarquez....» C'est du grand reportage, avec de belles impressions de nature.
U||Tout autre est la seconde scène: Sébastopol en mai 1855. Dès les premières lignes, on lit:
U||Des milliers d'amours-propres humains se sont ici heurtés, ou apaisés dans la mort....
U||Et plus loin:
U||... Et comme il y avait beaucoup d'hommes, il y avait beaucoup de vanités.... Vanité, vanité, partout la vanité, même à la porte du tombeau! C'est la maladie particulière à notre siècle.... Pourquoi les Homère et les Shakespeare parlent-ils de l'amour, de la gloire, des souffrances, et pourquoi la littérature de notre siècle n'est-elle que l'histoire sans fin des vaniteux et des snobs?
U||Le récit, qui n'est plus une simple relation de l'auteur, mais qui met en scène directement les passions et les hommes, montre ce qui se cache sous l'héroïsme. Le clair regard désabusé de Tolstoï fouille au fond des cœurs de ses compagnons d'armes; en eux ainsi qu'en lui, il lit l'orgueil, la peur, la comédie du monde qui continue de se jouer, à deux doigts de la mort. Surtout la peur est avouée, dépouillée de ses voiles et montrée toute nue. Ces transes perpétuelles[57], cette obsession de la mort sont analysées sans pudeur, sans pitié, avec une terrible sincérité. A Sébastopol, Tolstoï a appris à perdre tout sentimentalisme, «cette compassion vague, féminine, pleurnicheuse», comme il dit avec dédain. Et jamais son génie d'analyse, dont on a vu s'éveiller l'instinct pendant ses années d'adolescence et qui prendra parfois un caractère presque morbide[58], n'a atteint à l'intensité suraiguë et hallucinée du récit de la mort de Praskhoukhine. Il y a là deux pages entières c
U||onsacrées à décrire ce qui se passe dans l'âme du malheureux, pendant la seconde où la bombe est tombée et siffle avant d'éclater,—et une page sur ce qui se passe en lui, après qu'elle a éclaté et qu'«il a été tué sur le coup par un éclat reçu en pleine poitrine[59]»!
U||Comme des entr'actes d'orchestre au milieu du drame, s'ouvrent dans ces scènes de bataille de larges éclaircies de nature, des trouées de lumière, la symphonie du jour qui se lève sur le splendide paysage où agonisent des milliers d'hommes. Et le chrétien Tolstoï, oubliant le patriotisme de son premier récit, maudit la guerre impie:
U||Et ces hommes, des chrétiens qui professent la même grande loi d'amour et de sacrifice, en regardant ce qu'ils ont fait, ne tombent pas à genoux, repentants, devant Celui qui, en leur donnant la vie, a mis dans l'âme de chacun, avec la peur de la mort, l'amour du bien et du beau! Ils ne s'embrassent pas, avec des larmes de joie et de bonheur, comme des frères!
U||Au moment de terminer cette nouvelle, dont l'accent a une âpreté qu'aucune de ses œuvres encore n'avait montrée, Tolstoï se sent pris d'un doute. A-t-il eu tort de parler?
U||Un doute pénible m'étreint. Peut-être ne fallait-il pas dire cela. Peut-être ce que je dis est une de ces méchantes vérités qui, cachées inconsciemment dans l'âme de chacun, ne doivent pas être exprimées pour ne pas devenir nuisibles, comme la lie qu'il ne faut pas agiter, sous peine de gâter le vin. Où est l'expression du mal qu'il faut éviter? Où l'expression du beau qu'il faut imiter? Qui est le malfaiteur et qui est le héros? Tous sont bons et tous sont mauvais....
U||Mais il se ressaisit fièrement:
U||Le héros de ma nouvelle, que j'aime de toutes les forces de mon âme, que je tâche de montrer dans toute sa beauté, et qui toujours fut, est et sera beau, c'est la Vérité.
U||Après avoir lu ces pages[60], le directeur du Sovrémennik, Nekrasov, écrivait à Tolstoï:
U||Voilà précisément ce qu'il faut à la société russe d'aujourd'hui: la vérité, la vérité, dont, depuis la mort de Gogol, il est si peu resté dans la littérature russe.... Cette vérité que vous apportez dans notre art est quelque chose de tout à fait nouveau chez nous. Je n'ai peur que d'une chose: que le temps et la lâcheté de la vie, la surdité et le mutisme de tout ce qui nous entoure fassent de vous ce qu'ils ont fait de la plupart d'entre nous,—qu'ils ne tuent en vous l'énergie[61].
U||Rien de pareil n'était à craindre. Le temps, qui use l'énergie des hommes ordinaires, n'a fait que tremper celle de Tolstoï. Mais, sur le moment, les épreuves de la patrie, la prise de Sébastopol, réveillèrent, avec un sentiment de douloureuse piété, le regret de sa franchise trop dure. Dans le troisième récit,—Sébastopol en août 1855,—racontant une scène d'officiers qui jouent et se querellent, il s'interrompt et dit:
U||Mais baissons vite le voile sur ce tableau. Demain, aujourd'hui peut-être, chacun de ces hommes ira joyeusement à la rencontre de la mort. Au fond de l'âme de chacun couve la noble étincelle qui fera de lui un héros.
U||Et si cette pudeur n'enlève rien de sa force au réalisme du récit, le choix des personnages montre assez les sympathies de l'auteur. L'épopée de Malakoff et sa chute héroïque se symbolisent en deux figures touchantes et fières: deux frères, dont l'un, l'aîné, le capitaine Kozeltzov, a quelques traits de Tolstoï[62]; l'autre, l'enseigne Volodia, timide et enthousiaste, avec ses fiévreux monologues, ses rêves, les larmes qui lui montent aux yeux pour un rien, larmes de tendresse, larmes d'humiliation, ses transes des premières heures qu'il passe au bastion (le pauvre petit a encore la peur de l'obscurité, et, quand il est couché, il se cache la tête dans sa capote), l'oppression que lui cause le sentiment de sa solitude et de l'indifférence des autres, puis, quand l'heure est venue, sa joie dans le danger. Celui-ci appartient au groupe des poétiques figures d'adolescents (Pétia de Guerre et Paix, le sous-lieutenant d'Incursion) qui, le cœur plein d'amour, font la guerre en riant et se bri
U||sent soudain, sans comprendre, à la mort. Les deux frères tombent frappés, le même jour,—le dernier jour de la défense.—Et la nouvelle se termine par ces lignes, où gronde une rage patriotique:
U||L'armée quittait la ville. Et chaque soldat, en regardant Sébastopol abandonné, avec une amertume indicible dans le cœur, soupirait et montrait le poing à l'ennemi[63].
U||Quand, sorti de cet enfer, où pendant une année il avait touché le fond des passions, des vanités et de la douleur humaine, Tolstoï se retrouva, en novembre 1855, parmi les hommes de lettres de Pétersbourg, il éprouva pour eux un sentiment d'écœurement et de mépris. Tout lui semblait en eux mesquin et mensonger. Ces hommes, qui de loin lui apparaissaient dans une auréole d'art,—Tourgueniev, qu'il avait admiré et à qui il venait de dédier la Coupe en forêt,—vus de près, le déçurent amèrement. Un portrait de 1856 le représente au milieu d'eux: Tourgueniev, Gontcharov, Ostrovsky, Grigorovitch, Droujinine. Il frappe, dans le laisser-aller des autres, par son air ascétique et dur, sa tête osseuse, aux joues creusées, ses bras croisés avec raideur. Debout, en uniforme, derrière ces littérateurs, «il semble, comme l'écrit spirituellement Suarès, plutôt garder ces gens que faire partie de leur société: on le dirait prêt à les reconduire en prison[64]».
U||Cependant, tous s'empressaient autour du jeune confrère qui leur arrivait, entouré de la double gloire de l'écrivain et du héros de Sébastopol. Tourgueniev, qui avait «pleuré et crié: Hourra!» en lisant les scènes de Sébastopol, lui tendait fraternellement la main. Mais les deux hommes ne pouvaient s'entendre. Si tous deux voyaient le monde avec la même clarté de regard, ils mêlaient à leur vision la couleur de leurs âmes ennemies: l'une, ironique et vibrante, amoureuse et désenchantée, dévote de la beauté; l'autre, violente, orgueilleuse, tourmentée d'idées morales, grosse d'un Dieu caché.
U||Surtout, ce que Tolstoï ne pardonnait point à ces littérateurs, c'était de se croire une caste élue, la tête de l'humanité. Il entrait dans son antipathie pour eux beaucoup de l'orgueil du grand seigneur et de l'officier vis-à-vis de bourgeois écrivassiers et libéraux[65]. C'était aussi un trait caractéristique de sa nature,—il le reconnaît lui-même,—de «s'opposer d'instinct à tous les raisonnements généralement admis[66]». Une méfiance des hommes, un mépris latent pour la raison humaine, lui faisaient partout flairer la duperie de soi-même ou des autres, le mensonge.
U||Il ne croyait jamais à la sincérité des gens. Tout élan moral lui semblait faux, et il avait l'habitude, avec son regard extraordinairement pénétrant, de cingler l'homme qui, lui paraissait-il, ne disait pas la vérité....[67]
U||Comme il écoutait! Comme il regardait son interlocuteur, du fond de ses yeux gris enfoncés dans les orbites! Avec quelle ironie se serraient ses lèvres[68]!
U||Tourgueniev disait qu'il n'avait jamais rien senti de plus pénible que ce regard aigu, qui, joint à deux ou trois mots d'une observation venimeuse, était capable de mettre en fureur.[69]
U||De violentes scènes éclatèrent, dès leurs premières rencontres, entre Tolstoï et Tourgueniev[70]. De loin, ils s'apaisaient et tâchaient de se rendre justice. Mais le temps ne fit qu'accuser la répulsion de Tolstoï pour son milieu littéraire. Il ne pardonnait pas à ces artistes le mélange de leur vie dépravée et de leurs prétentions morales.
U||J'acquis la conviction que presque tous étaient des hommes immoraux, mauvais, sans caractère, bien inférieurs à ceux que j'avais rencontrés dans ma vie de bohême militaire. Et ils étaient sûrs d'eux-mêmes et contents, comme peuvent l'être des gens tout à fait sains. Ils me dégoûtèrent[71].
U||Il se sépara d'eux. Toutefois, il garda quelque temps encore leur foi intéressée dans l'art[72]. Son orgueil y trouvait son compte. C'était une religion grassement rétribuée; elle procurait «des femmes, de l'argent, de la gloire...».
U||De cette religion, j'étais un des pontifes. Situation agréable et bien avantageuse....
U||Pour mieux s'y consacrer, il donna sa démission de l'armée (novembre 1856).
U||Mais un homme de sa trempe ne pouvait se fermer longtemps les yeux. Il croyait, il voulait croire au progrès. Il lui semblait «que ce mot signifiait quelque chose». Un voyage à l'étranger,—du 29 janvier au 30 juillet 1857,—en France, en Suisse et en Allemagne, fit s'écrouler cette foi.[73] A Paris, le 6 avril 1857, le spectacle d'une exécution capitale «lui montra le néant de la superstition du progrès...».
U||Quand je vis la tête se détacher du corps et tomber dans le panier, je compris, par toutes les forces de mon être, qu'aucune théorie sur la raison de l'ordre existant ne pouvait justifier un tel acte. Si même tous les hommes de l'univers, s'appuyant sur quelque théorie, trouvaient cela nécessaire, je saurais, moi, que c'est mal: car ce n'est pas ce que disent et font les hommes qui décide de ce qui est bien ou mal, mais mon cœur[74].
U||A Lucerne, le 7 juillet 1857, la vue d'un petit chanteur ambulant, à qui les riches Anglais, hôtes du Schweizerhof, refusaient l'aumône, lui fait inscrire dans son Journal du prince D. Nekhludov[75] son mépris pour toutes les illusions chères aux libéraux, pour ces gens «qui tracent des lignes imaginaires sur la mer du bien et du mal...».
U||Pour eux la civilisation, c'est le bien; la barbarie, le mal; la liberté, le bien; l'esclavage, le mal. Et cette connaissance imaginaire détruit les besoins instinctifs, primordiaux, les meilleurs. Et qui me définira ce qu'est la liberté, ce qu'est le despotisme, ce qu'est la civilisation, ce qu'est la barbarie? Où donc ne coexistent pas le bien et le mal? Il n'y a en nous qu'un seul guide infaillible, l'Esprit universel qui nous souffle de nous rapprocher les uns des autres.
U||De retour en Russie, à Iasnaïa, de nouveau il s'occupa des paysans.[76] Ce n'était pas qu'il se fît non plus illusion sur le peuple. Il écrit:
U||Les apologistes du peuple et de son bon sens ont beau dire, la foule est peut-être bien l'union de braves gens; mais alors ils ne s'unissent que par le côté bestial, méprisable, qui n'exprime que la faiblesse et la cruauté de la nature humaine[77].
U||Aussi n'est-ce pas à la foule qu'il s'adresse: c'est à la conscience individuelle de chaque homme, de chaque enfant du peuple. Car là est la lumière. Il fonde des écoles, sans trop savoir qu'enseigner. Pour l'apprendre, il fait un second voyage en Europe, du 3 juillet 1860 au 23 avril 1861[78].
U||Il étudie les divers systèmes pédagogiques. Est-il besoin de dire qu'il les rejette tous? Deux séjours à Marseille lui montrèrent que la véritable instruction du peuple se faisait en dehors de l'école, qu'il trouva ridicule, par les journaux, les musées, les bibliothèques, la rue, la vie, qu'il nomme «l'école inconsciente» ou «spontanée». L'école spontanée, par opposition à l'école obligatoire, qu'il regarde comme néfaste et niaise, voilà ce qu'il veut fonder, ce qu'il essaye, à son retour, à Iasnaïa Poliana[79]. Son principe est la liberté. Il n'admet point qu'une élite, «la société privilégiée libérale», impose sa science et ses erreurs au peuple, qui lui est étranger. Elle n'y a aucun droit. Cette méthode d'éducation forcée n'a jamais pu produire, dans l'Université, «des hommes dont l'humanité a besoin, mais des hommes dont a besoin la société dépravée: des fonctionnaires, des professeurs fonctionnaires, des littérateurs fonctionnaires, ou des hommes arrachés
U|| sans aucun but à leur ancien milieu, dont la jeunesse a été gâtée, et qui ne trouvent pas de place dans la vie: des libéraux irritables, maladifs[80]». Au peuple de dire ce qu'il veut! S'il ne tient pas «à l'art de lire et d'écrire que lui imposent les intellectuels», il a ses raisons pour cela: il a d'autres besoins d'esprit plus pressants et plus légitimes. Tâchez de les comprendre et aidez-le à les satisfaire!
U||Ces libres théories d'un conservateur révolutionnaire, comme il fut toujours, Tolstoï tâcha de les mettre en pratique, à Iasnaïa, où il se faisait beaucoup plus le condisciple que le maître de ses élèves[81]. En même temps, il s'efforçait d'introduire dans l'exploitation agricole un esprit plus humain. Nommé en 1861 arbitre territorial, dans le district de Krapivna, il fut le défenseur du peuple contre les abus de pouvoir des propriétaires et de l'État.
U||Mais il ne faudrait pas croire que cette activité sociale le satisfît et le remplît tout entier. Il continuait d'être la proie de passions ennemies. En dépit qu'il en eût, il aimait le monde, toujours, et il en avait besoin. Le plaisir le reprenait, par périodes; ou c'était le goût de l'action. Il risquait de se faire tuer dans des chasses à l'ours. Il jouait de grosses sommes. Il lui arrivait même de subir l'influence du milieu littéraire de Pétersbourg, qu'il méprisait. Au sortir de ces aberrations, il tombait dans des crises de dégoût. Les œuvres de cette époque portent fâcheusement les traces de cette incertitude artistique et morale. Les Deux Hussards (1856)[82] ont des prétentions à l'élégance, un air fat et mondain, qui choque chez Tolstoï. Albert, écrit à Dijon en 1857[83], est faible et bizarre, dénué de la profondeur et de la précision qui lui sont habituelles. Le Journal d'un Marqueur (1856)[84], plus frappant, mais hâtif, semble traduire l'écœurement que Tolstoï s
U||'inspire à lui-même. Le prince Nekhludov, son Doppelgänger, son double, se tue dans un tripot:
U||Il avait tout: richesse, nom, esprit, aspirations élevées; il n'avait commis aucun crime; mais il avait fait pire: il avait tué son cœur, sa jeunesse; il s'était perdu, sans même avoir une forte passion pour excuse, mais faute de volonté.
U||L'approche même de la mort ne le change pas...
U||La même inconséquence étrange, la même hésitation, la même légèreté de pensée....
U||La mort.... A cette époque, elle commence à hanter l'âme de Tolstoï. Trois Morts (1858-9)[85] annoncent déjà la sombre analyse de la Mort d'Ivan Iliitch, la solitude du mourant, sa haine pour les vivants, ses: «Pourquoi?» désespérés. Le triptyque des trois morts—la dame riche, le vieux postillon phtisique et le bouleau abattu—a de la grandeur; les portraits sont bien tracés, les images assez frappantes, bien que l'œuvre, trop vantée, soit d'une trame un peu lâche, et que la mort du bouleau manque de la poésie précise qui fait le prix des beaux paysages de Tolstoï. Dans l'ensemble, on ne sait encore ce qui l'emporte de l'art pour l'art ou de l'intention morale.
U||Tolstoï l'ignorait lui-même. Le 4 février 1859, pour son discours de réception à la Société Moscovite des Amateurs des Lettres russes, il faisait l'apologie de l'art pour l'art[86]; et c'était le président de la Société, Khomiakov, qui, après avoir salué en lui «le représentant de la littérature proprement artistique», prenait contre lui la défense de l'art social et moral[87].
U||Un an plus tard, la mort de son frère chéri, Nicolas, emporté par la phtisie[88], à Hyères, le 19 septembre 1860, bouleversait Tolstoï, au point «d'ébranler sa foi dans le bien, en tout», et lui faisait renier l'art:
U||La vérité est horrible.... Sans doute, tant qu'existe le désir de la savoir et de la dire, on tâche de la savoir et de la dire. C'est la seule chose qui me soit restée de ma conception morale. C'est la seule chose que je ferai, mais pas sous la forme de votre art. L'art, c'est le mensonge, et je ne peux plus aimer le beau mensonge[89].
U||Mais, moins de six mois après, il revenait au «beau mensonge», avec Polikouchka[90], qui est peut-être son œuvre la plus dénuée d'intentions morales, à part la malédiction latente qui pèse sur l'argent et sur son pouvoir néfaste; œuvre purement écrite pour l'art; un chef-d'œuvre d'ailleurs, auquel on ne peut reprocher que sa richesse excessive d'observation, une abondance de matériaux qui auraient pu suffire à un grand roman, et le contraste trop dur, un peu cruel, entre l'atroce dénouement et le début humoristique[91].
U||De cette époque de transition, où le génie de Tolstoï tâtonne, doute de lui-même et semble s'énerver, «sans forte passion, sans volonté directrice», comme le Nekhludov du Journal d'un Marqueur, sort l'œuvre la plus pure qui soit jamais née de lui, le Bonheur Conjugal (1859)[92]. C'est le miracle de l'amour.
U||Depuis de longues années, il était ami de la famille Bers. Il avait été amoureux tour à tour de la mère et des trois filles[93]. Ce fut définitivement de la seconde qu'il s'éprit. Mais il n'osait l'avouer. Sophie-Andréievna Bers était encore une enfant: elle avait dix-sept ans; lui, avait plus de trente ans: il se regardait comme un vieux homme, qui n'avait pas le droit d'associer sa vie usée, souillée, à celle d'une innocente jeune fille. Il résista, trois ans[94]. Plus tard, il a conté dans Anna Karénine comment il fit sa déclaration à Sophie Bers et comment elle y répondit,—en dessinant tous deux, avec de la craie sur une table, les initiales des mots qu'ils n'osaient dire. Comme Levine dans Anna Karénine, il eut la cruelle loyauté de remettre son Journal intime à sa fiancée, afin qu'elle n'ignorât rien de ses hontes passées; et, comme Kitty dans Anna, Sophie en ressentit une amère souffrance. Le 23 septembre 1862 se fit leur mariage.
U||Mais depuis trois ans déjà, ce mariage était fait dans la pensée du poète, écrivant Bonheur Conjugal[95]. Depuis trois ans, il avait déjà vécu par avance les ineffables jours de l'amour qui s'ignore, et les jours enivrés de l'amour qui se découvre, et, l'heure où les divines paroles attendues se murmurent, les larmes «d'un bonheur qui s'envole pour toujours et ne reviendra jamais»; et la réalité triomphante des premiers temps du mariage, l'égoïsme amoureux, «la joie incessante et sans cause»; puis, la fatigue qui vient, le mécontentement vague, l'ennui de la vie monotone, les deux âmes unies qui doucement se disjoignent et s'éloignent l'une de l'autre, la griserie dangereuse du monde pour la jeune femme,—coquetteries, jalousie, malentendus mortels,—l'amour voilé, perdu; enfin le tendre et triste automne du cœur, la figure de l'amour qui reparaît, pâlie, vieillie, plus touchante par ses larmes, ses rides, le souvenir des épreuves, le regret du mal que l'on se fit et des années
U|| perdues,—sérénité du soir, passage auguste de l'amour à l'amitié et du roman de la passion à la maternité.... Tout ce qui devait venir, tout, Tolstoï l'avait rêvé, goûté par avance. Et afin de le mieux vivre, il l'avait vécu en elle, en la bien-aimée. Pour la première fois,—l'unique fois peut-être dans l'œuvre de Tolstoï,—le roman se passe dans le cœur d'une femme et est raconté par elle. Avec quelle délicatesse! Beauté de l'âme qui s'enveloppe d'un voile de pudeur.... L'analyse de Tolstoï a renoncé, pour cette fois, à sa lumière un peu crue; elle ne s'acharne pas, avec fièvre, à mettre à nu la vérité. Les secrets de la vie intérieure se laissent deviner, plutôt qu'ils ne sont livrés. Le cœur et l'art de Tolstoï sont attendris. Équilibre harmonieux de la forme et de la pensée: Bonheur conjugal a la perfection d'une œuvre racinienne.
U||Le mariage, dont Tolstoï pressentait avec une clarté profonde la douceur et les troubles, devait être son salut. Il était las, malade, dégoûté de lui et de ses efforts. Aux succès éclatants qui avaient accueilli ses premières œuvres avait succédé le silence complet de la critique[96] et l'indifférence du public. Hautainement, il affectait de s'en réjouir.
U||Ma réputation a beaucoup perdu de sa popularité, qui m'attristait. Maintenant, je suis tranquille, je sais que j'ai à dire quelque chose et que j'ai la force de le dire très haut. Quant au public, qu'il pense ce qu'il voudra![97]
U||Mais il se vantait: de son art, lui-même n'était pas sûr. Sans doute, il était maître de son instrument littéraire; mais il ne savait qu'en faire. Comme il le disait, à propos de Polikouchka, «c'était un bavardage sur le premier sujet venu, par un homme qui sait tenir sa plume[98]». Ses œuvres sociales avortaient. En 1862, il démissionna de sa charge d'arbitre territorial. La même année, la police vint perquisitionner à Iasnaïa Poliana, bouleversa tout, ferma l'école. Tolstoï était alors absent, surmené; il craignait la phtisie.
U||Les querelles d'arbitrage m'étaient devenues si pénibles, le travail de l'école si vague, mes doutes qui provenaient du désir d'instruire les autres en cachant mon ignorance de ce qu'il fallait enseigner m'étaient si écœurants que je tombai malade. Peut-être serais-je arrivé alors au désespoir où je faillis succomber quinze ans plus tard, s'il n'y avait pas eu pour moi un côté inconnu de la vie qui me promettait le salut: c'était la vie de famille[99].
U||Il en jouit d'abord, avec la passion qu'il mettait à tout[100]. L'influence personnelle de la comtesse Tolstoï fut précieuse pour l'art. Bien douée littérairement[101], elle était, ainsi qu'elle le dit, «une vraie femme d'écrivain», tant elle prenait à cœur l'œuvre de son mari. Elle travaillait avec lui, écrivait sous sa dictée, recopiait ses brouillons[102]. Elle tâchait de le défendre contre son démon religieux, ce redoutable esprit qui soufflait déjà, par moments, la mort de l'art. Elle tâchait que sa porte fût close aux utopies sociales[103]. Elle réchauffait en lui le génie créateur. Elle fit plus: elle apporta à ce génie la richesse nouvelle de son âme féminine. A part de jolies silhouettes dans Enfance et Adolescence, la femme est à peu près absente des premières œuvres de Tolstoï, ou elle reste au second plan. Elle apparaît dans Bonheur conjugal, écrit sous l'influence de l'amour pour Sophie Behrs. Dans les œuvres qui suivent, les types de jeunes filles et de femme
U||s abondent et ont une vie intense, supérieure même à celle des hommes. On aime à croire que la comtesse Tolstoï a non seulement servi de modèle à son mari pour Natacha, dans Guerre et Paix[104], et pour Kitty, dans Anna Karénine, mais que, par ses confidences et sa vision propre, elle put lui être une précieuse et discrète collaboratrice. Certaines pages d'Anna Karénine[105] me semblent déceler une main de femme.
U||Grâce au bienfait de cette union, Tolstoï goûta, pendant dix ou quinze ans, une paix et une sécurité qui lui étaient depuis longtemps inconnues[106]. Alors il put, sous l'aile de l'amour, rêver et réaliser à loisir les chefs-d'œuvre de sa pensée, monuments colossaux qui dominent tout le roman du XIXe siècle: Guerre et Paix (1864-1869) et Anna Karénine (1873-1877).
U||Guerre et Paix est la plus vaste épopée de notre temps, une Iliade moderne. Un monde de figures et de passions s'y agite. Sur cet Océan humain aux flots innombrables plane une âme souveraine, qui soulève et refrène les tempêtes avec sérénité. Plus d'une fois, en contemplant cette œuvre, j'ai pensé à Homère et à Gœthe, malgré les différences énormes et d'esprit et de temps. Depuis, j'ai vu qu'en effet, à l'époque où il y travaillait, la pensée de Tolstoï se nourrissait d'Homère et de Gœthe[107]. Bien plus, dans des notes de 1865 où il classe les divers genres littéraires, il inscrit comme étant de la même famille: «Odyssée, Iliade, 1805[108]...» Le mouvement naturel de son esprit l'entraînait du roman des destinées individuelles au roman des armées et des peuples, des grands troupeaux humains où se fondent les volontés des millions d'êtres. Ses tragiques expériences du siège de Sébastopol l'acheminaient à comprendre l'âme de la nation russe et sa vie séculaire. L'i
U||mmense Guerre et Paix ne devait être, dans ses projets, que le panneau central d'une série de fresques épiques, où se déroulerait le poème de la Russie, de Pierre le Grand aux Décembristes[109].
U||Il faut, pour bien sentir la puissance de l'œuvre, se rendre compte de son unité cachée[110]. La plupart des lecteurs français, un peu myopes, n'en voient que les milliers de détails, dont la profusion les émerveille et les déroute. Ils sont perdus dans cette forêt de vie. Il faut s'élever au-dessus et embrasser du regard l'horizon libre, le cercle des bois et des champs; alors on percevra l'esprit homérique de l'œuvre, le calme des lois éternelles; le rythme imposant du souffle du destin, le sentiment de l'ensemble auquel tous les détails sont liés, et, dominant son œuvre, le génie de l'artiste, comme le Dieu de la Genèse qui flotte sur les eaux.
U||D'abord, la mer immobile. La paix, la société russe à la veille de la guerre. Les cent premières pages reflètent, avec une exactitude impassible et une ironie supérieure, le néant des âmes mondaines. Vers la centième page seulement, s'élève le cri d'un de ces morts vivants,—le pire d'entre eux, le prince Basile:
U||Nous péchons, nous trompons, et tout cela pourquoi? J'ai dépassé la cinquantaine, mon ami... Tout finit par la mort... La mort, quelle terreur!
U||Parmi ces âmes fades, menteuses et désœuvrées, capables de toutes les aberrations et des crimes, s'esquissent certaines natures plus saines:—les sincères, par naïveté maladroite comme Pierre Besoukhov, par indépendance foncière, par sentiment vieux-russe, comme Marie Dmitrievna, par fraîcheur juvénile, comme les petits Rostov;—les âmes bonnes et résignées, comme la princesse Marie;—et celles qui ne sont pas bonnes, mais fières, et que tourmente cette existence malsaine, comme le prince André.
U||Mais voici le premier frémissement des flots. L'action. L'armée russe en Autriche. La fatalité règne, nulle part plus dominatrice que dans le déchaînement des forces élémentaires,—dans la guerre. Les véritables chefs sont ceux qui ne cherchent pas à diriger, mais, comme Koutouzov ou comme Bagration, à «laisser croire que leurs intentions personnelles sont en parfait accord avec ce qui est en réalité le simple effet de la force des circonstances, de la volonté des subordonnés et des caprices du hasard». Bienfait de s'abandonner à la main du Destin! Bonheur de l'action pure, état normal et sain. Les esprits troublés retrouvent leur équilibre. Le prince André respire, commence à vivre.... Et tandis que là-bas, loin du souffle vivifiant de ces tempêtes sacrées, les deux âmes les meilleures, Pierre et la princesse Marie, sont menacées par la contagion de leur monde, par le mensonge d'amour, André, blessé à Austerlitz, a soudain, au milieu de l'ivresse de l'action, brutalement romp
U||ue, la révélation de l'immensité sereine. Étendu sur le dos, «il ne voit plus rien que très haut au-dessus de lui un ciel infini, profond, où voguaient mollement de légers nuages grisâtres».
U||Quel calme! Quelle paix! se disait-il, quelle différence avec ma course forcenée! Comment ne l'avais-je pas remarqué plus tôt, ce haut ciel? Comme je suis heureux de l'avoir enfin aperçu! Oui, tout est vide, tout est déception, excepté lui... Il n'y a rien, hors lui... Et Dieu en soit loué!
U||Cependant, la vie le reprend, et la vague retombe. Abandonnées de nouveau à elles-mêmes, dans l'atmosphère démoralisante des villes, les âmes découragées, inquiètes, errent au hasard dans la nuit. Parfois, au souffle empoisonné du monde se mêlent les effluves enivrants et affolants de la nature, le printemps, l'amour, les forces aveugles, qui rapprochent du prince André la charmante Natacha, et qui, l'instant d'après, la jettent dans les bras du premier séducteur venu. Tant de poésie, de tendresse, de pureté de cœur, que le monde a flétries! Et toujours «le grand ciel qui plane sur l'abjection outrageante de la terre». Mais les hommes ne le voient pas. Même André a oublié la lumière d'Austerlitz. Pour lui, le ciel n'est plus «qu'une voûte sombre et pesante», qui recouvre le néant.
U||Il est temps que se lève de nouveau sur ces âmes anémiées l'ouragan de la guerre. La patrie est envahie. Borodino. Grandeur solennelle de cette journée. Les inimitiés s'effacent. Dologhov embrasse son ennemi Pierre. André, blessé, pleure de tendresse et de pitié sur le malheur de l'homme qu'il haïssait le plus, Anatole Kouraguine, son voisin d'ambulance. L'unité des cœurs s'accomplit par le sacrifice passionné à la patrie et par la soumission aux lois divines.
U||Accepter l'effroyable nécessité de la guerre, sérieusement, avec austérité... L'épreuve la plus difficile est la soumission de la liberté humaine aux lois divines. La simplicité de cœur consiste dans la soumission à la volonté de Dieu.
U||L'âme du peuple russe et sa soumission au destin s'incarnent dans le généralissime Koutouzov:
U||Ce vieillard, qui n'avait plus, en fait de passions, que l'expérience, résultat des passions, et chez qui l'intelligence, destinée à grouper les faits et à en tirer des conclusions, était remplacée par une contemplation philosophique des événements, n'invente rien, n'entreprend rien; mais il écoute et se rappelle tout, il saura s'en servir au bon moment, n'entravera rien d'utile, ne permettra rien de nuisible. Il épie sur le visage de ses troupes cette force insaisissable qui s'appelle la volonté de vaincre, la victoire future. Il admet quelque chose de plus puissant que sa volonté: la marche inévitable des faits qui se déroulent devant ses yeux; il les voit, il les suit, et il sait faire abstraction de sa personne.
U||Enfin, il a le cœur russe. Ce fatalisme du peuple russe, tranquillement héroïque, se personnifie aussi dans le pauvre moujik, Platon Karataiev, simple, pieux, résigné, avec son bon sourire dans les souffrances et dans la mort. A travers les épreuves, les ruines de la patrie, les affres de l'agonie, les deux héros du livre, Pierre et André, arrivent à la délivrance morale et à la joie mystique, par l'amour et la foi, qui font voir Dieu vivant.
U||Tolstoï ne termine point là. L'épilogue, qui se passe en 1820, est une transition d'une époque à une autre, de l'âge napoléonien à l'âge des Décembristes. Il donne le sentiment de la continuité et du recommencement de la vie. Au lieu de débuter et de finir en pleine crise, Tolstoï finit, comme il a débuté, au moment où une grande vague s'efface et où la vague suivante naît. Déjà l'on aperçoit les héros à venir, les conflits qui s'élèveront entre eux et les morts qui ressuscitent dans les vivants[111].
U||J'ai tâché de dégager les grandes lignes du roman: car il est rare qu'on se donne la peine de les chercher. Mais que dire de la puissance extraordinaire de vie de ces centaines de héros, tous individuels et dessinés d'une façon inoubliable, soldats, paysans, grands seigneurs, Russes, Autrichiens et Français! Rien ne sent ici l'improvisation. Pour cette galerie de portraits, sans analogue dans toute la littérature européenne, Tolstoï a fait des esquisses sans nombre, «combiné, disait-il, des millions de projets», fouillé dans les bibliothèques, mis à contribution ses archives de famille[112], ses notes antérieures, ses souvenirs personnels. Cette préparation minutieuse assure la solidité du travail, mais ne lui enlève rien de sa spontanéité. Tolstoï travaillait, d'enthousiasme, avec une ardeur et une joie qui se communiquent au lecteur. Surtout, ce qui fait le plus grand charme de Guerre et Paix, c'est sa jeunesse de cœur. Il n'est pas une autre œuvre de Tolstoï qui soit aussi riche 
U||en âmes d'enfants et d'adolescents; et chacune est une musique, d'une pureté de source, d'une grâce qui attendrit comme une mélodie de Mozart: le jeune Nicolas Rostov, Sonia, le pauvre petit Pétia.
U||La plus exquise est Natacha. Chère petite fille, fantasque, rieuse, au cœur aimant, qu'on voit grandir auprès de soi, que l'on suit dans la vie, avec la chaste tendresse qu'on aurait pour une sœur,—qui ne croit l'avoir connue?... Nuit admirable de printemps, où Natacha, à sa fenêtre que baigne le clair de lune, rêve et parle follement, au-dessus de la fenêtre du prince André qui l'écoute.... Émotions du premier bal, amour, attente d'amour, floraison de désirs et de rêves désordonné, course en traîneau, la nuit, dans la forêt neigeuse où s'allument des lueurs fantastiques. Nature, qui vous étreint de sa trouble tendresse. Soirée à l'Opéra, monde étrange de l'art, où la raison se grise; folie du cœur, folie du corps qui se languit d'amour; douleur qui lave l'âme, divine pitié, qui veille le bien-aimé mourant.... On ne peut évoquer ces pauvres souvenirs sans l'émotion qu'on aurait à parler d'une amie, la plus aimée. Ah! qu'une telle création fait mesurer la faiblesse des type
U||s féminins dans presque tout le roman et le théâtre contemporains! La vie même est saisie, et si souple, si fluide que, d'une ligne à l'autre, il semble qu'on la voie palpiter et changer.—La princesse Marie, la laide, belle par la bonté, n'est pas une peinture moins parfaite; mais comme elle eût rougi, la fille timide et gauche, comme elles rougiront, celles qui lui ressemblent, en voyant dévoilés tous les secrets d'un cœur, qui se cache peureusement aux regards!
U||En général, les caractères de femmes sont, comme je l'indiquais, très supérieurs aux caractères d'hommes, surtout à ceux des deux héros où Tolstoï a mis sa pensée propre: la nature molle et faible de Pierre Besoukhov, la nature ardente et sèche du prince André Bolkonski. Ce sont des âmes qui manquent de centre; elles oscillent perpétuellement, plutôt qu'elles n'évoluent; elles vont d'un pôle à l'autre, sans jamais avancer. On répondra sans doute qu'en cela elles sont bien russes. Je remarquerai pourtant que des Russes ont fait les mêmes critiques. C'est à ce propos que Tourgueniev reprochait à la psychologie de Tolstoï de rester stationnaire. «Pas de vrai développement. D'éternelles hésitations, des vibrations du sentiment[113].» Tolstoï convenait lui-même qu'il avait un peu sacrifié, par moments, les caractères individuels[114] à la fresque historique.
U||Et la gloire, en effet, de Guerre et Paix est dans la résurrection de tout un âge de l'histoire, de ces migrations de peuples, de la bataille des nations. Ses vrais héros, ce sont les peuples; et derrière eux, comme derrière les héros d'Homère, les dieux qui les mènent: les forces invisibles, «les infiniment petits qui dirigent les masses», le souffle de l'Infini. Ces combats gigantesques, où un destin caché entrechoque les nations aveugles, ont une grandeur mythique. Par delà l'Iliade, on songe aux épopées hindoues[115].

U||Anna Karénine marque, avec Guerre et Paix, le sommet de cette période de maturité[116]. C'est une œuvre plus parfaite, que mène un esprit encore plus sûr de son métier artistique, plus riche aussi d'expérience, et pour qui le monde du cœur n'a plus aucun secret. Mais il y manque cette flamme de jeunesse, cette fraîcheur d'enthousiasme,—les grandes ailes de Guerre et Paix. Tolstoï n'a déjà plus la même joie à créer. La quiétude passagère des premiers temps du mariage a disparu. Dans le cercle enchanté de l'amour et de l'art, que la comtesse Tolstoï a tracé autour de lui, recommencent à se glisser les inquiétudes morales.
U||Déjà, dans les premiers chapitres de Guerre et Paix, un an après le mariage, les confidences du prince André à Pierre, au sujet du mariage, marquaient le désenchantement de l'homme qui voit dans la femme aimée l'étrangère, l'innocente ennemie, l'obstacle involontaire à son développement moral. Des lettres de 1865 annoncent le prochain retour des tourments religieux. Ce ne sont encore que de brèves menaces, qu'efface le bonheur de vivre. Mais dans les mois où Tolstoï termine Guerre et Paix, en 1869, voici une secousse plus grave:
U||Il avait quitté les siens, pour quelques jours, il visitait un domaine. Une nuit, il était couché; deux heures du matin venaient de sonner:
U||J'étais terriblement fatigué, j'avais sommeil et me sentais assez bien. Tout d'un coup, je fus saisi d'une telle angoisse, d'un tel effroi que jamais je n'ai éprouvé rien de pareil. Je te raconterai cela en détail[117]: c'était vraiment épouvantable. Je sautai du lit et ordonnai d'atteler. Pendant qu'on attelait, je m'endormis, et quand on m'éveilla, j'étais complètement remis. Hier, la même chose s'est reproduite, mais à un degré beaucoup moindre...[118].
U||Le château d'illusions, laborieusement construit par l'amour de la comtesse Tolstoï, se lézarde. Dans le vide où l'achèvement de Guerre et Paix laisse l'esprit de l'artiste, celui-ci est repris par ses préoccupations philosophiques[119] et pédagogiques: il veut écrire un Abécédaire[120] pour le peuple; il y travaille quatre ans avec acharnement; il en est plus fier que de Guerre et Paix, et, lorsqu'il l'a écrit (1872), il en récrit un second (1875). Puis, il s'entiche du grec, il l'étudie du matin au soir, il laisse tout autre travail, il découvre «le délicieux Xénophon», et Homère, le vrai Homère, non pas celui des traducteurs, «tous ces Joukhovski et ces Voss qui chantent d'une voix quelconque, gutturale, geignarde, doucereuse», mais «cet autre diable, qui chante à pleine voix, sans que jamais lui vienne en tête que quelqu'un peut l'écouter[121]».
U||Sans la connaissance du grec, pas d'instruction!... Je suis convaincu que de tout ce qui, dans le verbe humain, est vraiment beau, d'une beauté simple, jusqu'à présent je ne savais rien[122].
U||C'est une folie: il en convient. Il se remet à l'école avec une telle passion qu'il en tombe malade. Il doit, en 1871, aller faire une cure de koumiss, à Samara, chez les Bachkirs. Sauf du grec, il est mécontent de tout. A la suite d'un procès, en 1872, il parle sérieusement de vendre tout ce qu'il a en Russie et de s'installer en Angleterre. La comtesse Tolstoï se désole:
U||Si tu t'absorbes toujours dans tes Grecs, tu ne guériras pas. Ce sont eux qui te valent cette angoisse et cette indifférence pour la vie présente. Ce n'est pas en vain qu'on appelle le grec une langue morte: elle met dans un état d'esprit mort[123].
U||Enfin, après beaucoup de projets abandonnés, à peine ébauchés, le 19 mars 1873, à la grande joie de la comtesse, il commence Anna Karénine[124]. Tandis qu'il y travaille, sa vie est attristée par des deuils domestiques[125]; sa femme est malade. «La béatitude ne règne pas dans la maison[126]...»
U||L'œuvre porte un peu la trace de cette expérience attristée, de ces passions désabusées[127]. Sauf dans les jolis chapitres des fiançailles de Levine, l'amour n'a plus la jeune poésie qui égale certaines pages de Guerre et Paix aux plus belles poésies lyriques de tous les temps. En revanche, il a pris un caractère âpre, sensuel, impérieux. La fatalité qui règne sur le roman n'est plus, comme dans Guerre et Paix, une sorte de dieu Krichna, meurtrier et serein, le Destin des Empires, mais la folie d'aimer, «la Vénus tout entière...» C'est elle qui, dans la scène merveilleuse du bal, où la passion s'empare, à leur insu, d'Anna et de Wronski, prête à la beauté innocente d'Anna, couronnée de pensées et vêtue de velours noir, «une séduction presque infernale»[128]. C'est elle qui, lorsque Wronski vient de se déclarer, fait rayonner le visage d'Anna,—«non de joie: c'était le rayonnement terrible d'un incendie, par une nuit obscure[129]». C'est elle qui, dans les veines de cette f
U||emme loyale et raisonnable, de cette jeune mère aimante, fait couler une force voluptueuse de sève et s'installe dans son cœur, qu'elle ne quittera plus qu'après l'avoir détruit. Aucun de ceux qui approchent Anna n'est sans subir l'attirance et l'effroi du démon caché. La première, Kitty, le découvre, avec saisissement. Une crainte mystérieuse se mêle à la joie de Wronski, quand il va voir Anna. Levine, en sa présence, perd toute sa volonté. Anna elle-même sait bien qu'elle ne s'appartient plus. A mesure que l'histoire se déroule, l'implacable passion ronge, pièce par pièce, tout l'édifice moral de la fière personne. Tout ce qu'il y a de meilleur en elle, son âme brave et sincère, s'effrite et tombe: elle n'a plus la force de sacrifier sa vanité mondaine; sa vie n'a plus d'autre objet que de plaire à son amant; elle s'interdit peureusement, honteusement, d'avoir des enfants; la jalousie, la torture; la force sensuelle qui l'asservit l'oblige à mentir dans ses gestes, dans sa voix, da
U||ns ses yeux; elle tombe au rang des femmes qui ne cherchent plus qu'à tourner la tête à tout homme, quel qu'il soit; elle a recours à la morphine pour s'abrutir, jusqu'au jour où les tourments intolérables qui la dévorent la jettent, avec l'amer sentiment de sa déchéance morale, sous les roues d'un wagon. «Et le petit moujik à barbe ébouriffée»,—la vision sinistre qui a hanté ses rêves et ceux de Wronski,—«se penche du marchepied du wagon sur la voie»; et, disait le rêve prophétique, «il était courbé en deux sur un sac, et il y enfouissait les restes de quelque chose, qui avait été la vie, avec ses tourments, ses trahisons et ses douleurs...»
U||«Je me suis réservé la vengeance[130]», dit le Seigneur....
U||Autour de cette tragédie d'une âme que l'amour consume et qu'écrase la Loi de Dieu,—peinture d'une seule coulée et d'une profondeur effrayante,—Tolstoï a disposé, comme dans Guerre et Paix, les romans d'autres vies. Malheureusement ici, ces histoires parallèles alternent d'une façon un peu raide et factice, sans atteindre à l'unité organique de la symphonie de Guerre et Paix. On peut aussi trouver que le parfait réalisme de certains tableaux—les cercles aristocratiques de Pétersbourg et leurs oisifs entretiens,—touche parfois à l'inutilité. Enfin, plus ouvertement encore que dans Guerre et Paix, Tolstoï a juxtaposé sa personnalité morale et ses idées philosophiques au spectacle de la vie. Mais l'œuvre n'en est pas moins d'une richesse merveilleuse. Même profusion de types que dans Guerre et Paix, et tous d'une justesse frappante. Les portraits d'hommes me semblent même supérieurs. Tolstoï s'est complu à peindre Stepane Arcadievitch, l'aimable égoïste, que nul ne peut voir sa
U||ns répondre à son affectueux sourire, et Karénine, le type parfait du grand fonctionnaire, l'homme d'État distingué et médiocre, avec sa manie de cacher ses sentiments vrais sous une ironie perpétuelle: mélange de dignité et de lâcheté, de pharisianisme et de sentiment chrétien; produit étrange d'un monde artificiel, dont il lui est impossible malgré son intelligence et sa générosité réelle de se dégager jamais,—et qui a bien raison de se défier de son cœur: car, lorsqu'il s'y abandonne, c'est pour tomber à la fin dans une niaiserie mystique.
U||Mais l'intérêt principal du roman, avec la tragédie d'Anna et les tableaux variés de la société russe vers 1860,—salons, cercles d'officiers, bals, théâtres, courses,—est dans son caractère autobiographique. Beaucoup plus qu'aucun autre personnage de Tolstoï, Constantin Levine est son incarnation. Non seulement Tolstoï lui a prêté ses idées à la fois conservatrices et démocratiques, son anti-libéralisme d'aristocrate paysan qui méprise les intellectuels[131]; mais il lui a prêté sa vie. L'amour de Levine et de Kitty et leurs premières années de mariage sont une transposition de ses propres souvenirs domestiques,—de même que la mort du frère de Levine est une douloureuse évocation de la mort du frère de Tolstoï, Dmitri. Toute la dernière partie, inutile au roman, nous fait lire dans les troubles qui l'agitaient alors. Si l'épilogue de Guerre et Paix était une transition artistique à une autre œuvre projetée, l'épilogue d'Anna Karénine est une transition autobiographiqu
U||e à la révolution morale, qui devait, deux ans plus tard, s'exprimer par les Confessions. Déjà, au cours du livre, revient perpétuellement, sous une forme ironique ou violente, la critique de la société contemporaine, qu'il ne cessera de combattre dans ses œuvres futures. Guerre au mensonge, à tous les mensonges, aussi bien aux mensonges vertueux qu'aux mensonges vicieux, aux bavardages libéraux, à la charité mondaine, à la religion de salon, à la philanthropie! Guerre au monde, qui fausse tous les sentiments vrais et fatalement brise les élans généreux de l'âme! La mort jette une lumière subite sur les conventions sociales. Devant Anna mourante, le guindé Karénine s'attendrit. Dans cette âme sans vie, où tout est fabriqué, pénètre un rayon d'amour et de pardon chrétien. Tous trois, le mari, la femme et l'amant, sont momentanément transformés. Tout devient simple et loyal. Mais à mesure qu'Anna se rétablit, ils sentent, tous les trois, «en face de la force morale, presque sain
U||te qui les guidait intérieurement, l'existence d'une autre force, brutale, mais toute-puissante, qui dirige leur vie malgré eux, et ne leur accordera pas la paix.» Et ils savent d'avance qu'ils seront impuissants dans cette lutte, où «ils seront obligés de faire le mal, que le monde jugera nécessaire[132]».
U||Si Levine, comme Tolstoï qu'il incarne, s'épure lui aussi, dans l'épilogue du livre, c'est que la mort l'a, lui aussi, touché. Jusque-là, «incapable de croire, il l'était également de douter tout à fait[133]». Depuis qu'il a vu mourir son frère, la terreur de son ignorance le tient. Son mariage a, pour un temps, étouffé ces angoisses. Mais, dès la naissance de son premier enfant, elles reparaissent. Il passe alternativement par des crises de prière et de négation. Il lit en vain les philosophes. Dans son affolement, il en vient à redouter la tentation du suicide. Le travail physique le soulage: ici, point de doutes, tout est clair. Levine cause avec les paysans; un d'eux lui parle des hommes «qui vivent non pour soi, mais pour Dieu». Ce lui est une illumination. Il voit l'antagonisme entre la raison et le cœur. La raison enseigne la lutte féroce pour la vie; il n'y a rien de raisonnable à aimer son prochain:
U||La raison ne m'a rien appris; tout ce que je sais m'a été donné, révélé par le cœur[134].
U||Dès lors, le calme revient. Le mot de l'humble moujik, dont le cœur est le seul guide, l'a ramené à Dieu... Quel Dieu? Il ne cherche pas à le savoir. Levine, à ce moment, comme Tolstoï le restera longtemps, est humble à l'égard de l'Église, et nullement en révolte contre les dogmes.
U||Il y a une vérité, même dans l'illusion de la voûte céleste et dans les mouvements apparents des astres[135].
U||Ces angoisses de Levine, ces velléités de suicide qu'il cachait à Kitty, Tolstoï au même moment les cachait à sa femme. Mais il n'avait pas encore atteint le calme qu'il prêtait à son héros. A vrai dire, ce calme n'est guère communicatif. On sent qu'il est désiré plus que réalisé, et que tout à l'heure Levine retombera dans ses doutes. Tolstoï n'en était pas dupe. Il avait eu bien de la peine à aller jusqu'au bout de son œuvre. Anna Karénine l'ennuyait, avant qu'il eût fini[136]. Il ne pouvait plus travailler. Il restait là, inerte, sans volonté, en proie au dégoût et à la terreur de lui-même. Alors, dans le vide de sa vie, se leva le grand vent qui sortait de l'abîme, le vertige de la mort. Tolstoï a raconté ces terribles années, plus tard, quand il venait d'échapper au gouffre[137].
U||«Je n'avais pas cinquante ans, dit-il[138], j'aimais, j'étais aimé, j'avais de bons enfants, un grand domaine, la gloire, la santé, la vigueur physique et morale; j'étais capable de faucher comme un paysan; je travaillais dix heures de suite sans fatigue. Brusquement, ma vie s'arrêta. Je pouvais respirer, manger, boire, dormir. Mais ce n'était pas vivre. Je n'avais plus de désirs. Je savais qu'il n'y avait rien à désirer. Je ne pouvais même pas souhaiter de connaître la vérité. La vérité était que la vie est une insanité. J'étais arrivé à l'abîme et je voyais nettement que devant moi il n'y avait rien, que la mort. Moi, homme bien portant et heureux, je sentais que je ne pouvais plus vivre. Une force invincible m'entraînait à me débarrasser de la vie... Je ne dirai pas que je voulais me tuer. La force qui me poussait hors de la vie était plus puissante que moi; c'était une aspiration semblable à mon ancienne aspiration à la vie, seulement en sens inverse. Je devais user de ruse e
U||nvers moi-même pour ne pas y céder trop vite. Et voilà que moi, l'homme heureux, je me cachais à moi-même la corde, pour ne pas me pendre à la poutre, entre les armoires de ma chambre, où chaque soir je restais seul à me déshabiller. Je n'allais plus à la chasse avec mon fusil, pour ne pas me laisser tenter[139]. Il me semblait que ma vie était une farce stupide, qui m'était jouée par quelqu'un. Quarante ans de travail, de peines, de progrès, pour voir qu'il n'y a rien! Rien. De moi, il ne restera que la pourriture et les vers... On peut vivre, seulement pendant qu'on est ivre de la vie; mais aussitôt l'ivresse dissipée, on voit que tout n'est que supercherie, supercherie stupide... La famille et l'art ne pouvaient plus me suffire. La famille, c'étaient des malheureux comme moi. L'art est un miroir de la vie. Quand la vie n'a plus de sens, le jeu du miroir ne peut plus amuser. Et le pire, je ne pouvais me résigner. J'étais semblable à un homme égaré dans une forêt, qui est saisi d'horr
U||eur, parce qu'il s'est égaré, et qui court de tous côtés et ne peut s'arrêter, bien qu'il sache qu'à chaque pas il s'égare davantage...»
U||Le salut vint du peuple. Tolstoï avait toujours eu pour lui «une affection étrange, toute physique[140]», que n'avaient pu ébranler les expériences répétées de ses désillusions sociales. Dans les dernières années, il s'était, comme Levine, beaucoup rapproché de lui[141]. Il se prit à penser à ces milliards d'êtres en dehors du cercle étroit des savants, des riches et des oisifs qui se tuaient, s'étourdissaient, ou traînaient lâchement, comme lui, une vie désespérée. Et il se demanda pourquoi ces milliards d'êtres échappaient à ce désespoir, pourquoi ils ne se tuaient pas. Il aperçut alors qu'ils vivaient, non par le secours de la raison, mais sans se soucier d'elle,—par la foi. Qu'était-ce que cette foi, qui ignorait la raison?
U||La foi est la force de la vie. On ne peut pas vivre sans la foi. Les idées religieuses ont été élaborées dans le lointain infini de la pensée humaine. Les réponses données par la foi au sphinx de la vie contiennent la sagesse la plus profonde de l'humanité.
U||Suffit-il donc de connaître ces formules de la sagesse, qu'a enregistrées le livre des religions?—Non, la foi n'est pas une science, la foi est une action; elle n'a de sens que si elle est vécue. Le dégoût qu'inspira à Tolstoï la vue des gens riches et bien pensants, pour qui la foi n'était qu'une sorte de «consolation épicurienne de la vie», le rejeta décidément parmi les hommes simples, qui mettaient seuls d'accord leur vie avec leur foi.
U||Et il comprit que la vie du peuple travailleur était la vie elle-même et que le sens attribué à cette vie était la vérité.
U||Mais comment se faire peuple, et partager sa foi? On a beau savoir que les autres ont raison; il ne dépend pas de nous que nous soyons comme eux. En vain, nous prions Dieu; en vain, nous tendons vers lui nos bras avides. Dieu fuit. Où le saisir?
U||Un jour, la grâce vint.
U||Un jour de printemps précoce, j'étais seul dans la forêt et j'écoutais ses bruits. Je pensais à mes agitations des trois dernières années, à ma recherche de Dieu, à mes sautes perpétuelles de la joie au désespoir... Et brusquement je vis que je ne vivais que lorsque je croyais en Dieu. A sa seule pensée, les ondes joyeuses de la vie se soulevaient en moi. Tout s'animait autour, tout recevait un sens. Mais dès que je n'y croyais plus, soudain la vie cessait.
U||—Alors, qu'est-ce que je cherche encore? cria en moi une voix. C'est donc Lui, ce sans quoi on ne peut vivre! Connaître Dieu et vivre, c'est la même chose. Dieu, c'est la vie....
U||Depuis, cette lumière ne m'a plus quitté[142].
U||Il était sauvé. Dieu lui était apparu[143].
U||Mais comme il n'était pas un mystique de l'Inde, à qui l'extase suffit, comme en lui se mêlaient aux rêves de l'Asiatique la manie de raison et le besoin d'action de l'homme d'Occident, il lui fallait ensuite traduire sa révélation en foi pratique et dégager de cette vie divine des règles pour la vie quotidienne. Sans aucun parti-pris, avec le désir sincère de croire aux croyances des siens, il commença par étudier la doctrine de l'Église orthodoxe, dont il faisait partie[144]. Afin d'en être plus près, il se soumit pendant trois ans à toutes les cérémonies, se confessant, communiant, n'osant juger ce qui le choquait, s'inventant des explications pour ce qu'il trouvait obscur ou incompréhensible, s'unissant dans leur foi à tous ceux qu'il aimait, vivants ou morts, et toujours gardant l'espoir qu'à un certain moment «l'amour lui ouvrirait les portes de la vérité».—Mais il avait beau faire: sa raison et son cœur se révoltaient. Tels actes, comme le baptême et la communion, lui sem
U||blaient scandaleux. Quand on le força à répéter que l'hostie était le vrai corps et le vrai sang du Christ, «il en eut comme un coup de couteau au cœur». Ce ne furent pourtant pas les dogmes qui élevèrent entre lui et l'Église un mur infranchissable, mais les questions pratiques,—deux surtout: l'intolérance haineuse et mutuelle des Églises[145], et la sanction, formelle ou tacite, donnée à l'homicide,—la guerre et la peine de mort.
U||Alors Tolstoï brisa net; et sa rupture fut d'autant plus violente que depuis trois années il comprimait sa pensée. Il ne ménagea plus rien. Avec emportement, il foula aux pieds cette religion, que la veille encore il s'obstinait à pratiquer. Dans sa Critique de la théologie dogmatique (1879-1881), il la traita non seulement «d'insanité, mais de mensonge conscient et intéressé[146]». Il lui opposa l'Évangile, dans sa Concordance et Traduction des quatre Évangiles (1881-1883). Enfin, sur l'Évangile, il édifia sa foi (En quoi consiste ma foi, 1883).
U||Elle tient toute en ces mots:
U||Je crois en la doctrine du Christ. Je crois que le bonheur n'est possible sur la terre que quand tous les hommes l'accompliront.
U||Et elle a pour pierre angulaire le Sermon sur la Montagne, dont Tolstoï ramène l'enseignement essentiel à cinq commandements:
U||I.	Ne te mets pas en colère.
U||II.	Ne commets pas l'adultère.
U||III.	Ne prête pas serment.
U||IV.	Ne résiste pas au mal par le mal.
U||V.	Ne sois l'ennemi de personne.
U||C'est la partie négative de la doctrine, dont la partie positive se résume en ce seul commandement:
U||Aime Dieu et ton prochain comme toi-même.
U||Le Christ a dit que celui qui aura violé le moindre de ces commandements tiendra la plus petite place dans le royaume des cieux.
U||Et Tolstoï ajoute naïvement:
U||Si étrange que cela paraisse, j'ai dû, après dix-huit siècles, découvrir ces règles comme une nouveauté.
U||Tolstoï croit-il donc à la divinité du Christ?—En aucune façon. A quel titre l'invoque-t-il? Comme le plus grand de la lignée des sages,—Brahmanes, Bouddha, Lao-Tse, Confucius, Zoroastre, Isaïe,—qui ont montré aux hommes le vrai bonheur auquel ils aspirent et la voie qu'il faut suivre[147]. Tolstoï est le disciple de ces grands créateurs religieux, de ces demi-dieux et de ces prophètes hindous, chinois et hébraïques. Il les défend—comme il sait défendre: en attaquant—contre ceux qu'il nomme «les Pharisiens» et «les Scribes»: contre les Églises établies et contre les représentants de la science orgueilleuse, ou plutôt «du philosophisme scientifique[148]». Ce n'est pas qu'il fasse appel à la révélation contre la raison. Depuis qu'il est sorti de la période de troubles que racontent les Confessions, il est et reste essentiellement un croyant en la Raison, on pourrait dire un mystique de la Raison.
U||«Au commencement était le Verbe, répète-t-il avec saint Jean, le Verbe, Logos, c'est-à-dire la Raison[149].»
U||Son livre De la Vie (1887) porte, en épigraphe, les lignes fameuses de Pascal[150]:
U||L'homme n'est qu'un roseau, le plus faible de la nature, mais c'est un roseau pensant.... Toute notre dignité consiste dans la pensée... Travaillons donc à bien penser: voilà le principe de la morale.
U||Et le livre entier n'est qu'un hymne à la Raison.
U||Il est vrai que sa Raison n'est pas la raison scientifique, raison restreinte, «qui prend la partie pour le tout et la vie animale pour la vie tout entière», mais la loi souveraine qui régit la vie de l'homme, «la loi suivant laquelle doivent forcément vivre les êtres raisonnables, c'est-à-dire les hommes».
U||C'est une loi analogue à celles qui régissent la nutrition et la reproduction de l'animal, la croissance et la floraison de l'herbe et de l'arbre, le mouvement de la terre et des astres. Ce n'est que dans l'accomplissement de cette loi, dans la soumission de notre nature animale à la loi de la raison, en vue d'acquérir le bien, que consiste notre vie... La raison ne peut être définie, et nous n'avons pas besoin de la définir, car non seulement nous la connaissons tous, mais nous ne connaissons qu'elle... Tout ce que l'homme sait, il le connaît au moyen de la raison et non pas de la foi[151]... La vraie vie ne commence qu'au moment où se manifeste la raison. La seule vie véritable est la vie de la raison.
U||Qu'est-ce donc que l'existence visible, notre vie individuelle? «Elle n'est pas notre vie», dit Tolstoï, car elle ne dépend pas de nous.
U||Notre activité animale s'accomplit en dehors de nous... L'humanité en a fini avec l'idée de la vie considérée comme existence individuelle. La négation de la possibilité du bien individuel reste une vérité inébranlable pour tout homme de notre époque, qui est doué de raison[152].
U||Il y a là toute une série de postulats, que je n'ai pas à discuter ici, mais qui montrent avec quelle passion la raison s'était emparée de Tolstoï. En vérité, elle était une passion, non moins aveugle et jalouse que les autres passions qui l'avaient possédé pendant la première moitié de sa vie. Un feu s'éteint, l'autre s'allume. Ou plutôt, c'est toujours le même feu. Mais il change d'aliments.
U||Et ce qui ajoute à la ressemblance entre les passions «individuelles» et cette passion «rationnelle», c'est que l'une comme les autres ne se satisfont pas d'aimer, elles veulent agir, elles veulent se réaliser.
U||Il ne faut pas parler, mais agir, a dit le Christ.
U||Et quelle est l'activité de la raison?—L'amour.
U||L'amour est la seule activité raisonnable de l'homme, l'amour est l'état de l'âme le plus rationnel et le plus lumineux. Tout ce dont il a besoin, c'est que rien ne lui cache le soleil de la raison, qui seul le fait croître... L'amour est le bien réel, le bien suprême, qui résout toutes les contradictions de la vie, qui non seulement fait disparaître l'épouvante de la mort, mais pousse l'homme à se sacrifier aux autres; car il n'y a pas d'autre amour que celui qui donne sa vie pour ceux qu'on aime; l'amour n'est digne de ce nom que lorsqu'il est un sacrifice de soi-même. Aussi le véritable amour n'est-il réalisable que lorsque l'homme comprend qu'il lui est impossible d'acquérir le bonheur individuel. C'est alors que tous les sucis de sa vie viennent alimenter la noble greffe de l'amour véritable; et cette greffe emprunte pour sa croissance toute sa vigueur au tronc de cet arbre sauvage, l'individualité animale...[153].
U||Ainsi, Tolstoï n'arrive pas à la foi, comme un fleuve épuisé, qui se perd dans les sables. Il y apporte le torrent de forces impétueuses amassées durant une puissante vie.—On allait s'en apercevoir.
U||Cette foi passionnée, où s'unissent en une ardente étreinte la Raison et l'Amour, a trouvé son expression la plus auguste dans la célèbre réponse au Saint-Synode qui l'excommuniait[154]:
U||Je crois en Dieu, qui est pour moi l'Esprit, l'Amour, le Principe de tout. Je crois qu'il est en moi, comme je suis en lui. Je crois que la volonté de Dieu n'a jamais été plus clairement exprimée que dans la doctrine de l'homme Christ; mais on ne peut considérer Christ comme Dieu et lui adresser des prières, sans commettre le plus grand des sacrilèges. Je crois que le vrai bonheur de l'homme consiste en l'accomplissement de la volonté de Dieu; je crois que la volonté de Dieu est que tout homme aime ses semblables et agisse toujours envers eux, comme il voudrait qu'ils agissent envers lui, ce qui résume, dit l'Évangile, toute la loi et les prophètes. Je crois que le sens de la vie, pour chacun de nous, est seulement d'accroître l'amour en lui, je crois que ce développement de notre puissance d'aimer nous vaudra, dans cette vie, un bonheur qui grandira chaque jour, et dans l'autre monde, une félicité plus parfaite; je crois que cet accroissement de l'amour contribuera, plus que toute autre forc
U||e, à fonder sur terre le royaume de Dieu, c'est-à-dire à remplacer une organisation de la vie où la division, le mensonge et la violence sont tout-puissants; par un ordre nouveau où régneront la concorde, la vérité et la fraternité. Je crois que pour progresser dans l'amour, nous n'avons qu'un moyen: les prières. Non la prière publique dans les temples, que le Christ a formellement réprouvée (Matth., VI, 5-13). Mais la prière dont lui-même nous a donné l'exemple, la prière solitaire qui raffermit en nous la conscience du sens de notre vie et le sentiment que nous dépendons seulement de la volonté de Dieu... Je crois à la vie éternelle, je crois que l'homme est récompensé selon ses actes, ici et partout, maintenant et toujours. Je crois tout cela si fermement qu'à mon âge, sur le bord de la tombe, je dois souvent faire un effort pour ne pas appeler de mes vœux la mort de mon corps, c'est-à-dire ma naissance à une vie nouvelle...[155].
U||Il pensait être arrivé au port, avoir atteint le refuge où son âme inquiète pourrait se reposer. Il n'était qu'au début d'une activité nouvelle.
U||Un hiver passé à Moscou (ses devoirs de famille l'avaient obligé à y suivre les siens)[156], le recensement de la population, auquel il obtint de prendre part, en janvier 1882, lui furent une occasion de voir de près la misère des grandes villes. L'impression produite sur lui fut effroyable. Le soir du jour où il avait pris contact, pour la première fois, avec cette plaie cachée de la civilisation, racontant à un ami ce qu'il avait vu, «il se mit à crier, pleurer, brandir le poing».
U||«On ne peut pas vivre ainsi!» disait-il avec des sanglots, «Cela ne peut pas être! Cela ne peut pas être[157]!...» Il retomba, pour des mois, dans un désespoir affreux. La comtesse Tolstoï lui écrivait, le 3 mars 1882:
U||Tu disais naguère: «A cause du manque de foi, je voulais me pendre». Maintenant, tu as la foi, pourquoi donc es-tu malheureux?
U||Parce qu'il n'avait pas la foi du pharisien, la foi béate et satisfaite de soi, parce qu'il n'avait pas l'égoïsme du penseur mystique, trop occupé de son salut pour songer à celui des autres[158], parce qu'il avait l'amour, parce qu'il ne pouvait plus oublier maintenant les misérables qu'il avait vus, et que dans la bonté passionnée de son cœur, il lui semblait être responsable de leurs souffrances et de leur abjection: ils étaient les victimes de cette civilisation, aux privilèges de laquelle il participait, de cette idole monstrueuse à laquelle une caste élue sacrifiait des millions d'hommes. Accepter le bénéfice de tels crimes, c'était s'y associer. Sa conscience n'eut plus de repos qu'il ne les eût dénoncés.
U||Que devons-nous faire? (1884-86)[159] est l'expression de cette deuxième crise, beaucoup plus tragique que la première, et bien plus grosse en conséquences. Qu'étaient les angoisses religieuses personnelles de Tolstoï dans cet océan de misère humaine, de misère réelle, non forgée par l'esprit d'un oisif qui s'ennuie? Impossible de ne pas la voir. Et impossible, l'ayant vue, de ne pas chercher à la supprimer, à tout prix.—Hélas! est-ce possible?...
U||Un admirable portrait, que je ne puis regarder sans émotion[160], dit ce que Tolstoï souffrit alors. Il est représenté de face, assis, les bras croisés, en blouse de moujik; il a l'air accablé. Ses cheveux sont encore noirs, sa moustache déjà grise, sa grande barbe et ses favoris tout blancs. Une double ride laboure dans le beau front large un sillon harmonieux. Il y a tant de bonté dans le gros nez de bon chien, dans les yeux qui vous regardent, si francs, si clairs, si tristes! Ils lisent si sûrement en vous! Ils vous plaignent et vous implorent. La figure est creusée, porte les traces de la souffrance, de grands plis au-dessous des yeux. Il a pleuré. Mais il est fort et prêt au combat.
U||Il avait une logique héroïque.
U||Je m'étonne toujours de ces paroles si souvent répétées: «Oui, c'est bien en théorie; mais comment sera-ce en pratique?» Comme si la théorie consistait en de belles paroles nécessaires pour la conversation, mais pas du tout pour y conformer la pratique!... Quand j'ai compris une chose à laquelle j'ai réfléchi, alors je ne puis la faire autrement que je l'ai comprise[161].
U||Il commence par décrire, avec une exactitude photographique, la misère à Moscou, telle qu'il l'a vue, au cours de ses visites aux quartiers pauvres, ou aux asiles de nuit[162]. Il se convainc que ce n'est pas avec de l'argent, comme il l'avait cru d'abord, qu'il pourra sauver ces malheureux, tous plus ou moins atteints par la corruption des villes. Alors, il cherche bravement d'où vient le mal. Et d'anneau en anneau se déroule la chaîne effrayante des responsabilités. Les riches d'abord, et la contagion de leur luxe maudit, qui attire et déprave[163]. La séduction universelle de la vie sans travail.—L'État ensuite, cette entité meurtrière, créée par les violents pour dépouiller et asservir, à leur profit, le reste de l'humanité.—L'Église, associée; la science et l'art, complices... Comment combattre toutes ces armées du mal? D'abord, en refusant de s'y enrôler. En refusant de participer à l'exploitation humaine. En renonçant à l'argent et à la possession de la terre[164], en ne s
U||ervant point l'État.
U||Mais ce n'est pas assez, il faut «ne pas mentir», ne pas avoir peur de la vérité. Il faut «se repentir», et arracher l'orgueil, enraciné avec l'instruction. Il faut enfin travailler de ses mains. «Tu gagneras ton pain à la sueur de ton front»: c'est le premier commandement et le plus essentiel[165]. Et Tolstoï, répondant par avance aux railleries de l'élite, dit que le travail physique n'entrave en rien l'énergie intellectuelle, mais qu'il l'accroît au contraire et qu'il répond aux exigences normales de la nature. La santé ne peut qu'y gagner; l'art, davantage encore. De plus, il rétablit l'union entre les hommes.
U||Dans ses ouvrages suivants, Tolstoï complétera ces préceptes d'hygiène morale. Il s'inquiétera d'achever la cure de l'âme, d'en refaire l'énergie, en proscrivant les plaisirs vicieux, qui endorment la conscience[166], et les plaisirs cruels, qui la tuent[167]. Il donne l'exemple. En 1884, il a fait le sacrifice de sa passion la plus enracinée: la chasse[168]. Il pratique l'abstinence, qui forge la volonté. Tel, un athlète qui s'impose une dure discipline, pour combattre et pour vaincre.
U||Que devons-nous faire? marque la première étape de la route difficile où Tolstoï allait s'engager, quittant la paix relative de la méditation religieuse pour la mêlée sociale. Et dès lors commença cette guerre de vingt ans, qu'au nom de l'Évangile le vieux prophète d'Iasnaïa Poliana livra, seul, en dehors de tous les partis, et les condamnant tous, aux crimes et aux mensonges de la civilisation.
U||Autour de lui, la révolution morale de Tolstoï rencontrait peu de sympathie; elle désolait sa famille.
U||Depuis longtemps déjà, la comtesse Tolstoï observait, inquiète, les progrès d'un mal qu'elle combattait en vain. Dès 1874, elle s'indignait de voir son mari perdre tant de forces et de temps à des travaux pour les écoles.
U||Ce Syllabaire, cette arithmétique, cette grammaire, je les méprise et ne puis faire semblant de m'y intéresser.
U||Ce fut bien autre chose quand à la pédagogie succéda la religion. Si hostile fut l'accueil fait par la comtesse aux premières confidences du nouveau converti que Tolstoï éprouve le besoin de s'excuser, quand il parle de Dieu dans ses lettres:
U||Ne te fâche pas, comme tu le fais parfois, quand je mentionne Dieu; je ne puis l'éviter, car il est la base même de ma pensée[169].
U||La comtesse est touchée, sans doute; elle tâche de dissimuler son impatience; mais elle ne comprend pas; elle observe son mari avec inquiétude:
U||Ses yeux sont étranges, fixes. Il ne parle presque pas. Il semble n'être pas de ce monde[170].
U||Elle pense qu'il est malade:
U||Léon travaille toujours, à ce qu'il dit. Hélas! il écrit des discussions religieuses quelconques. Il lit et réfléchit, jusqu'à se donner mal à la tête, et tout cela pour montrer que l'Église n'est pas d'accord avec la doctrine de l'Évangile. C'est à peine s'il se trouve en Russie une dizaine de personnes que cela puisse intéresser. Mais il n'y a rien à faire. Je ne souhaite qu'une chose: qu'il en finisse au plus vite, et que cela passe comme une maladie[171].
U||La maladie ne passa point. La situation devint de plus en plus pénible entre les deux époux. Ils s'aimaient, ils avaient l'un pour l'autre une estime profonde; mais il leur était impossible de se comprendre. Ils tâchaient de se faire des concessions mutuelles, qui devenaient—comme c'est l'habitude—de mutuels tourments. Tolstoï s'obligeait à suivre les siens, à Moscou. Il écrivait dans son Journal:
U||Le mois le plus pénible de ma vie. L'installation à Moscou. Tous s'installent. Quand donc commenceront-ils à vivre? Tout cela, non pour vivre, mais parce que les autres gens font ainsi! Les malheureux[172]!...
U||Dans ces mêmes jours, la comtesse écrivait:
U||Moscou. Il y aura demain un mois que nous sommes ici. Les deux premières semaines, j'ai pleuré chaque jour, parce que Léon était non seulement triste, mais tout à fait abattu. Il ne dormait pas, il ne mangeait pas, et même parfois, il pleurait; j'ai cru que je deviendrais folle[173].
U||Ils durent s'éloigner l'un de l'autre, pendant quelque temps. Ils se demandent pardon de se faire souffrir. Comme ils s'aiment toujours!... Il lui écrit:
U||Tu dis: «Je t'aime et tu n'en as pas besoin». C'est la seule chose dont j'aie besoin... Ton amour me réjouit plus que tout au monde[174].
U||Mais, dès qu'ils se retrouvent ensemble, le désaccord s'accuse. La comtesse ne peut prendre son parti de cette manie religieuse, qui pousse maintenant Tolstoï à apprendre l'hébreu avec un rabbin.
U||Rien autre ne l'intéresse plus. Il dépense ses forces à des sottises. Je ne puis cacher mon mécontentement[175].
U||Elle lui écrit:
U||Je ne puis que m'attrister que de pareilles forces intellectuelles se dépensent à couper du bois, chauffer le samovar, et coudre des bottes.
U||Et elle ajoute, avec le sourire affectueux et moqueur d'une mère qui regarde jouer son enfant, un peu fou:
U||Enfin, je me suis calmée avec le proverbe russe: «Que l'enfant s'amuse de n'importe quoi, pourvu qu'il ne pleure pas[176]!»
U||Mais la lettre n'est pas partie qu'elle voit en pensée son mari lisant ces lignes, de ses bons yeux candides, qu'attriste ce ton d'ironie; et elle rouvre la lettre, dans un élan d'amour:
U||Tout d'un coup, tu t'es représenté si clairement à moi, et j'ai senti un tel accès de tendresse pour toi! Il y a en toi quelque chose de si sage, de si bon, de si naïf, de si persévérant, tout cela éclairé par une lumière de compassion pour tous, et ce regard qui va droit à l'âme... Et cela n'appartient qu'à toi seul.
U||Ainsi, ces deux êtres qui s'aimaient, se torturaient l'un l'autre et se désolaient ensuite du mal qu'ils avaient pu faire, sans pouvoir l'empêcher. Situation sans issue, qui dura près de trente ans, et à laquelle, seule, devait mettre fin, dans une heure d'égarement, la fuite du vieux roi Lear, mourant, à travers la steppe.
U||On n'a pas assez remarqué l'appel émouvant aux femmes, qui termine Que devons-nous faire?—Tolstoï n'a aucune sympathie pour le féminisme moderne[177]. Mais pour celle qu'il nomme «la femme-mère», pour celle qui connaît le vrai sens de la vie, il a des paroles d'adoration pieuse; il fait un magnifique éloge de ses peines et de ses joies, de la grossesse et de la maternité, de ces souffrances terribles, de ces années sans repos, de ce travail invisible, épuisant, dont la femme n'attend la récompense de personne, et de cette béatitude qui inonde l'âme, au sortir de la douleur, quand elle a accompli la Loi. Il trace le portrait de l'épouse vaillante, qui est pour son mari une aide, non un obstacle. Elle sait que, «seul le sacrifice obscur, sans récompense, pour la vie des autres, est la vocation de l'homme».
U||Une telle femme non seulement n'encouragera pas son mari à un travail faux et trompeur, qui n'a pour but que de jouir du travail des autres; mais avec horreur et dégoût, elle envisagera cette activité qui serait une séduction pour ses enfants. Elle exigera de son compagnon le vrai travail, qui veut de l'énergie et ne craint pas le danger... Elle sait que les enfants, les générations à venir, sont ce qu'il est donné aux hommes de voir de plus saint, et qu'elle vit pour servir, de tout son être, cette œuvre sacrée. Elle développera dans ses enfants et dans son mari la force du sacrifice... Ce sont de telles femmes, qui dominent les hommes et leur servent d'étoile conductrice... O femmes-mères! Entre vos mains est le salut du monde[178]!
U||C'est l'appel d'une voix qui supplie, qui espère encore... Ne sera-t-elle pas entendue?...
U||Quelques années plus tard, la dernière lueur d'espoir est éteinte:
U||Vous ne le croirez peut-être pas; mais vous ne sauriez imaginer combien je suis isolé, jusqu'à quel point mon moi véritable est méprisé par tous ceux qui m'entourent[179].
U||Si les plus aimants méconnaissaient ainsi la grandeur de sa transformation morale, on ne pouvait attendre des autres ni plus de pénétration, ni plus de respect. Tourgueniev, avec qui Tolstoï avait tenu à se réconcilier, plutôt dans un esprit d'humilité chrétienne que parce qu'il avait changé de sentiments à son égard[180], disait ironiquement: «Je plains beaucoup Tolstoï; mais d'ailleurs, comme disent les Français, chacun tue ses puces, à sa manière[181]».
U||Quelques années plus tard, sur le point de mourir, il écrivait à Tolstoï la lettre connue, où il suppliait son «ami, le grand écrivain de la terre russe», de «retourner à la littérature[182]».
U||Tous les artistes européens s'associaient à l'inquiétude et à la prière de Tourgueniev, mourant. Eugène-Melchior de Vogüé, à la fin de l'étude qu'en 1886 il consacrait à Tolstoï, prenait prétexte d'un portrait de l'écrivain en costume de moujik, tirant l'alène, pour lui adresser une éloquente apostrophe:
U||Artisan de chefs-d'œuvre, ce n'est pas là votre outil!... Notre outil, c'est la plume; notre champ, l'âme humaine, qu'il faut abriter et nourrir, elle aussi. Permettez qu'on vous rappelle ce cri d'un paysan russe, du premier imprimeur de Moscou, alors qu'on le remettait à la charrue: «Je n'ai pas affaire de semer le grain de blé, mais de répandre dans le monde les semences spirituelles».
U||Comme si Tolstoï avait jamais songé à renier son rôle de semeur du blé de la pensée!... A la fin de: En quoi consiste ma foi[183], il écrivait:
U||Je crois que ma vie, ma raison, ma lumière, m'est donnée exclusivement pour éclairer les hommes. Je crois que ma connaissance de la vérité est un talent qui m'est prêté pour cet objet, que ce talent est un feu, qui n'est feu que quand il brûle. Je crois que l'unique sens de ma vie, c'est de vivre dans cette lumière qui est en moi, et de la tenir haut devant les hommes pour qu'ils la voient[184].
U||Mais cette lumière, ce feu «qui n'est feu que quand il brûle», inquiétaient la plupart des artistes. Les plus intelligents n'étaient pas sans prévoir que leur art risquait fort d'être la première proie de l'incendie. Ils affectaient de croire que l'art tout entier était menacé et que, comme Prospero, Tolstoï brisait pour jamais sa baguette magique d'illusions créatrices.
U||Or, rien n'était moins vrai; et j'entends démontrer que, loin de ruiner l'art, Tolstoï a suscité en lui des énergies qui restaient en jachère, et que sa foi religieuse, au lieu de tuer son génie artistique, l'a renouvelé.
U||Il est singulier que, lorsqu'on parle des idées de Tolstoï sur la science et sur l'art, on laisse généralement de côté le plus important des livres où ces idées sont exprimées: Que devons-nous faire? (1884-1886). C'est là que, pour la première fois, Tolstoï engage le combat contre la science et l'art; et jamais nul des combats suivants n'a dépassé en violence cette première rencontre. On s'étonne que, lors des récents assauts livrés chez nous à la vanité de la science et des intellectuels, personne n'ait songé à reprendre ces pages. Elles constituent le réquisitoire le plus terrible qu'on ait écrit contre «les eunuques de la science» et les «forbans de l'art», contre ces castes de l'esprit, qui, après avoir détruit ou asservi les anciennes castes régnantes: Église, État, Armée, se sont installées à leur place, et, sans vouloir ou pouvoir rien faire d'utile aux hommes, prétendent qu'on les admire et qu'on les serve aveuglément, édictant comme des dogmes une foi impudente
U|| en la science pour la science et en l'art pour l'art,—masque menteur dont cherche à se couvrir leur justification personnelle, l'apologie de leur monstrueux égoïsme et de leur néant.
U||«Ne me faites point dire, continue Tolstoï, que je nie l'art et la science. Non seulement je ne les nie pas, mais c'est en leur nom que je veux chasser les vendeurs du temple.»
U||La science et l'art sont aussi nécessaires que le pain et l'eau, même plus nécessaires.... La vraie science est la connaissance de la mission, et par conséquent du vrai bien de tous les hommes. Le vrai art est l'expression de la connaissance de la mission et du vrai bien de tous les hommes.
U||Et il loue ceux qui, «depuis que les hommes existent, ont sur les harpes et sur les tympanons, par les images et la parole, exprimé leur lutte contre la duplicité, leurs souffrances dans cette lutte, leur espoir dans le triomphe du bien, leur désespoir au triomphe du mal et leur enthousiasme à la vue prophétique de l'avenir».
U||Alors, il trace l'image du vrai artiste, dans une page brûlante d'ardeur douloureuse et mystique:
U||L'activité de la science et de l'art n'a de fruit que lorsqu'elle ne s'arroge aucun droit et ne se connaît que des devoirs. C'est seulement parce que cette activité est telle, parce que son essence est le sacrifice, que l'humanité l'honore. Les hommes qui sont appelés à servir les autres par le travail spirituel souffrent toujours dans l'accomplissement de cette tâche: car le monde spirituel naît seulement dans les souffrances et les tortures. Le sacrifice et la souffrance, tel est le sort du penseur et de l'artiste: car son but est le bien des hommes. Les hommes sont malheureux, ils souffrent, ils meurent; on n'a pas le temps de flâner et de s'amuser. Le penseur ou l'artiste ne reste jamais assis sur les hauteurs olympiennes, comme nous sommes habitués à le croire; il est toujours dans le trouble et dans l'émotion. Il doit décider et dire ce qui donnera le bien aux hommes, ce qui les délivrera des souffrances, et il ne l'a pas décidé, il ne l'a pas dit; et demain il sera peut-être trop tard
U||, et il mourra... Ce n'est pas celui qui est élevé dans un établissement où l'on forme des artistes et des savants (à dire vrai, on en fait des destructeurs de la science et de l'art); ce n'est pas celui qui reçoit des diplômes et un traitement, qui sera un penseur ou un artiste; c'est celui qui serait heureux de ne pas penser et de ne pas exprimer ce qui lui est mis dans l'âme, mais qui ne peut se dispenser de le faire: car il y est entraîné par deux forces invincibles: son besoin intérieur et son amour des hommes. Il n'y a pas d'artistes gras, jouisseurs, et satisfaits de soi[185].
U||Cette page splendide, qui jette un jour tragique sur le génie de Tolstoï, était écrite sous l'impression immédiate de la souffrance que lui causait le spectacle de la misère à Moscou et dans la conviction que la science et l'art étaient complices de tout le système actuel d'inégalité sociale et de violence hypocrite.—Cette conviction, jamais il ne la perdra. Mais l'impression de sa première rencontre avec la misère du monde ira en s'atténuant; la blessure est moins saignante[186]; et dans nul de ses livres suivants on ne retrouvera le frémissement de douleur et de colère vengeresse qui tremble en celui-ci. Nulle part, cette sublime profession de foi de l'artiste qui crée avec son sang, cette exaltation du sacrifice et de la souffrance, «qui sont le lot du penseur», ce mépris pour l'art olympien, à la façon de Gœthe. Les ouvrages où il reprendra ensuite la critique de l'art traiteront la question d'un point de vue littéraire et moins mystique; le problème de l'art y sera dégagé d
U||u fond de cette misère humaine, à laquelle Tolstoï ne peut penser sans délirer, comme le soir de sa visite à l'asile de nuit, où, rentré chez lui, il sanglote et crie désespérément.
U||Ce n'est pas à dire que ces ouvrages didactiques soient jamais froids. Froid, il lui est impossible de l'être. Jusqu'à la fin de sa vie, il restera celui qui écrivait à Fet:
U||Si l'on n'aime pas ses personnages, même les moindres, alors il faut les insulter de telle façon que le ciel en ait chaud, ou se moquer d'eux jusqu'à ce que le ventre en éclate[187].
U||Il ne s'en fait pas faute, dans ses écrits sur l'art. La partie négative—insultes et sarcasmes—y est d'une telle vigueur qu'elle est la seule qui ait frappé les artistes. Elle blessait trop violemment leurs superstitions et leurs susceptibilités pour qu'ils ne vissent point, dans l'ennemi de leur art, l'ennemi de tout art. Mais jamais la critique, chez Tolstoï, ne va sans la reconstruction. Jamais il ne détruit pour détruire, mais pour réédifier. Et dans sa modestie, il ne prétend même pas rien bâtir de nouveau; il défend l'Art, qui fut et sera toujours, contre les faux artistes qui l'exploitent et qui le déshonorent:
U||La science véritable et l'art véritable ont toujours existé et existeront toujours; il est impossible et inutile de les contester, m'écrivait-il, en 1887, dans une lettre qui devance de plus de dix ans sa fameuse Critique de l'Art[188]. Tout le mal d'aujourd'hui vient de ce que les gens soi-disant civilisés, ayant à leur côté les savants et les artistes, sont une caste privilégiée comme les prêtres. Et cette caste a tous les défauts de toutes les castes. Elle dégrade et rabaisse le principe en vertu duquel elle s'organise. Ce qu'on appelle dans notre monde les sciences et les arts n'est qu'un immense humbug, une grande superstition dans laquelle nous tombons ordinairement, dès que nous nous affranchissons de la vieille superstition de l'Église. Pour voir clair dans la route que nous devons suivre, il faut commencer par le commencement,—il faut relever le capuchon qui me tient chaud, mais qui me couvre la vue.—La tentation est grande. Nous naissons ou nous nous hissons sur les marches de l'
U||échelle; et nous nous trouvons parmi les privilégiés, les prêtres de la civilisation, de la Kultur, comme disent les Allemands. Il nous faut, comme aux prêtres brahmanes ou catholiques, beaucoup de sincérité et un grand amour du vrai, pour mettre en doute les principes qui nous assurent cette position avantageuse. Mais un homme sérieux, qui se pose la question de la vie, ne peut pas hésiter. Pour commencer à voir clair, il faut qu'il s'affranchisse de la superstition où il se trouve, quoiqu'elle lui soit avantageuse. C'est une condition sine quâ non.... Ne pas avoir de superstition. Se mettre dans l'état d'un enfant, ou d'un Descartes...
U||Cette superstition de l'art moderne, dans laquelle se complaisent des castes intéressées, «cet immense humbug», Tolstoï les dénonce dans son livre: Qu'est-ce que l'Art? Avec une rude verve, il en montre les ridicules, la pauvreté, l'hypocrisie, la corruption foncière. Il fait table rase. Il apporte à cette démolition la joie d'un enfant qui massacre ses jouets. Toute cette partie critique est souvent pleine d'humour, mais aussi d'injustice: c'est la guerre. Tolstoï se sert de toutes armes et frappe au hasard, sans regarder au visage ceux qu'il frappe. Bien souvent, il arrive—comme dans toutes les batailles—qu'il blesse tels de ceux qu'il eût été de son devoir de défendre: Ibsen ou Beethoven. C'est la faute de son emportement qui ne lui laisse pas le temps de réfléchir assez avant d'agir, de sa passion qui l'aveugle souvent sur la faiblesse de ses raisons, et—disons-le—c'est aussi la faute de sa culture artistique incomplète.
U||En dehors de ses lectures littéraires, que peut-il bien connaître de l'art contemporain? Qu'a-t-il pu voir de la peinture, qu'a-t-il pu entendre de la musique européenne, ce gentilhomme campagnard, qui a passé les trois quarts de sa vie dans son village moscovite, qui n'est plus venu en Europe depuis 1860;—et qu'y a-t-il vu alors, à part les écoles, qui seules l'intéressaient?—Pour la peinture, il en parle d'après ouï-dire, citant pêle-mêle, parmi les décadents, Puvis, Manet, Monet, Bœcklin, Stuck, Klinger, admirant de confiance, à cause de leurs bons sentiments, Jules Breton et Lhermitte, méprisant Michel-Ange, et, parmi les peintres de l'âme, ne faisant pas une fois mention de Rembrandt.—Pour la musique, il la sent beaucoup mieux[189], mais ne la connaît guère: il en reste à ses impressions d'enfance, s'en tient à ceux qui étaient déjà des classiques vers 1840, n'a rien appris à connaître depuis, (à part Tschaikovsky, dont la musique le fait pleurer); il jette au fond du mê
U||me sac Brahms et Richard Strauss, fait la leçon à Beethoven[190], et, pour juger Wagner, croit en savoir assez après une seule représentation de Siegfried où il arrive après le lever du rideau et d'où il part au milieu du second acte[191].—Pour la littérature, il est (cela va sans dire) un peu mieux informé. Mais par quelle étrange aberration évite-t-il de juger les écrivains russes qu'il connaît bien et se mêle-t-il de faire la loi aux poètes étrangers, dont l'esprit est le plus loin du sien et dont il feuillette les livres avec une hautaine négligence[192]!
U||Son intrépide assurance augmente encore avec l'âge. Il en vient à écrire un livre, pour prouver que Shakespeare «n'était pas un artiste».
U||Il pouvait être n'importe quoi; mais il n'était pas un artiste[193].
U||Admirez cette certitude! Tolstoï ne doute pas. Il ne discute pas. Il a la vérité. Il vous dira:
U||La Neuvième Symphonie est une œuvre qui désunit les hommes[194].
U||Ou:
U||En dehors de l'air célèbre pour violon de Bach, du Nocturne en Es dur de Chopin, et d'une dizaine de morceaux, non pas même entiers, choisis parmi les œuvres de Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Beethoven et Chopin,... tout le reste doit être rejeté et méprisé, comme un art qui désunit les hommes.
U||Ou:
U||Je vais prouver que Shakespeare ne peut être tenu même pour un écrivain de quatrième ordre. Et, comme peintre de caractères, il est nul.
U||Que le reste de l'humanité soit d'un autre avis, n'est pas pour l'arrêter: au contraire!
U||Mon opinion, écrit-il fièrement, est entièrement différente de celle qui s'est établie sur Shakespeare, dans tout le monde européen.
U||Dans sa hantise du mensonge, il le flaire partout; et plus une idée est généralement répandue, plus il se hérisse contre elle; il s'en défie, il y soupçonne, comme il dit à propos de la gloire de Shakespeare, «une de ces influences épidémiques qu'ont toujours subies les hommes. Telles, les Croisades du moyen âge, la croyance aux sorciers, la recherche de la pierre philosophale, la passion des tulipes. Les hommes ne voient la folie de ces influences qu'une fois qu'ils en sont débarrassés. Avec le développement de la presse, ces épidémies sont devenues particulièrement extraordinaires.»—Et il donne comme type le plus récent de ces maladies contagieuses l'Affaire Dreyfus, dont il parle, lui, l'ennemi de toutes les injustices, le défenseur de tous les opprimés, avec une indifférence dédaigneuse[195]. Exemple bien frappant des excès où peuvent l'entraîner sa méfiance du mensonge et cette répulsion instinctive contre «les épidémies morales» dont il s'accusait lui-même, sans pouv
U||oir la combattre. Revers des vertus humaines, inconcevable aveuglement qui entraîne ce voyant des âmes, cet évocateur des forces passionnées, à traiter le Roi Lear «d'œuvre inepte» et la fière Cordelia de «créature sans aucun caractère[196]».
U||Notez qu'il voit très bien certains des défauts réels de Shakespeare, défauts que nous n'avons pas la sincérité d'avouer: ainsi, le caractère artificiel de la langue poétique, uniformément prêtée à tous les personnages, la rhétorique de la passion, de l'héroïsme, voire de la simplicité. Et je comprends parfaitement qu'un Tolstoï, qui fut le moins littérateur de tous les écrivains, ait manqué de sympathie pour l'art de celui qui fut le plus génial des hommes de lettres. Mais pourquoi perdre son temps à parler de ce qu'on ne peut comprendre, et quelle valeur peuvent avoir des jugements sur un monde qui vous est fermé?
U||Valeur nulle, si nous y cherchons la clef de ces mondes étrangers. Valeur inestimable, si nous leur demandons la clef de l'art de Tolstoï. On ne réclame pas d'un génie créateur l'impartialité critique. Quand un Wagner, quand un Tolstoï parlent de Beethoven ou de Shakespeare, ce n'est pas de Beethoven ou de Shakespeare qu'ils parlent, c'est d'eux-mêmes: ils exposent leur idéal. Ils n'essaient même pas de nous donner le change. Pour juger Shakespeare, Tolstoï ne tâche pas de se faire «objectif». Bien plus, il reproche à Shakespeare son art objectif. Le peintre de Guerre et Paix, le maître de l'art impersonnel n'a pas assez de mépris pour ces critiques allemands, qui, à la suite de Goethe, «inventèrent Shakespeare» et «la théorie que l'art doit être objectif, c'est-à-dire représenter les événements, en dehors de toute valeur morale,—ce qui est la négation délibérée de l'objet religieux de l'art».
U||Ainsi, c'est du haut d'une foi que Tolstoï édicte ses jugements artistiques. Ne cherchez dans ses critiques nulle arrière-pensée personnelle. Il ne se donne pas en exemple; il est aussi impitoyable pour ses œuvres que pour celles des autres[197]. Que veut-il donc, et que vaut pour l'art l'idéal religieux qu'il propose?
U||Cet idéal est magnifique. Le mot «art religieux» risque de tromper sur l'ampleur de la conception. Bien loin de rétrécir l'art, Tolstoï l'élargit. L'art, dit-il, est partout.
U||L'art pénètre toute notre vie; ce que nous nommons art: théâtres, concerts, livres, expositions, n'en est qu'une infime partie. Notre vie est remplie de manifestations artistiques de toutes sortes, depuis les jeux d'enfants jusqu'aux offices religieux. L'art et la parole sont les deux organes du progrès humain. L'un fait communier les cœurs, et l'autre les pensées. Si l'un des deux est faussé, la société est malade. L'art d'aujourd'hui est faussé.
U||Depuis la Renaissance, on ne peut plus parler d'un art des nations chrétiennes. Les classes se sont séparées. Les riches, les privilégiés ont prétendu s'arroger le monopole de l'art; et ils ont fait de leur plaisir le critérium de la beauté. En s'éloignant des pauvres, l'art s'est appauvri.
U||La catégorie des émotions éprouvées par ceux qui ne travaillent pas pour vivre est bien plus limitée que les émotions de ceux qui travaillent. Les sentiments de notre société actuelle se ramènent à trois: l'orgueil, la sensualité et la lassitude de vivre. Ces trois sentiments et leurs ramifications constituent presque exclusivement le sujet de l'art des riches.
U||Il infecte le monde, il pervertit le peuple, il propage la dépravation sexuelle, il est devenu le pire obstacle à la réalisation du bonheur humain. Il est d'ailleurs sans beauté véritable, sans naturel, sans sincérité,—un art affecté, fabriqué, cérébral.
U||En face de ce mensonge d'esthètes, de ce passe-temps de riches, élevons l'art vivant, l'art humain, celui qui unit les hommes, de toutes classes, de toutes nations. Le passé nous en offre de glorieux modèles.
U||Toujours la majorité des hommes a compris et aimé ce que nous considérons comme l'art le plus élevé: l'épopée de la Genèse, les paraboles de l'Évangile, les légendes, les contes, les chansons populaires.
U||L'art le plus grand est celui qui traduit la conscience religieuse de l'époque. N'entendez point par là une doctrine de l'Église. «Chaque société a une conception religieuse de la vie: c'est l'idéal du plus grand bonheur auquel tend cette société.» Tous en ont un sentiment plus ou moins clair; quelques hommes d'avant-garde l'expriment nettement.
U||Il existe toujours une conscience religieuse. C'est le lit où coule le fleuve[198].
U||La conscience religieuse de notre époque est l'aspiration au bonheur réalisé par la fraternité des hommes. Il n'y a d'art véritable que celui qui travaille à cette union. Le plus haut est celui qui l'accomplit directement par la puissance de l'amour. Mais il en est un autre qui participe à la même tâche, en combattant par les armes de l'indignation et du mépris tout ce qui s'oppose à la fraternité. Tels, les romans de Dickens, ceux de Dostoievsky, les Misérables de Hugo, les tableaux de Millet. Même sans atteindre à ces hauteurs, tout art qui représente la vie journalière avec sympathie et vérité rapproche entre eux les hommes. Ainsi, le Don Quichotte et le théâtre de Molière. Il est vrai que ce dernier genre d'art pèche habituellement par son réalisme trop minutieux et par la pauvreté des sujets, «quand on les compare aux modèles antiques, comme la sublime histoire de Joseph». La précision excessive des détails nuit aux œuvres, qui ne peuvent, pour cette raison, devenir univer
U||selles.
U||Les œuvres modernes sont gâtées par un réalisme, qu'il serait plus juste de taxer de provincialisme en art.
U||Ainsi Tolstoï condamne, sans hésiter, le principe de son génie propre. Que lui importe de se sacrifier tout entier à l'avenir,—et qu'il ne reste plus rien de lui?
U||L'art de l'avenir ne continuera plus celui du présent, il sera fondé sur d'autres bases. Il ne sera plus la propriété d'une caste. L'art n'est pas un métier, il est l'expression de sentiments vrais. Or, l'artiste ne peut éprouver un sentiment vrai que lorsqu'il ne s'isole pas, lorsqu'il vit de l'existence naturelle à l'homme. C'est pourquoi celui qui se trouve à l'abri de la vie est dans les pires conditions pour créer.
U||Dans l'avenir, «les artistes seront tous les hommes doués». L'activité artistique deviendra accessible à tous «par l'introduction dans les écoles élémentaires de l'enseignement de la musique et de la peinture, qui sera donné à l'enfant, en même temps que les premiers éléments de la grammaire». Au reste, l'art n'aura plus besoin d'une technique compliquée, comme celle d'à présent; il s'acheminera vers la simplicité, la netteté, la concision, qui sont le propre de l'art classique et sain, de l'art homérique[199]. Comme il sera beau de traduire dans cet art aux lignes pures des sentiments universels! Composer un conte ou une chanson, dessiner une image pour des millions d'êtres, a bien plus d'importance—et de difficulté—que d'écrire un roman ou une symphonie[200]. C'est un domaine immense et presque vierge. Grâce à de telles œuvres, les hommes apprendront le bonheur de l'union fraternelle.
U||L'art doit supprimer la violence, et seul il peut le faire. Sa mission est de faire régner le royaume de Dieu, c'est-à-dire de l'Amour[201].
U||Qui de nous n'épouserait ces généreuses paroles? Et qui ne voit qu'avec beaucoup d'utopies et quelques puérilités, la conception de Tolstoï est vivante et féconde! Oui, l'ensemble de notre art n'est que l'expression d'une caste, qui se subdivise elle-même, d'une nation à l'autre, en petits clans ennemis. Il n'y a pas en Europe une seule âme d'artiste qui réalise en elle l'union des partis et des races. La plus universelle, en notre temps, fut celle même de Tolstoï. En elle nous nous sommes aimés, hommes de tous les peuples et de toutes les classes. Et qui a, comme nous, goûté la joie puissante de ce vaste amour, ne saurait plus se satisfaire des lambeaux de la grande âme humaine, que nous offre l'art des cénacles européens.
U||La plus belle théorie n'a de prix que par les œuvres où elle s'accomplit. Chez Tolstoï, théorie et création sont toujours unies, comme foi et action. Dans le même temps où il élaborait sa Critique de l'Art, il donnait des modèles de l'art nouveau qu'il voulait,—des deux formes de l'art, l'une plus haute, l'autre moins pure, mais toutes deux «religieuses», au sens le plus humain,—l'une travaillant à l'union des hommes par l'amour, l'autre en livrant combat au monde ennemi de l'amour. Il écrivait ces chefs-d'œuvre: la Mort d'Ivan Iliitch (1884-86), les Récits et les Contes populaires (1881-86), la Puissance des Ténèbres (1886), la Sonate à Kreutzer (1889) et Maître et Serviteur (1895)[202]. Au sommet et au terme de cette période artistique, comme une cathédrale aux deux tours, symbolisant l'une, l'amour éternel, l'autre, la haine du monde, s'élève Résurrection (1899).
U||Toutes ces œuvres se distinguent des précédentes par des caractères artistiques nouveaux. Les idées de Tolstoï n'avaient pas seulement changé sur l'objet de l'art, mais sur sa forme. On est frappé, dans Qu'est-ce que l'art? ou dans le livre sur Shakespeare, des principes de goût et d'expression qu'il énonce. Ils sont, pour la plupart, en contradiction avec ses plus grandes œuvres antérieures. «Netteté, simplicité, concision», lisons-nous dans Qu'est-ce que l'art? Mépris de l'effet matériel. Condamnation du réalisme minutieux.—Et dans le Shakespeare: idéal tout classique de perfection et de mesure. «Sans le sentiment de la mesure, il ne saurait exister d'artistes.»—Et si, dans les œuvres nouvelles, le vieil homme ne parvient pas à s'effacer tout à fait, avec son génie d'analyse et sa sauvagerie native, qui, par certains côtés, s'accuse même davantage, son art s'est profondément modifié par la netteté du dessin plus vigoureusement accentué, par les raccourcis d'âmes, par l
U||a concentration du drame intérieur, ramassé sur lui-même comme une bête de proie qui se tend pour bondir[203], par l'universalité de l'émotion, dégagée des détails passagers d'un réalisme local, enfin, par la langue imagée, savoureuse, qui sent la terre.
U||Son amour du peuple lui avait depuis longtemps fait goûter la beauté de la langue populaire. Enfant, il avait été bercé par les récits des conteurs mendiants. Homme fait et écrivain célèbre, il éprouvait une jouissance artistique à causer avec ses paysans.
U||Ces hommes-là, disait-il plus tard à M. Paul Boyer[204], sont des maîtres. Autrefois, quand je causais avec eux, ou avec ces errants qui vont, le bissac à l'épaule, par nos campagnes, je notais soigneusement telles de leurs expressions que j'entendais pour la première fois, oubliées souvent de notre langue littéraire moderne, mais toujours frappées au bon vieux coin russe.... Oui, le génie de la langue vit en ces hommes....
U||Il devait y être d'autant plus sensible que son esprit n'était pas encombré de littérature[205]. A force de vivre loin des villes, au milieu des paysans, il s'était fait un peu la façon de penser du peuple. Il en avait la dialectique lente, le bon sens raisonneur qui se traîne pas à pas, avec de brusques saccades qui déconcertent, la manie de répéter une idée dont on est convaincu, de la répéter dans les mêmes termes, sans se lasser, indéfiniment.
U||Mais c'en étaient plutôt les défauts que les qualités. A la longue seulement, il prit garde au génie latent du parler populaire, à la saveur d'images, à la crudité poétique, à la plénitude de sagesse légendaire. Dès l'époque de Guerre et Paix, il avait commencé d'en subir l'influence. En mars 1872, il écrivait à Strakov:
U||J'ai changé le procédé de ma langue et de mon écriture. La langue du peuple a des sons pour exprimer tout ce que peut dire le poète, et elle m'est très chère. Elle est le meilleur régulateur poétique. Veut-on dire quelque chose de trop, d'emphatique ou de faux, la langue ne le supporte pas. Au lieu que notre langue littéraire n'a pas de squelette, on peut la tirailler dans tous les sens, tout ressemble à de la littérature[206].
U||Il ne dut pas seulement au peuple des modèles de style; il lui dut plusieurs de ses inspirations. En 1877, un conteur de bylines vint à Iasnaïa Poliana, et Tolstoï nota plusieurs de ses récits. Du nombre étaient la légende De quoi vivent les hommes et les Trois Vieillards, qui devinrent, comme on sait, deux des plus beaux Récits et Contes populaires que Tolstoï publia quelques années plus tard[207].
U||Œuvre unique dans l'art moderne. Œuvre plus haute que l'art: qui songe, en la lisant, à la littérature? L'esprit de l'Évangile, le chaste amour de tous les hommes frères, s'unit à la bonhomie souriante de la sagesse populaire. Simplicité, limpidité, bonté de cœur ineffable,—et cette lueur surnaturelle qui, si naturellement, baigne le tableau par moments! Elle enveloppe d'une auréole la figure centrale, le vieillard Elysée[208], ou plane dans l'échoppe du cordonnier Martin,—celui qui, par sa lucarne au ras du sol, voit passer les pieds des gens et à qui le Seigneur fait visite, sous la figure des pauvres qu'a secourus le bon savetier[209]. Souvent se mêle, en ces récits, aux paraboles évangéliques, je ne sais quel parfum de légendes orientales, de ces Mille et une Nuits, que Tolstoï aimait depuis l'enfance[210]. Parfois aussi, la lueur fantastique se fait sinistre et donne au conte une grandeur effrayante. Tel le Moujik Pakhom[211], l'homme qui se tue à acquérir beaucoup de terre, t
U||oute la terre dont il fera le tour, en marchant pendant une journée. Et il meurt en arrivant.
U||Sur la colline, le starschina, assis par terre, le regardait courir, et il s'esclafait, se tenant le ventre à deux mains. Et Pakhom tomba.
U||—«Ah! Bravo, mon gaillard, tu as acquis beaucoup de terre.»
U||Le starschina se leva, jeta au domestique de Pakhom une pioche:
U||—«Voilà, enterre-le.»
U||Le domestique resta seul. Il creusa à Pakhom une fosse, juste de la longueur des pieds à la tête: trois archines,—et il l'enterra.
U||Presque tous ces contes renferment sous leur poétique enveloppe la même morale évangélique de renoncement et de pardon:
U||Ne te venge pas de qui t'offense[212].
U||Ne résiste pas à qui te fait du mal[213].
U||C'est à moi qu'appartient la vengeance, dit le Seigneur[214].
U||Et partout et toujours, pour conclusion, l'amour. Tolstoï, qui voulait fonder un art pour tous les hommes, a atteint du premier coup à l'universalité. L'œuvre a eu, dans le monde entier, un succès qui ne peut cesser: car elle est épurée de tous les éléments périssables de l'art; il n'y a plus rien là que d'éternel.
U||La Puissance des Ténèbres ne s'élève pas à cette auguste simplicité de cœur; elle n'y prétend point: c'est l'autre tranchant du glaive. D'un côté, le rêve de l'amour divin. De l'autre, l'atroce réalité. On peut voir, en lisant ce drame, si la foi de Tolstoï et son amour du peuple étaient jamais capables de lui faire idéaliser le peuple et trahir la vérité!
U||Tolstoï, si gauche dans la plupart de ses essais dramatiques[215], atteint ici à la maîtrise. Les caractères et l'action sont posés avec aisance: le bellâtre Nikita, la passion emportée et sensuelle d'Anissia, la bonhomie cynique de la vieille Matrena, qui couve maternellement l'adultère de son fils, et la sainteté du vieux Akim à la langue bègue,—Dieu vivant dans un corps ridicule.—Puis, c'est la chute de Nikita, faible et sans méchanceté, mais englué dans le péché, roulant au fond du crime, malgré ses efforts pour se retenir sur la pente; sa mère et sa femme l'entraînent...
U||Les moujiks ne valent pas cher. Mais les babas! Des fauves! Elles n'ont peur de rien... Vous autres sœurs, vous êtes des millions de Russes, et vous êtes toutes aveugles comme des taupes, vous ne savez rien, vous ne savez rien!... Le moujik, lui au moins, il peut apprendre quelque chose, au cabaret, ou qui sait? en prison ou à la caserne; mais la baba,... quoi? Elle n'a rien vu, rien entendu. Telle elle a grandi, telle elle meurt... Elles sont comme des petits chiens aveugles, qui vont courant et heurtant de la tête contre les ordures. Elles ne savent que leurs sottes chansons: «Ho-ho! Ho-ho!»... Eh quoi! Ho-ho?... Elles ne savent pas[216].

U||SUURI SIELU MAHATMA…[1]
U||Maailmankaikkeuden olemukseen sulautunut ihminen.
U||I
U||Tummat, rauhalliset silmät. Pieni, heikko mies, kasvot laihat, korvat suuret, ulkonevat. Päässä valkea myssy, verhona valkea, karhea kangas, jalat paljaat. Elää riisistä ja hedelmistä, juo vain vettä, makaa lattialla, nukkuu vähän, tekee työtä lakkaamatta.
U||Hänen ulkomuodossaan ei ole mitään eriskummallista. Alussa herättää hänessä huomiota vain suuren kärsivällisyyden ja suuren rakkauden ilme. Pearson, joka näkee hänet v. 1913 Etelä-Afrikassa, johtuu muistamaan Fransiskus Assisilaista. Hän on yksinkertainen kuin lapsi, [2] lempeä ja kohtelias, yksinpä vastustajilleenkin, [3] ehdottoman rehellinen. [4] Hän arvostelee itseään nöyrästi, on siinä määrin tunnontarkka, että tuntuu kuin epäilevän ja sanovan: »Olen erehtynyt»; ei peitä koskaan erehdyksiään, ei käytä kompromissia eikä diplomatiaa, karttaa liioiteltua kaunopuheisuutta, ei ainakaan ajattele sitä; [5] hän inhosi kansan mielenosoituksia, joita hänen henkilönsä oli aiheuttanut ja joissa hänen heikot jäsenensä olivat joskus ruhjoutumisen vaarassa, jollei hänen ystävänsä Maulana Šaukat Ali olisi vankalla ruumiillaan ollut suojamuurina hänelle — hän oli sanan täydessä merkityksessä sairas väkijoukon häntä ihaillessa; [6] pohjimmaltaan hän epäilee ja i
U||nhoaa hillitöntä rahvasta, hän tuntee olonsa mukavaksi vain vähemmistössä ja itsensä onnelliseksi vain yksinäisyydessä, kuunnellessaan omantunnon hiljaista pientä ääntä, joka käskee ja säätää… [7]
U||Tässä siis mies, joka on nostattanut kapinaan kolmesataa miljoonaa ihmistä, järkyttänyt Brittein valtakuntaa ja tuonut ihmispolitiikan huomioon mahtavimman kansainliikkeen, mikä liki kahdentuhannen vuoden aikana on kuohuttanut maailmaa.

U||Hänen oikea nimensä on Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Hän syntyi Luoteis-Intiassa, pienessä, puolittain itsenäisessä Porbandar nimisessä valtiossa sen samannimisessä pääkaupungissa eli »Valkeassa kaupungissa» Oman-lahden rannalla lokakuun 2 p:nä 1869. Hänen heimonsa oli tulista, levotonta rotua, vielä äsken kansalaissotien kiihoittamaa. Käytännöllistä rotua, jolla oli liikevaistoa ja joka kävi kukoistavaa kauppaa Arapianmerellä Adenista Zanzibariin saakka. Sekä hänen isoisänsä että isänsä olivat molemmat olleet pääministereitä, mutta molemmat olivat riippumattomuutensa takia joutuneet epäsuosioon ja saaneet paeta, koska heidän henkeänsä uhattiin. Hän oli peräisin rikkaasta, henkevästä, sivistyneestä ympäristöstä, mutta ei ylimmästä kastista. Hänen vanhempansa kuuluivat hindulaisuuden Jain-koulukuntaan, jonka suurimpia periaatteita on ahimsâ. [8] Tämän aatteen hän tuli sittemmin voitokkaasti todistamaan maailmalle.
U||Džainalaisten mielestä kykenee rakkaus enemmän kuin järki viemään Jumalan luo. Mahatman isä ei antanut yhtään arvoa rahalle ja jätti sitä vähän omilleen, tuhlattuaan melkein kaiken hyväntekeväisyystarkoituksiin. Äiti, ankarasti uskonnollinen, oli hindulainen Pyhä Elisabet, joka paastosi, antoi almuja ja valvoi sairaiden luona. Perheessä luettiin säännöllisesti Râmâyanaa. Pojan ensimmäinen kasvatus oli uskottu eräälle bramaanille, joka pani hänet kertaamaan Višnun lukuja. [9] Mutta myöhemmin hän valitti sitä, ettei hän ollut koskaan oikein hyvin oppinut sanskriittia: siinä yksi syy hänen salaiseen vihaansa englantilaista kasvatusta kohtaan, jonka takia häneltä jäi löytämättä oman kielensä aarteet. Hän tuntee kyllä erinomaisesti hindujen pyhät käsikirjoitukset, mutta Vedoja ja Upanišadeja hän lukee vain käännöksinä. [10]
U||Jo koulussa ollessaan hän oli elänyt vakavan uskonnollisen murroksen. Kapinoiden epäjumalista ja turmeltunutta hindulaisuutta vastaan hän oli — tai luuli olevansa — vähän aikaa jumalankieltäjä. Tovereinensa hän meni jumalattomuudessaan niin pitkälle, että söi salaa lihaa (hirvein pyhänhäväistys mihin hindu voi tehdä itsensä syylliseksi!) Hän oli sitten vähällä kuolla sen aiheuttamasta kauhusta ja inhosta. [11]
U||Mentyään jo lapsena naimisiin [12] hän lähti yhdeksäntoistavuotiaana Englantiin Lontoon yliopistoon ja oikeuskouluun täydentämään opintojaan. Äiti ei suostunut hänen lähtöönsä ennenkuin oli häneltä ottanut kolme džainilaista lupausta, jotka velvoittivat pidättäytymään viinistä, lihasta ja sukupuoliyhteydestä.
U||Hän saapui Lontooseen syyskuussa 1888. Ensimmäisten epävarmuutta ja pettymystä merkinneiden kuukausien jälkeen — hän oli tuhlannut lapsellisesti paljon aikaa ja rahaa tullakseen, kuten hän sanoo, englantilaiseksi herrasmieheksi, — hän pakotti itsensä täsmälliseen elämään ja ankaraan työhön. Ystävät opettivat häntä tutustumaan raamattuun, mutta aika ei ollut vielä tullut sen tajuamiseen. Ensimmäiset kirjat häntä väsyttivät, eikä hän joutunut 2. Mooseksenkirjaa edemmäksi. Sitävastoin hän juuri Lontoossa keksi Bhagavad Gitan kauneuden. Hän juopui siitä. Se oli valo, jota pieni maanpakolaishindu tarvitsi. Se antoi hänelle takaisin uskon. Hän tunsi taaskin pelastuksen olevan hänelle mahdollisen vain hindujen uskonnon kautta.»[13]
U||Hän palasi Intiaan 1891. Surullinen paluu. Hänen äitinsä oli juuri kuollut, ja uutinen oli häneltä salattu. Hänestä tuli asianajaja Bombayn ylioikeuteen. Muutamia vuosia myöhemmin hän oli kieltävä tämän toimensa, jonka hän tuomitsi epämoraaliseksi. Jopa hän tätä tointa hoitaessaan pidätti itselleen oikeuden olla jatkamatta asiaa, jos hänestä siinä ilmeni vääryyttä.
U||Jo tähän aikaan eräät suuret intialaiset luonteet herättivät hänessä aavistuksia hänen omasta tulevasta kutsumuksestaan: Bombayn »kruunuton kuningas» parsi Dadabhai sekä professori Gokhale, jotka molemmatkin hehkuivat uskonnollista rakkautta Intian maahan ja kansaan. Gokhale, isänmaansa parhaita valtiomiehiä ja intialaisen kasvatuksen ensimmäisiä parantajia; Dadabhai, intialaisen kansallisuusaatteen perustaja (Gandhin todistuksen mukaan);[14] molemmat samalla myös viisauden ja lempeyden mestareita. Dadabhai kiinnittäessään huomionsa Gandhin nuorekkaaseen intomieleen antoi hänelle 1892 ensimmäisen käytännöllisen Ahimsâ -opetuksen julkisessa elämässä. Se on sankarillisen ihmisen passiivisuutta jos voi näitä kahta sanaa yhdistää, sielun intohimoista pyrkimystä vastustamaan pahaa ei pahalla, vaan rakkaudella. Me palaamme tähän taikavoi- maiseen asiaan, joka on Intian antama ylevä sanoma muulle maailmalle.
U||Vuonna 1893 alkaa Gandhin intialaistoiminta. Se jakautuu kahteen ajanjaksoon. Vuosina 1893-1914 hänellä on vaikutuskenttänä Etelä-Afrikka. Vuodesta 1914 hän on toiminut Intiassa.
U||Se seikka, että tällä kaksikymmenvuotisella toiminnalla Etelä-Afrikassa ei ole ollut enempää kaikupohjaa Europassa, todistaa meidän poliitikkojemme, historioitsijaimme, ajattelijoidemme ja uskonnonmiestemme uskomattoman ahdasta näkökulmaa; sillä se on sielun sankariutta, joka on vailla vertojaan meidän aikoinamme, ei ainoastaan voimansa ja uhrautumisensa kestävyyden, vaan lopullisen voittonsakin puolesta.
U||Vuosina 1890—91 asusti Etelä-Afrikassa, etupäässä Natalissa, 150.000 intialaista. Tämän vieraan kansan tulo herätti sikäläisissä valkoisissa kansanaineksissa muukalaisvihan, jota hallitus kävi kannattamaan maanpakotoimenpiteilläkin. Se tahtoi kieltää aasialaisten maahanmuuton ja pakottaa niitä lähtemään pois, jotka jo olivat tänne vakituisesti asettuneet. Järjestelmällinen vaino teki näiden elämän sietämättömäksi: rasittavat verot, nöyryyttävät poliisitoimenpiteet, julkiset häväistykset ja piankin omavaltaiset rankaisut, ryöstöt, hävitykset — mikä kaikki tapahtui valkean sivistyksen lipun alla.
U||Vuonna 1893 Gandhi saapui Etelä-Afrikaan, kutsuttuna Pretoriaan ajamaan erästä tärkeää asiaa. Hän oli täysin tietämätön intialaisten asemasta Afrikassa. Heti ensimmäisillä askeleillaan Matalissa, mutta etenkin hollantilaisessa Transvaalissa, hän teki kauheita havaintoja. Tämä ylhäissäätyinen hindu, jota aina oli kohdeltu hyvin Englannissa ja joka aikaisemmin oli pitänyt eurooppalaisia ystävinään, joutui mitä karkeimpien solvauksien alaiseksi: hänet ajettiin ulos hotelleista, junista, häntä herjattiin, lyötiin korvalle, potkittiin. Hän olisi palannut heti Intiaan, ellei häntä olisi kiinnittänyt asiakkaihinsa kokovuotinen sitoumus. Näiden kahdentoista kuukauden aikana hän oppi hallitsemaan itseään. Mutta kun hän määräajan kuluttua kiirehti palaamaan takaisin, sai hän tietää, että hallitus valmisteli lakiehdotusta, joka riistäisi intialaisilta heidän viimeisenkin turvansa. Afrikan intialaisilla ei ollut voimaa eikä tahtoa taistella, järjestymättömiä ja demorali
U||soituja kun olivat. He tarvitsivat johtajaa, sielua. Gandhi uhrautui. Hän jäi.
U||Silloin saa alkunsa omantunnon jatkuva taistelu valtion voimaa ja raakoja joukkoja vastaan. Toimien vielä tähän aikaan asianajajana hän aloitti taistelun osoittamalla juriidisesti laittomaksi asiakirjan, jolla aasialaiset suljettiin pois Afrikasta; ja huolimatta mitä myrkyllisimmästä vastustuksesta hän sai asiansa puolelle kirjaimellisesti, joskaan ei käytännössä, Matalin ja Lontoon yleisen mielipiteen. Hän hankkii allekirjoituksia suunnattoman suuriin anomuksiin, saa pystyyn Matalin intialaisen Kongressin, muodostaa intialaisen kasvatuksen yhdistyksen; vähän myöhemmin hän perustaa lehden Indian Opinion, jota julaistiin paitsi englanniksi myös kolmella intialaisella kielellä. Haluten edelleen varmistaa kansalaisilleen siedettävän aseman Afrikassa, voidakseen paremmin heitä puolustaa, hän teki itsensä samanarvoiseksi heidän kanssaan. Hänellä oli Johannesburgissa tuottava asiakasjoukko;[15] hän jätti sen vihkiytyäkseen köyhyyteen, kuten Fransiskus Assisilainen. Kurjien ja vainott
U||ujen intialaisten kanssa hän elää yhteistä elämää, hän kärsii koettelemuksissa heidän kanssaan ja pyhittää heidät: määrää heille »pois vastarinta» -lain. Hän perustaa v. 1904 Phoenixissä, lähellä Durbania, maanviljelyssiirtolan ihailemansa Tolstoin suunnitelmien mukaan. [16] Hän kerää sinne intialaisia, hankkii heille maita ja taivuttaa heidät juhlalliseen köyhyyden lupaukseen. Hän itse ottaa osakseen mitä orjallisimmat tehtävät. Vuosikausia kestää tämä hiljainen kansa siellä vastarinnassaan hallitusta vastaan. Se on vetäytynyt pois kaupungeista; maan teollisuuselämä onkin senvuoksi lamaantunut. Se on uskonnollista lahkoilua, jota vastaan kaikkinainen väkivalta murskautuu, kuten keisarillisen Rooman valtiomahti ensimmäisten kristittyjen yhteistahtoa vastaan. Mutta hyvin harva kristitty olisi anteeksiantamus- ja rakkausopissaan mennyt niin pitkälle, että Gandhin tavoin olisi tullut uhattujen vainoojiensa avuksi. Joka kerta kun Etelä-Afrikan valtiota uhkasivat ankar
U||at vaarat, uhrasi Gandhi intialaisten puolueettomuuden yleiselle hyödylle ja tarjosi heti apuaan. V. 1899, buurisodan aikaan, hän muodosti intialaisen Punaisen Ristin, jota kaksi kertaa päiväkäskyssä kiitettiin taisteluissa osoitetun rohkeuden vuoksi. V. 1904 puhkesi rutto Johannesburgissa: Gandhi järjesti sairaalan; v. 1906 alkuasukkaat Natalissa nousivat kapinaan: Gandhi otti osaa sotaan paariosaston johtajana, ja Natalin hallitus kiitti häntä siitä julkisesti.
U||Hänen ritarilliset palveluksensa eivät hillinneet muukalaisvihan raivoa. Useat kerrat[17] heitettynä vankilaan — (kerrankin juuri saatuaan julkiset kiitokset Natalin-sodan yhteydessä) — tuomittuna tyrmään ja pakkotöihin, raivoisan kansanjoukon pieksämänä[18], kerran heitettynä kuolemaan, Gandhi tunsi kaikki kärsimykset ja kaikki nöyryytykset. Ei mikään horjuttanut hänen uskoaan. Se kasvoi koettelemuksesta. V. 1908 hän kirjoitti vastaukseksi Etelä-Afrikan väkivaltasuunnalle kuuluisan pikku kirjansa: Hind Swarâj (Intian homerulen), sankarillisen rakkauden evankeliumin.[19]
U||Taistelu kesti kaksikymmentä vuotta ja saavutti katkeruuden huipun vuosina 1907—1914. Etelä-Afrikan hallitus oli äkillisesti julkaissut uuden aasialaisia koskevan lain, huolimatta Englannin valistuneitten piirien vastustuksesta. Silloin Gandhi järjesti »pois vastarinta» -liikkeen koko sen laajuudessa. Syyskuussa v. 1906 Johannesburgissa kokoontuneet intialaiset vannoivat juhlallisesti »Passiivisen vastarinnan» valan. Kaikki aasialaiset, mitä heimoa, kastia, uskontoa olivatkin, rikkaat sekä köyhät, liittyivät yhteiseen kieltäymykseen; myöskin Afrikan kiinalaiset yhtyivät läheisesti intialaisiin. Heitä vangittiin tuhansittain; kyllin suurten vankilain puutteessa heitä suljettiin kaivoksiin. Mutta vankeus näytti heitä vain houkuttelevan. Kenraali Smuts, joka heitä vainosi, nimitti heitä »omaatuntoaan seuraaviksi lainrikkojiksi». Gandhi vangittiin kolme kertaa.[20] Oli kuolleita ja marttyyrejä. Liike kasvoi. V. 1913 se levisi Transvaalista Nataliin. Hirvittävät lakot, intohimoiset k
U||okoukset, intialaisten joukkomarssi läpi Transvaalin, kaikki ne kiihoittivat äärimmilleen yleisen mielipiteen sekä Afrikassa että Aasiassa. Suuttumus voitti Intian, ja varakuningas lordi Harding ryhtyi itse Madrasissa julistamaan sovintoa.
U||Suuren sielun kesyttämätön sitkeys ja lumous tekivät vaikutuksensa; voima polvistui sankarillisen lempeyden edessä.[21] Hindujen asian kaikkein kiihkein vastustaja, kenraali Smuts, joka v. 1909 julisti, ettei hän koskaan pyyhkisi riidanalaisesta laista erästä hinduille loukkaavaa kohtaa, tunnusti viisi vuotta myöhemmin olevansa onnellinen saadessaan sen poistaa.[22]
U||Eräs valtakunnan komissioni teki vaikeutta Gandhille melkein kaikissa kohdin. V. 1914 eräs säädös peruutti intialaisilta kolmen punnan veron ja myönsi oleskeluvapauden Natalissa kaikille hinduille, jotka halusivat jäädä sinne vapaiksi työmiehiksi. Kahdenkymmenen vuoden uhrauksien jälkeen »Pois vastarinta» oli voittanut.

U||Gandhi palasi Intiaan nauttien johtajan arvovaltaa. Kansallisen riippumattomuuden liike oli siellä ollut kasvamassa jo vuosisadan alusta saakka. Kolmekymmentä vuotta sitä ennen eräät sivistyneet englantilaiset A. O. Hume ja Sir William Wedderburn (vapaamielisiä poliitikkoja) olivat perustaneet Intian Kansallis-Kongressin, jota he kauan säilyttivät luonteeltaan lojaalisena, koettaen sovittaa Intian etuja yhteen englantilaisten ylivallan kanssa. Japanin Venäjästä saama voitto herätti Aasiassa rotuylpeyden tunteen, ja lordi Curzonin yllytykset loukkasivat Intian isänmaanystäviä. Kongressin keskuudessa muodostui äärimmäisyyspuolue, jonka taistelukiihko saavutti vastakaikua maassa. Vanha perustuslaillinen puolue pysyi kuitenkin maailmansotaan saakka J. K. Gokhalen vaikutuksesta rehellisesti isänmaallisena, mutta samalla uskollisena Englannille; ja kansallinen tunne, joka tästälähin elähdytti Intian edustajain kokousta, johti heidät vaatimaan itsehallintoa (Svarâj), mistä käsitteeestä e
U||i ollut siihen saakka päästy yksimielisyyteen. Toiset mukautuivat yhteistyöhön englantilaisten kanssa, toiset halusivat karkoittaa Intiasta eurooppalaiset; toiset tahtoivat ottaa mallia Kanadasta ja Etelä-Afrikasta, toiset Japanista. Gandhi antoi ratkaisunsa, mikä oli vähemmän poliittinen kuin uskonnollinen ja pohjaltaan perinpohjaisempi kuin mitkään muut (Hind Swarâj). Häneltä puuttui, mitä tulee sen sovittamiseen käytännöllisiin tosiasioihin, ympäristönsä täsmällistä tuntemista; sillä vaikkakin hänellä pitkänä oleskeluaikanansa Etelä-Afrikassa oli ollut hyödyllistä kokemusta hindujen sielunelämästä ja ahimsân vastustamattomasta aseesta, oli hän ollut kaksikymmentä kolme vuotta kaukana maastaan. Hän malttoi mielensä ja tyytyi tekemään huomioita.[23]
U||Hän oli vielä niin kaukana vallankumousajatuksesta valtakuntaa vastaan, että hän maailmansodan puhjetessa v. 1914 lähti Englantiin siellä värvätäkseen ambulanssijoukon. »Hän uskoi rehellisesti (kirjoitti hän v. 1921) olevansa valtakunnan kansalainen.» Hän mainitsi sen v. 1920 monta kertaa kirjeissään kaikille Intian englantilaisille: »Rakkaat ystävät, ei kukaan englantilainen ole enemmän kuin minä pyrkinyt edistämään valtakunnan yhteyttä kahdenkymmenen yhdeksän vuoden julkisen toimintani aikana. Olen neljä kertaa asettanut elämäni vaaraan Englannin takia. … Vuoteen 1919 saakka olen puhunut yhteistyöstä vilpittömällä vakaumuksella…»
U||Hän ei ollut ainoa. Koko Intia oli v. 1914 joutunut »oikeussodan» ulkokullatun ihanteellisuuden lumoihin. Yllyttääkseen sitä apuun oli Englannin hallitus välkytellyt sille suuria tulevaisuudenlupauksia. Hartaasti toivottu homerule esitettiin yhtenä sellaisena. Elokuussa v. 1917 Intian asiain älykäs valtiosihteeri E.S. Montagu lupasi Intialle vastuunalaisen hallituksen; Intian kanssa käytiin neuvotteluihin, ja heinäkuussa v. 1918 varakuningas lordi Chelmsford allekirjoitti yhdessä Montagun kanssa julkisen esityksen perustuslain parantamiseksi.
U||Entente-armeijain vaara oli suuri vuoden 1918 ensimmäisinä kuukausina. Lloyd George oli huhtikuun 2 p:nä ulottanut asevelvolliskutsunnan Intiaankin, ja sotakonferenssi, joka kokoontui Delhissä saman kuun lopussa, julisti Intian riippumattomuuden olevan läheisen ajankysymyksen. Intia vastasi lähettämällä sotajoukkoja, ja Gandhi tarjosi vielä kerran Englannille lojaalista avustustaan. Intia varusti sotaan 950.000 miestä; se teki äärettömiä aineellisia uhrauksia. Ja se odotti luottamuksella uskollisuutensa palkitsemista.
U||Herääminen oli kauhea. Vuoden loppupuolella vaara oli ohi, mutta unohdettu oli myöskin muisto tehdyistä palveluksista. Kun aselepo oli päätetty, ei hallitus enää vaivautunut näyttelemään hyvän kaitselmuksen osaa. Kaukana siitä, että olisi suonut uusia vapauksia Intialle, se lakkautti entisetkin. Eräät uudet lait, »Rowlatt»-lait, jotka esitettiin Delhin keisarillisessa lakiasäätävässä neuvottelussa helmikuussa 1919, sisälsivät loukkaavaa epäluuloa tätä maata kohtaan, joka oli juuri antanut niin monta uskollisuuden osoitusta. Ne vakiinnuttivat Intian puolustuskin sodanaikaiset säädökset, palauttaen salaisen poliisin, ennakkosensuurin, — kaikki nämä todellisen piiritystilan hirmuvaltaiset toimenpiteet.
U||Petetty Intia hätkähti harmista. Kapina alkoi.[24] Gandhi järjesti sen.
U||Hän oli lujentanut asemansa edellisinä vuosina yhteiskunnallisilla parannuksilla, pyrkien parantamaan etenkin maanviljelystyöläisten olosuhteita. Ja kenenkään huomaamatta hän oli eräissä v. 1918 sattuneissa maanviljelysmellakoissa voitollisesti kokeillut hirveällä aseellaan, jota hän pian tuli käyttämään kansallisissa taisteluissa: tuolla intohimoisella »pois vastarinta»-opilla, joka oli hänestä lähtöisin ja jota myöhemmin tarkastelemme hänen sille antamalla nimellä Satyâgraha.
U||Mutta hän oli pysynyt vuoteen 1919 saakka ikäänkuin syrjässä intialaisesta kansallisliikkeestä, jonka edistyneimmät jäsenet rouva Annie Borantin v. 1916 yhdistäminä tunnustivat nyt johtajakseen suuren intialaisen Lokamanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakin. Tämä oli harvinaisen tarmokas mies, jossa yhdistyi sitkeäksi rautakimpuksi loistava järki, teräksinen tahdon voima ja ylhäinen luonne; jolla oli laajemmat aivot kuin Gandhilla ja vankemmasti vanhan aasialaisen sivistyksen ravitsemat; tiedemies, matemaatikko, oppinut; mies, joka oli uhrannut kaikki nerokkaat pyrkimykset isänmaansa palvelukseen ja oli Gandhin tavoin vapaa kaikesta henkilökohtaisesta kunnianhimosta; joka odotti vain asiansa voittoa vetäytyäkseen näyttämöltä ja ryhtyäkseen uudestaan tieteelliseen työhönsä. Niin kauan kuin hän eli, pysyi hän Intian tunnustettuna johtajana. Mitä olisi tapahtunutkaan elokuussa 1920, ellei ennenaikainen kuolema olisi häntä kohdannut? Gandhi, joka taipui hänen neronsa johdettavaksi, noudatti 
U||aivan toisenlaisia poliittisia toimintatapoja, ja epäilemättä hän olisi säilyttänyt, jos Tilak olisi elänyt, vain jonkinlaisen uskonnollisen johdon liikkeessä. Millainen olisikaan ollut Intian kansojen innostus tämän kaksinkertaisen johdon alla! Ei mikään olisi voinut sitä vastustaa, sillä Tilak oli toiminnan mestari, kuten Gandhi sisäisten voimien hallitsija. Kohtalo oli kuitenkin määrännyt toisin: ehkä vahingoksi Intialle ja Gandhille itselleen. Vähemmistön, siveellisen valiojoukon johtajan osa olisi paremmin vastannut hänen luonnettaan ja salaista mielitekoaan. Hän olisi jättänyt Tilakille mielellään enemmistön johdon. Hänellä ei ole koskaan ollut uskoa enemmistöön, kuten Tilakilla oli. Tämä toiminnan matemaatikko uskoi massoihin. Hän oli synnynnäinen demokraatti. Hän oli myöskin täydellä todella poliitikko eikä sellaisena välittänyt uskonnon vaatimuksista. Hän sanoi: »politiikka ei ollut sadhuja (pyhiä, hurskaita miehiä) varten». Tämä tiedemies olisi uhra
U||nnut, niin hän itse väitti, yksinpä totuudenkin maansa vapauden hyväksi. Ja tämä rehellinen kunnon mies, jonka elämä oli tahrattoman puhdas, ei epäillyt sanoa, että politiikassa kaikki on luvallista. Voi ajatella, että tällaisen luonteen ja Moskovan diktaattorin luonteen välillä olisi ajatustenvaihto ollut mahdollinen. Mutta Gandhin ajatus on siinä kohdassa muuttumaton.[25] Vaikkakin Tilakin ja Gandhin väliset keskustelut todistivat heidän henkilökohtaisesti syvästi kunnioittavan toisiaan, vahvistivat ne vain heidän menetelmiensä vastakkaisuuden, — toisin sanoen, rehellisinä miehinä he kumpikin toiminnassaan seurasivat tarkkaan ajatuksen viitoittamia teitä — heidän henkilöllisyyksiään ohjaavien imperatiivien vastakkaisuuden. Gandhi lausuu Tilakille suoraan, että velvoitettuna valitsemaan hän uhraisi mieluummin vapauden kuin totuuden. Ja vaikka hänellä onkin uskonnollista rakkautta maataan kohtaan, asettaa hän uskontonsa vielä korkeammalle kuin maansa.
U||»Olen avioliitossa Intian kanssa, olen sille velkaa kaiken. Minä uskon, että sillä on kutsumuksensa. Ellei, olisi tämä minulle koettelemuksen hetki, ja toivon, että sittenkin pysyisin horjumatonna. Minun uskonnollani ei ole maantieteellisiä rajoja. Jos uskoni on elävä, voittaa se rakkauteni Intiaankin.»[26]
U||Suuria sanoja, jotka antavat inhimillisen tarkoituksen taistelulle, jota nyt käymme kuvaamaan: sillä ne tekevät Intian apostolista maailman apostolin, kaikkien ihmisten kansalaistoverin.[27] Meidän kaikkien on otettava osaa taisteluun, jonka Mahatma neljä vuotta sitten aloitti.
U||* * * * *
U||On pantava merkille, että hän yksinpä silloinkin, kun ottaa johtaakseen taistelua Rowlatt-lakia vastaan, tekee sen »vieroittaakseen tämän liikkeen pois väkivallan tieltä.»[28] Sillä kapina kuitenkin kaikitenkin tulee ja sitä on ohjattava. Jotta voisi hyvin ymmärtää, mitä nyt seuraa, on muistettava, että Gandhin ajatus toimii kahdessa kerroksessa: alempana ovat hyvin vanhat uskonnolliset perustukset ja niiden yläpuolella yhteiskunnallinen toiminta, jonka hän rakentaa näille näkymättömille maanalaisille perustoille, sovittaen sen todellisiin mahdollisuuksiin ja maansa toivomuksiin. Hän on uskonnollinen luonnostaan, poliitikko välttämättömyyden pakosta. Sitä mukaa kuin tapausten paino ja kansan muiden johtajien poistuminen pakottavat häntä ottamaan tehtäväkseen laivan ohjaamisen myrskyssä, vakiintuu hänen toimintansa poliittinen ja käytännöllinen luonne.
U||Mutta rakennuksen pääosana pysyy aina maan-alainen perustus: se on laaja ja syvä ja tehty kantamaan aivan toisenlaista temppeliä kuin pakosta hätäisesti kyhättyä; se yksin on pysyvä, kaikki muu on väliaikaista ja määrätty siirryntävuosien käyttöön. On siis tärkeätä tuntea tämä maanalainen kirkko, jossa Gandhin ajatus on saanut vankan asuinsijansa. Sinne hän pakenee joka päivä saadakseen toimeensa uusia voimia ylhäältä.
U||Gandhi uskoo hartaasti kansansa uskontoon, hindulaisuuteen; mutta ei tiedemiehen tavoin kirjaimeen kiintyneenä; ei myöskään arvostelukyvyttömänä uskonnollisena kiihkoilijana, jollainen sokeasti hyväksyy kaikki vanhat traditiot. Hänen uskonnollaan on kaksinkertainen valvonta: omatunto ja järki.
U||»Minä en tee uskonnosta itselleni epäjumalaa enkä salli mitään sen nimeen pyhitettyä pahaa.[29] Minulla ei ole mitään halua vetää yhtäkään olentoa mukaani, ellen voi vedota hänen järkeensä. Minä hylkään vanhimpien sâstrojen jumalallisuuden, elleivät ne vakuuta järkeäni…»[30]
U||Toiselta puolen — ja tämä on pääkohta — hän ei tunnusta eikä tahdo väittää hindulaisuuden olevan ainoa autuaaksitekevä uskonoppi.
U||»En usko Vedojen yksinomaiseen jumaluuteen. Uskon että Biblia, Koraani ja Zend-Avesta ovat yhtä jumalaisesti innoitetut kuin Vedat… Hinduismi ei ole lähetyssaarnaaja. Siinä on tilaa kaikkien maailman profeettojen ihailulle… Se sanoo jokaiselle, että on ihailtava Jumalaa uskonsa tai Dharmansa mukaan; ja siten se elää rauhassa kaikkien uskontojen kanssa.»[31]
U||Hän ei ole näkemättä erehdyksiä tai virheitä, jotka vuosisatain kuluessa ovat tunkeutuneet hindulaisuuteen, ja hän ruoskii niitä. Mutta:
U||…. En voi ruveta enempää erittelemään tunnettani hindulaisuutta kohtaan kuin rakkauttani omaan vaimoonikaan. Hän liikuttaa mieltäni enemmän kuin kukaan muu nainen maailmassa. Ei siksi, että hän olisi virheetön: uskallan sanoa hänellä olevan virheitä paljonkin enemmän kuin mitä minä näen; mutta minulla on tunne siteen katkaisemattomuudesta. Samaa voin sanoa hindulaisuudesta kaikkine sen vikoineen ja rajoituksineen. Ei mikään minua hurmaa niin kuin Gitân ja Râmâyanan musiikki, ne kaksi ainoata hindulaisuuden kirjaa, jotka voin väittää tuntevani…. Minä tunnen todelliset viat, jotka tahraavat suuria hindulaisia pyhättöjä; mutta minä rakastan niitä siitä huolimatta… Niin täydellinen uudistaja kuin olenkin, en sentään hylkää ainoatakaan hindulaisuuden olennaista ajatusta»[32]
U||Mitkä sitten ovat ne päätotuudet, joihin hän on kiintynyt? Hän luettelee ne nimenomaan eräässä kirjoitelmassaan lokakuun 6 p:ltä 1921, joka on hänen julkinen uskontunnustuksensa:
U||»1. Uskon Vedoihin, Upanišadeihin, Puranoihin ja kaikkeen, mikä sisältyy käsitteeseen: hindujen pyhät kirjat, ja niinmuodoin uskon Avatâreihin ja uudestisyntymiseen;
U||»2. Uskon Varnâšrama Dharmaan (kastijärjestykseen),[33] mutta ankarasti vedalaisessa mielessä, eikä nykyisessä, kansantajuisessa ja karkeassa;
U||3, Uskon lehmän suojelevaan voimaan kansantajuista paljon laveammassa mielessä;
U||4. En kiellä epäjumalien palvontaa.»
U||Jokainen eurooppalainen pysähtyy vetämään henkeään lukiessaan näitä uskontunnustuksen rivejä, joista kuvastuva sisäinen ajatus on niin perin erilainen kuin meidän, niin ankarasti suljettu uskonnollisten ja siveellisten oppien kuoreen, niin kaukainen ajan ja paikan suhteen, vailla kaikkea yhteistä mittaa meidän henkemme kanssa, että on turha pyrkiä niitä oikein ymmärtämään. Jatkakoon hän kuitenkin! Hän löytää hieman tuonnempana seuraavaa, mikä on hänelle tutumpaa:
U||»Minä uskon hindulaisten sananlaskuun, ettei kukaan oikein tunne sâstroja, ellei hän ole saavuttanut täydellisyyttä viattomuudessa (Ahimsâ), totuudessa (Satya) ja itsensähillinnässä (Brahmacharya) ja kieltäytynyt kaikesta rikkauden pyyteestä ja omistuksesta.»
U||Tässä hindun puhe yhtyy evankeliumin sanoihin. Ja Gandhi tunsi tämän sukulaisuuden. Hänen Ethical Religion'insa loppuu Kristuksen sanojen toistamisella.[34] Englantilaisen papin kysyessä häneltä v. 1920, mistä kirjasta hän oli saanut suurimman vaikutuksen, hän mainitsi ensimmäiseksi Uuden Testamentin.[35] Oman tunnustuksensa mukaan[36] oli hänen ennen kaikkea kiittäminen Vuorisaarnaa, josta hän v. 1893 tapasi passiivisen vastarinnan olemuksen. Hänen haastattelijansa kysyy häneltä hämmästyneenä:
U||»— Ettekö olleet sitä jo ennen tavanneet hindulaisten kirjoja lukiessanne?»
U||— En, väittää Gandhi. Minä tunsin aikaisemmin Bhagavad Gîtân ja ihailin sitä. Mutta Uusi Testamentti minut herätti tuntemaan passiivisen vastarinnan arvon. Minä olin ylenmäärin iloinen sitä lukiessani. Bhagavad Gîtâ vahvisti tätä vaikutelmaa; ja Tolstoin 'Taivaan valtakunta on teidän keskellänne' antoi sille kestävän muodon.»
U||Ei saa todella unohtaa, että tämä aasialainen uskovainen on Toistoilta[37] saanut ravintoa, että hän on kääntänyt Ruskinin ja Platonin teoksia, että hän nojautuu Thoreauhon, ihailee Mazzinia, lukee Edward Carpenteria ja että hänen ajatustapansa on eurooppalaisten ja amerikalaisten ajatusten läpitunkema. Eurooppalaisen ei tarvitse vieroa hänen käsitystapaansa, jos hän vain haluaa vaivautua sitä lähestymään. Silloin hän tulee tuntemaan näiden uskontunnustuksen pykäläin syvän tarkoituksen — pykäläin, joiden kirjaimellinen muoto häntä oudostuttaa. Kaksi asiaa ennen kaikkea näyttää muodostavan ylipääsemättömän muurin Intian ja Euroopan uskonnollisen hengen välille: lehmän palvonta ja kastijärjestelmä. Mutta katsokaamme, mitä ne merkitsevät Gandhin käsityksen mukaan:
U||On totta, etteivät ne ole hänelle toisarvoisia kohtia uskonopin kokonaisuudessa. Lehmän pyhittäminen on luonteenomaista hindulaisuudelle. Gandhi näkee siinä suorastaan inhimillisen kehityksen korkeimman ilmenemismuodon. Miksi? Koska lehmä on »koko ihmisen alapuolella olevan maailman» symbooli, jonka kanssa ihminen tekee sovintoliiton. Se merkitsee »veljeyttä ihmisen ja eläimen välillä». Ja hänen kauniiden sanojensa mukaan »se vie ihmisolennon ulkopuolelle oman lajinsa rajojen. Se toteuttaa ihmisen yhteenkuuluvaisuuden kaiken elävän kanssa.» Syynä siihen, miksi juuri lehmä on valittu ennen muita olentoja, on se tosiasia, että se on Intiassa ihmisen paras toveri, hyvinvoinnin lähde, ja Gandhi näkee »tässä lempeässä luontokappaleessa oikean sääliväisyyden runoelman.» Mutta sen palvonnassa hän ei näe mitään epäjumalanpalvelusta, eikä kukaan tuomitse jyrkemmin kuin hän Intian tylyä, suvaitsematonta kuvainkumartamista, joka seuraa vain kirjainta eikä tunne sääliä »Jum
U||alan mykkiä luontokappaleita kohtaan». Ken tämän säälin on käsittänyt (ja kukapa sen olisi paremmin käsittänyt kuin Assisin Fransiskus!) — hän ei voi ihmetellä, miksi Gandhi pitää sitä niin tärkeänä. Hän ei ole väärässä sanoessaan, että lehmän pyhittäminen siinä mielessä, minkä Gandhi sille antaa, »on hindulaisuuden lahja maailmalle.» Sillä evankeliumin käskyyn: Rakasta lähimmäistäsi niinkuin itseäsi, hän lisää: Kaikki elävät olennot ovat lähimmäistäsi.
U||Kastijärjestelmää on eurooppalaisen järjen ehkä vielä vaikeampi hyväksyä — (ainakin nykypäiväin Euroopan: sillä Jumala tietää, mitä meidän on tulevaisuudessa odotettava kehitykseltä, joka on demokraattinen enää vain nimeltään!) — En tahdo kuvitellakaan osaavani esittää Gandhin käsitystapaa niin, että saisin hänet tunnustetuksi, eikä minulla ole siihen haluakaan. Mutta selostukset todistavat ilmeisesti, ettei mikään ylpeyden tai yhteiskunnallisen ylemmyyden aate ole tämän uskon elävöittäjänä, vaan aate, että jokaisen on omassa yhteiskunnallisessa asemassaan täytettävä velvollisuutensa.
U||»Minä olen taipuvainen uskomaan», sanoo Gandhi, »että perinnöllisyyden laki on ikuinen ja että jokainen yritys muuttaa sitä vie täydelliseen sekasortoon… Varnâšrama on juurtunut ihmisluontoon, ja hindulaisuus on vain tehnyt sen tieteeksi…»
U||Mutta hän rajoittaa luokat vain neljään: Bramaanit (älyllinen ja papillinen luokka), Kšatrijat (sotilaallinen ja hallinnollinen), Vaišyat (kaupallinen luokka) ja Šudrat (työläiset, käsityöläiset). Eikä hän myönnä näiden välillä mitään ylemmyyden tai alemmuuden suhdetta. Ne ovat eri kutsumuksia: ei mitään muuta. Velvollisuuksia: ei mitään etuoikeuksia.[38]
U||»On vastoin hindulaisen luonnetta, että ihminen ylimalkaan määrää toiset korkeampiin, toiset alempiin luokkiin. Kaikki ovat syntyneet palvelemaan Jumalan luomakuntaa, bramaanit tiedollaan, kšatriyat suojelevalla voimallaan, vaišyat kaupallisella tiedollaan, šudrat ruumiillisella työllään. Tämä ei merkitse sitä, että bramaani olisi vapautettu ruumiillisesta työstä, vaan sitä, että hän on saanut paremmat tietämisen lahjat; eikä sitä, ettei šudra voisi saavuttaa mahdollista tietoa, vaan että hän palvelee paremmin ruumiillaan ja ettei hänen näin ollen ole tarvis kadehtia toisten toimia. Bramaani, joka vetoaisi ylemmyyteensä tietojensa perusteella, olisi tällä teolla langennut luokastaan, eikä hänellä silloin olisi oikeata tietoa… Varnâšramalla on olemisen oikeutuksena yhteiskunnallisen tarmon hyvä jaoitus ja tahdon aikaansaama terveellinen itsepakko…»
U||Kastijako perustuu siis kieltäymykseen eikä etuoikeuteen. Emme saa muuten unhottaa, että sielunvaellus-uskon mukaan luonto palautuu tasapainoon toisiaan seuraavien olemassaolojen aikana, tehden bramanista šudran ja päinvastoin.
U||Parioilla (»koskettamattomilla» eli hyljeksityillä yksilöillä) ei ole mitään yhteyttä näiden neljän erilaisen, mutta keskenään yhdenarvoisen kastin kanssa. Me tulemme näkemään, kuinka palavan intohimoisesti Gandhi lakkaamatta taistelee yhteiskunnallista vääryyttä vastaan: ja tämä on hänen apostoliutensa liikuttavin puoli. Hänestä paria-kysymys on hindulaisuuden häpeä, oikean opin epämuodostuma, tahra, ja hän kärsii siitä sietämättömästi:
U||»Mieluummin näkisin itseni kappaleiksi silvottuna», hän kirjoittaa, »kuin olisin tunnustamatta poljettujen luokkien jäseniä veljikseni… En halua uudestisyntyä; mutta jos se tapahtuu, niin tahtoisin syntyä pariain joukkoon jakaakseni heidän häpeänsä ja tehdäkseni työtä heidän vapauttamisekseen…»
U||Hän otti omakseen pienen »koskettamattoman» ja puhuu hellästi tästä suloisesta seitsenvuotisesta rajupäästä, joka oli hänen kotinsa sateena ja päivänpaisteena.
U||Olen jo sanonut kylliksi näyttääkseni hindulaisen uskontunnustuksen verhon alta suuren evankelisen sydämen. Lempeämmän, sovittelevamman kuin Tolstoin ja — jos niin uskallan sanoa — laajakäsitteisessä mielessä luontaisemmin »kristityn»: sillä Tolstoi on sitä vähemmin luonnosta kuin halusta.
U||Se asia, jossa näiden kahden miehen samankaltaisuus näkyy, jossa Tolstoin vaikutus Gandhiin ehkä on ollut suurin, on jälkimmäisen tuomitseva kanta Euroopan sivistykseen nähden. Rousseausta saakka sivistystä ovat tuominneet yhtämittaa Euroopan vapaimmat henget, ja uudestaherännyt Aasia sai vain ammentaa heidän valituskirjoistaan muodostaakseen hirveän asiakirjakokoelman valloittajiaan vastaan. Gandhi ei ole tässä asiassa mitään laiminlyönyt, ja Hind Swarâj luettelee nämä syytöskirjat, joiden joukossa on suuri määrä englantilaisten kirjoittamia. Mutta aivan kiistaton on se kirja, jonka Euroopan sivistys itse on kirjoittanut sorrettujen, riistettyjen, solvaistujen heimojen vereen valheellisten periaatteiden nimessä; ja sellainen kirja on etenkin ollut räikeä herääminen kaikesta siitä valheesta, siitä ahneudesta ja raakuudesta, jonka viime sota, n.s. »sivistyssota» levitti silmäin eteen kaikessa inhoittavuudessaan. Niin suuri oli Euroopan henkinen sokeus, että se kutsui Aasian j
U||a Afrikan kansat näkemään koko sen alastomuutta. Ne ovat sen nähneet ja tuominneet.
U||»Äskeinen sota on näyttänyt nykypäiväin Eurooppaa hallitsevan sivistyksen saatanallisuuden. Voittajat ovat rikkoneet julkisen moraalin kaikki lait muka hyveen nimessä. Ei mitään valhetta ole pidetty käytäntöön kelpaamattomana. Kaikkien rikosten aihe on törkeän aineellinen … Eurooppa ei ole kristitty. Se jumaloi Mammonaa…»
U||Löydätte tällaisia ajatuksia lausuttuina parikymmentä kertaa viiden vuoden kuluessa sekä Intiassa että Japanissa. Nekin, jotka ovat liian varovaisia sanomaan näin ääneensä, ovat tämän vakaumuksen omistaneet ajatuksissaan. Se ei ole vuoden 1918 Pyrrhuksen-voiton vähimmin turmiollinen seuraus. Mutta Gandhi ei ollut odottanut vuotta 1914 nähdäkseen sivistyksen oikeat kasvot: nämä olivat hänelle näyttäytyneet verhottomina jo noina kahtenakymmenenä Etelä-Afrikassa vietettynä vuotena. Ja Hind Swarâjissaan vuodelta 1908 hän julistaa uudenaikaisen sivistyksen »suureksi paheeksi.»
U||Sivistys, sanoo Gandhi, on sitä vain nimeltä. Se on erään hindulaisen sanontatavan mukaan »musta aikakausi, pimeyden kausi». Se tekee aineellisesta hyvästä elämän ainoan päämäärän. Se ei välitä yhtään sielun parhaasta. Se lumoo eurooppalaisia, alistaa ne rahan orjiksi, tekee ne mahdottomiksi rauhaan, jopa sisäiseen elämäänkin; se on helvetti heikoille ja työtätekeville; se uuvuttaa kansojen elinvoiman. Tämä saatanallinen sivistys tuhoo itse itsensä. Se on todellisempi Intian vihollinen kuin englantilaiset, jotka kukin eriksensä eivät ole pahoja, vaan sairaita sivistyksensä takia. Gandhi vastustaa myöskin niitä kansalaisiaan, jotka tahtoisivat karkoittaa englantilaiset tehdäkseen Intiasta »sivistysvaltion» Euroopan malliin. Se olisi, hän sanoo, »tiikerin luontoa ilman tiikeriä». Ei, »ainoa suuri, todella välttämätön toimenpide on karkoittaa länsimaiden sivistys».
U||Kolmea ihmisluokkaa vastaan Gandhi nousee erikoisen tuimasti taistelemaan: ne ovat hallintoviranomaiset, lääkärit ja opettajat.
U||Näiden viimemainittujen vierominen on selitettävissä, koska he ovat saaneet intialaiset unohtamaan oman kielensä ja omat ajatuksensa; he johdattavat lapset kansalliseen alennukseen. He vetoavat vain ymmärrykseen; he eivät tunne sydäntä; he laiminlyövät luonteen oikean kehityksen. Vieläpä he halveksivat käsityötäkin, vaikka on todellinen rikos opettaa yksinomaan kirjatietoa kansakunnalle, josta 80 % on maanviljelijöitä ja 10 % teollisuusväkeä. — Hallintoviranomaisten vaikutus on epäsiveellistä. Oikeusistuimet Intiassa ovat brittiläisten vallan välikappaleita; ne lietsovat eripuraisuutta intialaisten keskuuteen ja tunnettuun tapaan ylläpitävät ja kartuttavat kaikissa maan äärissä väittelyitä ja riitoja. Se on ihmisten huonojen vaistojen tosin taloudellisesti tuottoisaa, mutta kehnoa hyväksikäyttämistä. — Mitä taas tulee lääkäreihin, myöntää Gandhi, että hänen mieltänsä heidän ammattinsa ensin kiinnitti; mutta pian hän huomasi, etteivät he olleet kunniallisia
U||. Lännen lääketiede huolehtii ainoastaan sairaiden ruumiillisten kipujen huojennuksesta eikä ollenkaan pyri hävittämään sairauden syitä, joina ovat suurimmalta osalta paheet; voipa vielä väittää, että se auttaa paheita rehoittamaan opettamalla paheellisille ihmisille keinoja, joiden avulla nämä voivat nauttia haluistaan niin vaarattomasti kuin suinkin. Se siis myötävaikuttaa kansan siveelliseen turmeltumiseen, se veltostuttaa ihmiset »mustan noituuden»[39] resepteillä, jotka vieroittavat heidät pois ruumiin ja hengen sankarillisesta kurista. Tälle väärälle länsimaiselle lääketieteelle, jota Gandhi on usein kohtuuttomastikin solvaissut, hän panee vastakohdaksi todellisen tauteja ehkäisevän lääketieteen, jolle hän on omistanut erään pienistä kansantajuisista tutkielmistaan nimeltä Terveyden opas, joka on kahdenkymmenen vuoden kokemusten hedelmä. Se on yhtä paljon siveydellisyyden kuin taudinhoito-opin tutkielma, sillä »sairaus ei ole ainoastaan töittemme, vaan myösk
U||in ajatustemme tulosta»; ja suhteellisesti yksinkertaista on määrätä säännöt pahan ehkäisemiseksi, sillä »kaikilla taudeilla on sama alkujuuri, se näet, ettemme seuraa terveyden luonnollisia lakeja. Ruumis on Jumalan asuinsija. Se tulee pitää puhtaana». Gandhin määräyksissä on muuten (vaikkakin ne liian itsepäisesti kieltävät koetettujen lääkkeiden hyödyn) paljon tervettä järkeä, mutta samalla äärimmäisen ankaria siveysopillisia vaatimuksia.[40]
U||Mutta uudenaikaisen sivistyksen sydän (rauta-aika: rautasydän) on kone. Se on hirveä epäjumala. Se meidän täytyy hylätä. Gandhin palava halu on hävittää Intiasta uudenaikainen koneistus. Hän pitää englantilaisten markkinainkin vallanalaista Intiaa parempana kuin vapaata, mutta englantilaisen koneteollisuuden perinyttä Intiaa.
U||»Parempi on ostaa Manchesterin kankaita Intiassa kuin perustaa Intiaan Manchesterin tehtaita. Intialainen Rockefeller ei ole suurempiarvoinen kuin alkuperäinen amerikkalainen. Koneistus on suuri synti, se orjuuttaa kansat… Ja raha on myrkkyä, kuten sukupuolirikollisuuskin…»
U||Mutta, kysyvät uudenaikaista ajatustapaa kannattavat intialaiset, mitä tulisi Intiasta ilman rautateitä ja raitioteitä ja suurta teollisuuselämää? »Elihän Intia ennenkin», vastaa Gandhi. »Vuosituhansia on Intia pysynyt järkähtämättömänä, yksin, keskellä valtakuntien vaihtuvaa aallokkoa. Kaikki muut ovat hävinneet. Se on saavuttanut jo vuosituhansia sitten itsehillintäkyvyn ja löytänyt tien onneen. Sillä ei ole tässä suhteessa mitään oppimista muilta. Se ei ole halunnut koneita eikä suuria kaupunkeja. Antiikkinen aura, rukki, vanha omaperäinen nuorisonkasvatus ovat lujittaneet sen viisauden ja sen hyvinvoinnin. Meidän täytyy palata takaisin vanhanaikaiseen yksinkertaisuuteen, tietenkään ei yhdellä harppauksella, vaan vähitellen, kärsivällisesti, jokainen näyttäen toiselleen esimerkkiä…»
U||Tämä on ajatuksen pohja; ja se on paljosisältöinen. Se edellyttää edistyksen kieltämistä, melkeinpä eurooppalaisen tieteen kieltämistä.[41] Tämä keskiaikainen usko rohkenee siis syöksyä ihmishengen ikuista tulivuoren purkausta vastaan ja tulia pirstotuksi. Mutta ensinnäkin on ehkä varminta sanoa, ei »ihmishengen», vaan »eräänlaisen ihmishengen», sillä jos voi uskoa — (ja minä uskon) — maailmankaikkeuden hengen sinfoniseen yhtenäisyyteen, niin sen täytyy olla tehty monista eri äänistä, joilla jokaisella on aina tehtävänsä; ja meidän nuori Läntemme ei sen rytmin tempaamana kyllin ajattele sitä, ettei se aina ole johtanut sinfoniaa, että sen edistyksen laki on häviämisen, vastakkaisten liikkeiden ja uudesti kehkeytymisen alainen, että ihmiskunnan sivistyshistoria on täsmällisemmin sanottuna sivistysten historiaa, ja jos jokaisessa sivistyksessä toteaa edistystä (vaihtuvaa, kaoottista, rikkoutunutta, joskus seisahtunutta), ei voi kuitenkaan vakuuttaa, että kehitys
U|| käy toisesta suuresta sivistyksestä toiseen.
U||Mutta väittelemättä tässä edistyksen eurooppalaisuudesta voimme yksinkertaisesti todeta, että Intian koko nykyinen liike käy vastoin Gandhin hartainta tahtoa. Ei saa kuitenkaan luulla Gandhin uskon siihen sortuvan. Tällainen luulo todistaisi huonoa orientaalisen hengen tuntemista. Gobineau sanoo: »Aasialaiset ovat kaikissa asioissa paljon itsenäisemmät kuin me. He odottavat vaikka vuosisatoja, kun on pakko, eikä heidän ajatuksensa niinkään pitkän horroksen jälkeen ole milloinkaan menettänyt tuoreuttaan enempää kuin voimaansakaan». Vuosisadat eivät ole omiaan peloittamaan hindua. Gandhi on valmis ottamaan vastaan menestyksen vuoden kuluessa. Mutta hän on yhtä valmis odottamaan sitä muutamia vuosisatoja. Hän ei pakota aikaa väkivalloin. Ja ajan myöhästyessä hän myöhästyy sen mukana. Milloin hän toiminnassaan huomaa Intian riittämättömästi valmistuneeksi ymmärtämään ja käytäntöön asettamaan hänen sille suunnittelemia perinpohjaisia parannuksia, hän osaa pysyttää
U|| toimintansa mahdollisuuksien rajojen sisällä. Eikä hämmästytä ollenkaan, kun kuulee tämän »koneellisuuden» leppymättömän vihollisen sanovan v. 1921:
U||»En itkisi koneiden häviämistä; mutta minulla ei ole tällä haavaa keinoa niiden poistamiseksi.»
U||Taikka:
U||»Täydellisen rakkauden laki (poikkeukseton ja tinkimätön) on olemukseni perus. Mutta minä en saarnaa tätä lopullista lakia poliittisin keinoin… Tämä olisi itsensä edeltäpäin tappioon tuomitsemista. Ei olisi järkevää odottaa joukoilta nykyään tämän lain tottelemista. En ole hourailija, minä väitän olevani käytännöllinen idealisti.»
U||Määritelmä on täsmällinen: hän ei pyydä koskaan ihmisiltä muuta kuin minkä he voivat antaa. Ja tämä ei suinkaan ole vähän, kun on kysymyksessä sellainen kansa kuin Intian. Hirvittävä kansa lukumäärältänsä,[42] kestävyyteensä ja sielunsa syvyyksiin nähden. Tämän kansan ja Gandhin välille on muodostunut heti ensimmäisestä kosketuksesta sopusointu, he ymmärtävät toisensa puhumatta; Gandhi tietää mitä hän siltä voi odottaa, ja tämä kansa odottaa mitä Gandhi siltä milloinkin vaatii.
U||Näiden kahden välillä vallitsee ensinnäkin sopimus: Swarâj,[43]
U||Intian Home Rule.
U||»Minä tiedän», kirjoittaa Gandhi, »että Swarâj on kansakunnan päämäärä, eikä »Pois väkivalta» -aate…»
U||Ja meneepä hän niinkin pitkälle, että lisää nämä hänen lausumikseen hämmästyttävät sanat:
U||»Mieluummin näkisin Intian vapaana väkivallankin avulla kuin valtiaiden väkivalloin kahlehtimana orjana.»
U||»Mutta», hän oikaisee heti, »tämä merkitsee mahdottomuuden edellyttämistä: sillä väkivalta ei voi vapauttaa Intiaa; Swarâjia ei voida saavuttaa ilman sielun voimia, jotka ovat Intian todellinen ase, rakkauden ase, totuuden voima—, Satyâgraha.[44] Ja Gandhin nerous piilee juuri siinä, että hän kaikkea tätä kansalleen saarnatessaan pyrkii kansasta ilmisaamaan sekä sen oikean luonteen että kätketyn voiman.
U||Satyâgraha -nimityksen on Gandhi keksinyt Etelä-Afrikassa erottaakseen oman toimintansa passiivisesta vastarinnasta. On pyrittävä mitä tarkimmin säilyttämään selvänä tämä ero: sillä eurooppalaiset pitävät Gandhin liikettä juuri »passiivisena vastarintana» (taikka »pois vastarinta» -liikkeenä). Tämä ajatus on väärä.
U||Ei kellään ihmisellä maailmassa ole suurempaa vastenmielisyyttä passiivisuutta kohtaan kuin tällä väsymättömällä taistelijalla, joka on »vastustuksen» sankarillisimpia edustajia. Hänen liikkeensä ydin on rakkauden lietsoma, uskon ja uhrautuvaisuuden tukema aktiivinen vastarinta. Ja tätä kolminkertaista voimaa ilmaisee sana Satyâgraha.
U||Kunpa ei vain joku raukka etsisi pelkuruudelleen turvaa Gandhin tapaisen henkilön varjossa! Gandhi karkoittaa sen seurakunnastaan. Suurempiarvoinen on sittenkin väkivaltainen kuin raukka!
U||»Missä on valittava vain pelkuruuden ja väkivallan väillä, minä neuvoisin turvautumaan väkivaltaan…
U||Minä harrastan rauhallista rohkeutta kuolla tappamatta. Mutta kellä ei ole tätä rohkeutta, minä toivon hänen viljelevän mieluummin tappamisen ja tapetuksi tulemisen taitoa kuin että asianomainen pakenee häpeällisesti vaaraa. Sillä se, joka pakenee, tekee ajatuksissa väkivaltaa: hän pakenee, koska hänellä ei ole rohkeutta tulla tapetuksi tappaessa… Minä uskaltaisin tuhat kertaa ennemmin valita väkivallan kuin koko heimon veltostumisen… Paljon mieluummin näen minä Intian turvautuvan aseisiin puolustaakseen kunniataan kuin jäävän raukkamaisesti oman häpeänsä todistajaksi…»[45]
U||»Mutta», hän lisää, »minä tiedän, että »Pois väkivalta» on rajattomasti väkevämpi väkivaltaa, että anteeksianto on miehekkäämpää kuin rangaistus. Anteeksianto on sotamiehen kaunistus. Mutta rankaisemasta pidättäytyminen on anteeksiantoa vain silloin, kun on olemassa mahdollisuus rankaisemiseen. Sillä ei ole mitään merkitystä, jos rankaisija on voimaton… En usko Intian olevan voimattoman. Satatuhatta englantilaista ei voi säikähdyttää kolmeasataa miljoonaa ihmisolentoa… Muutoinkaan ei voima riipu fyysillisistä kyvyistä, se asustaa järkähtämättömässä tahdossa… »Pois väkivalta»-aate ei ole omatahtoista alistumista pahantekijän mielivaltaan. »Pois väkivalta» -aate asettaa kaiken sielun voiman tyrannin tahtoa vastaan. Yksi ainut mies voi täten uhmata koko valtakuntaa ja edistää sen häviötä…»
U||Mutta millä hinnalla? Kärsimyksensä hinnalla. Kärsimys, siinä suuri laki…
U||»Ihmisluokan tuntomerkki… Olemuksen välttämätön ehto. Elämä kasvaa kuolemasta. Jotta vilja kasvaisi, täytyy siemenen hävitä. Ei ole kukaan koskaan noussut muutoin kuin käymällä läpi kärsimyksen tulen… Ei kukaan voi siltä säilyä… Edistys on olemassa vain puhdistaakseen kärsimystä, välttäen itse aikaansaamasta kärsimystä… Mitä puhtaampi on omakohtainen kärsimys, sitä suurempi edistys… »Pois väkivalta» on tietoista kärsimystä… Olen rohjennut esittää Intialle antiikkista uhrautumisen lakia, kärsimyksen lakia. Rišit, jotka keksivät »Pois väkivalta» -lain keskellä pahimpia väkivaltaisuuksia, olivat suurempia kuin Newton, suurempia sotilaita kuin Wellington: he ovat toteuttaneet aseiden tarpeettomuuden… »Pois väkivalta» -uskonto ei ole ainoastaan pyhiä varten, se on ihmisten enemmistöä varten. Se on meikäläisten laki, kuten väkivalta on raakalaisten. Raakalaisessa nukkuu henki. Ihmisen arvokkuus kaipaa korkeampaa lakia: hengen voimaa… Tahdon Intian 
U||turvautuvan tähän lakiin, tahdon, että se on tietoinen voimastaan. Sillä on sielu, joka ei voi hävitä. Tämä sielu voi uhmata maailman kaikkia aineellisia voimia.»
U||Suuri ylpeys. Hänen ylpeä rakkautensa Intiaan vaatii hänet hylkäämään ilkeän väkivaltaisuuden ja uhraamaan itsensä. »Pois väkivalta» on hänen aatelis-arvonimensä. Jos juuri tämä kohta pettää, on se arvo hävitetty. Eikä Gandhi voi kestää tällaista ajatusta:
U||»Jos Intia tekisi väkivaltaisuudesta lain, en välittäisi elää Intiassa; se maa lakkaisi minussa herättämästä mitään ylpeyttä. Minun isänmaanrakkauteni on uskontoni alainen, minä takerrun kiinni Intiaan, kuten lapsi äidin rintaan, koska tunnen sen minulle antavan tarvitsemaani henkistä ruokaa. Tämän ruoan puutteessa tulisin olemaan kuin orpo… Minä vetäytyisin Himalayan yksinäisyyteen siellä löytääkseni suojaa vertavuotavalle sielulleni.»
U||* * * * *
U||Mutta hän ei ollenkaan epäile, hän uskoo Intiaan; ja hän tekee helmikuussa 1919 päätöksen aloittaa Satyâgraha -sotaretkensä — ase, jonka voimaa hän oli kokeillut vuoden 1918 maanviljelysliikkeissä.
U||Poliittisen vallankumouksen luonne oli siitä kaukana. Gandhi on vielä lojalisti. Hän pysyy sellaisena niin kauan kuin hänellä on toivon pilkekin Englannin lojaalisuudesta. Tammikuussa 1920 hän puolustaa — ja Intian kansallismieliset tulevat häntä siitä katkerasti moittimaan[46] — periaatteessa yhteistoimintaa valtakunnan kanssa. Rehellisenä miehenä hän uskoo sen onnistumiseen. Tänä Intian hallitukseen kohdistetun vastarinnan ensimmäisenä vuonna hän voi vakuuttaa kaikella vilpittömyydellä lordi Hunterille näkevänsä Satyâgrahan kannattajissa hallituksen parhaita perustuslaillisia alamaisia. Intian hallitus on tyhmän itsepäinen, jos se pakottaa Intian siveellisen oppaan repimään lojaalisuuden välikirjan, johon Gandhi uskoo olevansa sidottu.
U||Täten esiintyy Satyâgraha alussa perustuslaillisena vastarintana, joka kunnioittavasti kehoittaa hallitusta. Hallitus on säätänyt väärän lain. »Satyâgrahit», jotka tavallisissa oloissa taipuvat lakien edessä, niskoittelevat tahallansa häpäisevää lakia vastaan; ja jos ei tämä riitä oikeutta aikaansaamaan, he pidättävät itselleen vapauden ulottaa niskoittelemisensa muihinkin lakeihin, vieläpä kieltäytyä täydellisesti yhteistoiminnastaan valtion kanssa. Mutta kuinka erilainen onkaan luonteeltaan niskoitteleminen kuin kaikki se, mitä Lännessä tällä sanalla ymmärretään! Mikä uskonnollisen sankaruuden eriskummallinen vivahdus!
U||Koska Satyâgrahien ei ole lupa väkivaltaisesti toimia vastustajaa kohtaan — täytyy näet olettaa, että vastustajakin on vilpitön: mikä toisen mielestä näyttää totuudelta, voi toisesta näyttää erehdykseltä; eikä väkivalta voita koskaan[47] — täytyy heidän voittaa vastustaja heidän vakaumuksestaan säteilevällä rakkaudella, kieltäymyksellä, vapaasti, iloisesti kannetuilla kärsimyksillä.[48] Se on vastustamatonta propagandaa. Sitä tietä Kristuksen ja hänen pienen laumansa risti on voittanut itselleen valtakunnan.
U||Saattaakseen päivänvaloon tämän kansan uskonnollisen pyrkimyksen, kansan, joka tarjoutuu uhrautumaan ikuisten aarteiden, oikeuden ja vapauden takia, Mahatma aloitti liikkeen, määräten huhtikuun 6:nnen päivän 1919 koko Intian rukous- ja paastopäiväksi, Hartaliksi.[49] Tämä oli hänen ensimmäinen toimenpiteensä.
U||Ja tämä toimenpide kosketti mitä syvimmin hänen kansansa omaatuntoa. Sillä oli ennenkuulumaton vaikutus. Ensi kerran kaikki luokat ottivat saman asenteen. Intia oli löytänyt itsensä.
U||Rauhallisuus oli ollut melkein yleinen. Delhissä ainoastaan muodostui joitakin äkkiarvaamattomia kahakoita.[50] Gandhi lähti sinne teroittaakseen kansalle sen velvollisuuksia. Mutta hallitus vangitutti hänet matkalla ja saattoi takaisin Bombayhin. Huhu vangitsemisesta nostatti Punjabissa kansanmeteleitä. Amritsarissa oli ryöstöjä ja muutamia murhia. Kenraali Dyer saapui joukkoinensa yöllä vasten elokuun 11:ttä päivää ja valtasi kaupungin. Kaikki oli saatettu järjestykseen. 13 p:nä oli suuri hindulainen juhlapäivä. Kansanjoukko lähti kokouksen paikkaan nimeltä Jallianwalla Bagh. Kokous oli rauhallinen, ja mukana oli paljon naisia ja lapsia. Kenraali Dyer oli edellisenä yönä kieltänyt kaikki kokoukset; mutta kukaan ei vielä tietänyt kiellosta. Kenraali tuli kuularuiskujen kera Jallianwalla Baghiin. Ei mitään kehoitusta annettu. Kolmekymmentä sekuntia joukkojen saapumisen jälkeen avattiin tuli puolustusta vailla olevaa joukkoa vastaan; se kesti kymmenen minuuttia, kunnes ampumavara
U||t loppuivat. Paikkaa ympäröivät korkeat muurit; pako oli mahdoton. Viisi- tai kuusisataa hindua sai surmansa, vielä useampi haavoittui. Ei välitetty mitään kuolleista eikä haavoittuneista. Maassa julkaistiin sotalaki. Terrorihallitus riehui Punjabissa. Nähtiin lentokoneista heitettävän pommeja aseettomien joukkojen keskuuteen. Kaikkein kunnioitettavimpia kansalaisia raahattiin sotaoikeuksien eteen, piestiin, pakotettiin vatsallaan ryömimään ja asetettiin häpeällisten nöyryytyksien alaisiksi. Olisi voinut sanoa, että hulluuden tuuli puhalsi yli englantilaisten valtaherrain. Oli kuin Intian julistaman »Pois väkivalta»-lain ensimmäinen vaikutus olisi ollut omiaan saattamaan Euroopan väkivaltaiset vihan vimmaan, suorastaan raivoon. Gandhi oli tästä tietoinen. Hän ei ollut luvannut viedä kansaansa voittoon valkeata tietä myöten. Hän oli sille luvannut verisen tien. Ja Jallianwalla Baghin päivä oli vain kastepäivä…
U||»Meidän on oltava valmiit tasapainoa menettämättä näkemään», hän sanoo heille, »ei tuhannen miehen ja viattoman naisen murhaa, vaan monien tuhansien, ennenkuin Intia saavuttaa maailmassa arvon, jota ei koskaan tulla siltä viemään… Pitäköön jokainen hirttämistä tavallisena elämänasiana!…
U||Sotasensuurin onnistui muutamien kuukausien ajan estää Punjabin kauhuja tulemasta muualla tunnetuiksi.[51] Mutta kun huhu tästä levisi Intiassa, suuttumuksen aalto kulki läpi maan; ja Englanti itse vavahti. Eräs komissioni aloitti tutkimuksen, jota johti lordi Hunter. Samalla kertaa Intian kansalliskongressi muodosti alikomissionin ryhtyäkseen vastatutkimukseen. Hallituksen silminnähtävä tarkoitus olisi ollut —kaikki älykkäät englantilaiset ymmärsivät sen — rangaista ankarasti Amritsarin verilöylyyn syypäitä. Gandhi ei vaatinut edes niin paljoa. Ihailtavana sovittelevaisuudessaan hän kieltäytyi vaatimasta rangaistusta kenraali Dyerille ja monille syyllisille upseereille, saattaen heidät kuitenkin häpeään. Hän ei halunnut kostoa. Hän ei tuntenut vihaa… »Ihminen ei voi tuntea vihaa hullua kohtaan. Mutta hullulta täytyy ottaa pois keinot tehdä pahaa.»… Hän vaati ainoastaan Dyerin poiskutsumista. Mutta quos vult perdere… Ennen tutkimuksen päättymistä Intian hallitus ki
U||irehti viemään läpi vahingonkorvauslain (Indemnity Act) suojellakseen virkamiehiä; eikä rikollisia upseereita ainoastaan jätetty paikalleen, vaan suorastaan palkittiin.
U||Intia eli näitä järkyttäviä kohtaloita, kun toinen edellistä vielä paljon vakavampi asia, englantilaisen hallituksen tekemä juhlallisten sitoumusten loukkaus, todellakin murskasi täydellisesti lopunkin luottamuksen, mikä maalla vielä voi olla eurooppalaisten rehellisyyteen, ja aukaisi padot suurelle vallankumoukselle.
U||Euroopan sota oli asettanut Intian moslemeille ankaran omantunnon-ongelman. Heidän kantansa oli osittain lojaalisuutta valtakuntaa kohtaan ja osittain uskollisuutta uskontonsa päämiestä kohtaan. He olivat päättäneet vasta sitten käydä taisteluun Englannin puolesta, kun olivat saaneet siltä lupauksen, ettei se hyökkäisi sulttaanin tai kalifin ylivaltaa vastaan. Moslemien yleinen mielipide vaati, että turkkilaisille jäisi Euroopan Turkki ja että sulttaani säilyttäisi islamin pyhien paikkojen kaitsijana ylilääniherruuden Arabiassa (siten kuin sen olivat määritelleet oppineet moslemit) ulkoalueineen Mesopotamiassa, Syyriassa ja Palestiinassa. Lloyd George ja Intian varakuningas olivat tehneet muodolliset sitoumukset. Sodan loputtua ei näistä sitoumuksista jäänyt mitään. Kesän 1919 kuluessa Intian moslemit, huolestuneina musertavasta rauhasta, alkoivat napista; ja tämä oli alkuna Khilafatin (Kalifatin) kiihtymiseen.
U||Se alkoi lokakuun 17 p:nä 1919 (Khilafat Day) mahtavalla rauhan mielenosoituksella, jota seurasi kuukausi senjälkeen (marraskuun 24 p:nä) koko Intian Khilafatin konferenssi Delhissä. Gandhi johti sitä. Nopealla silmällään hän oli heti havainnut moslemien asian sopivimmaksi välikappaleeksi Intian yhteyttämistyössä. Se oli suuri tehtävä. Englantilaiset olivat aina ylläpitäneet hindujen ja moslemien välistä luonnollista vihaa; ja Gandhi heitä suorastaan syyttää siitä, että he ovat tämän vihan suuressa määrin luoneetkin. Joka tapauksessa he eivät olleet tehneet mitään sen vähentämiseksi. Molemmat uskonnot kiihottivat lapsellisesti toisiaan. Hindut eivät laiminlyöneet laulaa kulkiessaan ohi moskeiain, jommoisissa tapauksissa hiljaisuus on sääntönä. Ja moslemeille tuotti huvia haavoittaa hinduja ivaamalla heidän lehmänpalvontaansa. Tästä seurasi riitoja ja jatkuvia tappeluita, jotka ylläpitivät äreyttä. Kumpikaan kansa ei sopinut yhteistyöhön; keskinäiset avioliito
U||t ja ateriat olivat kielletyt. Intian hallitus nukkui varmana tästä ikuisesta jaosta. Gandhin ääni hänen julistaessaan yhteyttä Khilafatin konferenssissa herätti sen äkkiä valveille. Vilpittömän jalomielisesti — ja sitä tehokkaammin — Gandhi selitti, että hindujen tuli olla yhtä mieltä muhamettilaisten kanssa moslemi-asiassa.
U||»Hinduja, parseja, kristityitä tai juutalaisia», sanoo hän, »ketä lienemmekin, jos haluamme elää yhtenä kansallisuutena, niin kaikkien edun tulee olla jokaisen etu. Ainoa arvostelu, mikä tulee kysymykseen, on, onko asia oikea.»
U||Muhamettilaisten veri oli jo sekoittunut hindujen vereen Amritsarin verilöyly-kentällä. Nyt tuli sinetöidä liitto. Liitto ilman ehtoja. Moslemit olivat Intian kansan rohkein aines. He juuri ensimmäisinä päättivät tässä Khilafatin konferenssissa kieltäytyä yhteistoiminnasta hallituksen kanssa, elleivät saisi tahtoaan läpi. Gandhi hyväksyi heidän päätöksensä. Hän kieltäytyi kuitenkin, uskollisena sovitteluaatteelleen, vieromasta englantilaisia kauppatavaroita, koska hän tässä asiassa näki samalla koston ja heikkouden merkin. Toinen Khilafatin konferenssi Amritsarissa joulukuun lopulla 1919 päätti lähettää Eurooppaan edustajansa viemään varakuninkaalle uhkavaatimuksen sen tapauksen varalta, että rauha olisi Intian toivomusten vastainen. Kolmas konferenssi Bombayssa, helmikuussa 1920, julkaisi moslemien manifestin, joka suomi englantilaista politiikkaa ja ennusti ukkosta.
U||Gandhi näki sen lähestyvän, joskaan ei vaikuttanut sen puhkeamiseen, päinvastoin koetti kaikin mokomin estää sitä.
U||Näytti siltä, että Englannissa viimeinkin ymmärrettiin vaara. Myöhästynein myönnytyksin koetettiin sitä torjua. Asiakirja Intian reformista, perustana Montagu-Chelmsfordin tiedonannot, myönsi Intian kansalle lisää valtaa ja vastuunalaisuutta niin keskushallituksessa kuin maaseutuhallinnoissakin. Kuningas antoi julistuksella joulukuun 24 p:ltä 1919 siihen suostumuksensa, kehoitti Intian kansaa ja virkamiehiä toimimaan yhdessä asian hyväksi ja käski varakuningasta vapauttamaan poliittiset vangit. Aina jalomielisyydelle altis Gandhi näytti liikutetulta ja nähden näissä toimenpiteissä tavallaan Englannin salaisen sitoumuksen tehdä oikeutta Intialle hän neuvoi hyväksymään parannukset; hän arvioi ne kyllä epätäydellisiksi, mutta luuli niiden voivan olla lähtökohtana laajempiin laillisiin valloituksiin ja kehoitti siis niihin vilpittömästi yhtymään. Vilkkaiden väittelyiden jälkeen hänen mielipiteensä pääsi voitolle koko Intian kansalliskongressissa.
U||Mutta tämä viimeinen toivo petti kuten aikaisemmatkin. Varakuningas välitti viis siitä, että hänen lempeyteensä vedottiin; vankilat kyllä avautuivat, mutta tekoja varten, jotka kiihoittivat Intiaa äärimmilleen. Kävi selville, että parannuslupaukset jäisivät houkutukseksi.
U||Näihin aikoihin (toukokuun 14 p:nä 1920) Intia sai tietää rauhanehdoista, jotka olivat tuhoisat Turkille. Varakuninkaan lähetti tunnusti niiden kylläkin saattavan olla tuskalliset moslemeille, mutta hän kehoitti heitä kuitenkin tyytymään kohtaloonsa.
U||Vihdoin näinä samoina päivinä myöhästyneenä julkaistu tutkimuskomissionin Amritsarin verilöylyistä antama julkinen tiedonanto lopullisesti nostatti maan omantunnon.
U||Se siitä seurasi! Siteet katkesivat. Khilafatin komitea, joka kokoontui Bombayssa toukokuun 28 p:nä 1920, omaksui Gandhin ehdottaman »Pois yhteistoiminta» -tunnuslauseen; ja Allahabadin hindumoslemien konferenssi äänesti yksimielisesti sen puolesta 30 p:nä kesäkuuta; se määräsi varakuninkaalle kuukauden määräajan uhkavaatimuksen miettimistä varten.
U||Gandhi kirjoittaa itse varakuninkaalle. Hän antaa tietoja »Pois yhteistoiminta» -liikkeestä. Hän selittää, miksi hän siihen turvautuu; ja hänen mainitsemansa syyt ovat ihmeelliset. Vielä tällä tärkeimmällä hetkelläkin hän ilmituo halunsa säilyttää välit Englannin kanssa ja toivonsa saattaa laillisin vastustuskeinoin Englanti katumukseen ja parannukseen:
U||»Minulle jää», sanoo hän, »vain kaksi ainoata vaihtoehtoa: joko erota Englannista tai, mikäli vielä uskon brittiläisen hallitusmuodon ylemmyyteen toisiin hallitusmuotoihin nähden, pakottaa hallitus tekemään meille oikeutta. Muuten, minä vielä uskon brittiläisen hallitusmuodon ylemmyyteen. Ja siksi minä kehoitan tottelemattomuuteen.»
U||Tästä selviää, miten suuri on se kansalainen, jota valtakunta sokeassa ylpeydessään ei ole osannut oikein kohdella.
U||II
U||Heinäkuun 28 p:nä 1920 Gandhi ilmoittaa Intialle, että »Pois yhteistoiminta» päätös pannaan täytäntöön elokuun 1 p:nä; ja aatoksi, heinäkuun 31 p:ksi, hän määrää juhlallisen valmistautumis Hartalin paastoin ja rukouksin. Hän ei ollenkaan pelkää kansan raivoa ja yhtyy toimenpiteisiin järjestyksen ja kurin säilyttämiseksi intialaisten riveissä.
U||»Täydellinen Pois yhteistoiminta» vaatii täydellistä järjestäytymistä. Epäjärjestyksen alku on viha. Väkivalta on kerrassaan hyljättävä. Kaikkinainen väkivalta olisi vain taka-askel asialle, se olisi vain hyödytöntä viattomain elämäin tuhlausta. Ennen kaikkea on noudatettava järjestystä!» —
U||»Pois Yhteistoiminta» -liikkeen toimintamenetelmän laati kahtena edellisenä kuukautena Gandhi komiteansa kera. Oli päätetty seuraavaa:
U||1:o. On hylättävä kaikki kunniavirat ja -arvonimet;
U||2:o. On oltava ottamatta osaa hallituksen lainoihin;
U||3:o. On tehtävä lakko oikeusistuimia ja lakimiehiä vastaan ja järjestettävä riita-asiat yksityisen välityksen kautta;
U||4:o. Ylioppilaiden ja perheiden on vierottava hallituksen kouluja.
U||5:o. On vierottava Perustuslaillisten parannusten Neuvostoa;
U||6:o. On jäätävä pois hallituksen vastaanotoista ja kieltäydyttävä julkisista viroista;
U||7:o. On kieltäydyttävä kaikista sotilas- ja maallikkotoimista;
U||8:o. Swadešin[52] levittäminen: toisin sanoen, ohjelman kielteisen osaston jälkeen rakentavan osaston, uuden järjestyksen, jolle rakentuisi uusi Intia. Palaamme siihen myöhemmin.
U||Tässä oli vasta ensimmäinen etappi. Pantakoon merkille tämän miehen varovainen viisaus, — hyvin hämmästyttävä eurooppalaisille vallankumouksellisille — miehen, joka panee liikkeeseen hindulaisen vallankumouksen äärettömän koneiston ja pysäyttää sen kuitenkin heti alkuunsa. Tässä ei ole kysymys Siviilitottelemattomuudesta. Gandhi tuntee sen kyllä. Hän on sen oppinut Thoreaulta, jolta hän lainaa erinäisiä kohtia julkaisuihinsa, ja hänellä on uusi huoli erottaa se »Pois yhteistoiminta» -aatteesta. Siviilitottelemattomuus on enemmän kuin kieltäytymistä tottelemasta, se on lakien väkivaltaista loukkaamista. »Se on rikkomista, jota voi käytännössä menestyksellä harjoittaa vain joku valittu, sen sijaan kuin taas »Pois yhteistoiminta» voi olla ja onkin joukkoliike». Gandhi tahtoo valmistaa Intian kansaa tottelemattomuuteen, mutta asteittain; hän tietää sen tähän puolivalmiiksi eikä tahdo hellittää ohjia, ennenkuin on varma, että kansa on saavuttanut kyvyn hillitä
U|| itseään. Tässä »Pois yhteistoiminta» -ohjelmassa ei ole kysymys edes siitä, että jätettäisiin verot maksamatta. Gandhi odottaa sopivaa hetkeä.
U||Elokuun 1 p:nä 1920 hän antaa merkin kapinaan kuuluisalla kirjeellä varakuninkaalle. Hän lähettää tälle takaisin kunniamerkkinsä ja -kirjansa.
U||»Lähetän alakuloisena takaisin», hän sanoo, »kultaisen Kaisar-i-Hind -mitalin, jonka sain ihmisystävällisestä työstäni Etelä-Afrikassa, hindulaisen vapaaehtoisen ambulanssijoukon upseerina v. 1906 saamani Zulu-sodan mitalin, sekä Buurisodan mitalin, jonka sain intialaisen paarinkantajoukon apuylitarkastajana vuosina 1899-1900… »Mutta», hän jatkaa muistutettuaan Punjabin tapahtumista ja Khilafat-liikkeen alkusyistä, »en voi säilyttää kunnioitusta enempää kuin kiintymystäkään hallitusta kohtaan, jota saastuttaa tällainen moraalittomuus ja tällaiset väärinkäytökset… Hallitus on saatava katumaan… Olen tehostanut »Pois yhteistoimintaa», joka sallii kansalaiselle vapauden olla eri mieltä hallituksen kanssa ja oikeuttaa hänet painostamaan sitä ilman väkivaltaa.» Ja Gandhi lausuu toivomuksen, että varakuningas korjaisi epäkohdat neuvoteltuaan kansan tunnettujen johtajien kanssa.
U||Gandhin neuvoa seurattiin heti. Sadat virkamiehet jättivät erohakemuksensa. Tuhannet ylioppilaat vetäytyivät pois yliopistoista. Oikeusistuimet tyhjenivät. Koulut jäivät autioiksi. Koko Intian kongressi kokoontuneena erikoisistuntoon Kalkuttaan syyskuun alussa hyväksyi valtavalla enemmistöllä Gandhin päätökset. Ystävänsä Maulana Šaukat Alin kera Gandhi kulki halki maan ihastushuutojen kaikuessa.
U||Gandhi ei koskaan ole selvemmin osoittautunut miljoonain ihmisten herraksi kuin tänä ensimmäisenä toimintavuotenaan. Hänen täytyi pitää ohjissa väkivaltaisuutta, joka odotti vain hyökkäyksen hetkeä. Häntä kauhistutti etenkin kansanjoukon anarkinen väkivaltaisuus. Hän ei löydä kyllin kovia sanoja suomiakseen »mobokratiaa» (roskajoukkovaltaa),[53] joka hänestä näytti Intian pahimmalta vaaralta. Hän inhoo sotaa, mutta pitää sitä sittenkin Calibanin vimmaa parempana. — »Jos Intia turvautuu väkivaltaan, ryhtyköön se sitten kurin ohjaamaan väkivaltaan, sotaan! Ei missään tapauksessa roskavaltaan!» Hän epäilee tavallisia iloisia, räyhääviä, mutta hämärään vivahtavia mielenosoituksia, joista ei koskaan tiedä, seuraako niistä mielettömyyksiä ja tihutöitä. »Tästä kaaoksesta täytyy saada nousemaan järjestys. Täytyy lukea rahvaalle sen oma laki.» Ja tämä tarkkasilmäinen mystikko, jonka väkevä käytännöllinen äly ei ole huonompi suurten eurooppalaisten m
U||ystikkojemme älyä, mystikkojen, jotka ovat järjestöjen luojia ja sielujen valtiaita, antaa ylen tarkkoja sääntöjä kansanjoukon mielenilmaisujen virran kanavoimiseksi.
U||»Meidän suuri virheemme on se», hän sanoo, »että olemme laiminlyöneet musiikin. Musiikki merkitsee rytmiä ja järjestystä. Pahaksi onneksi on se Intiassa jäänyt pienen ryhmän erikoisomaisuudeksi. Sitä ei ole kansallistutettu. Syvät rivit olisi pantava laulamaan kansallislauluja. Saapukoot suuret soittotaiteilijat kaikkiin kongresseihin opettamaan syvien rivien musiikkia. Mikään ei ole sen helpompaa kuin taivuttaa rahvas, jolla ei ole omaa selvää tahtoa…»
U||Seuraa sitten säädösluettelo:
U||1:o Ei pidä hyväksyä osanottajiksi suuriin kokouksiin nousukasvapaaehtoisia. On asetettava johtoon kaikkein koetelluimmat; 2:o on annettava jokaiselle vapaaehtoiselle pieni yleinen ohjekirja; 3:o on sovittava kokoontumiskutsuvihellyksistä vapaaehtoisten kesken; 4:o on käskettävä joukon tottelemaan vapaaehtoisia ilman vastaväitteitä; 5:o on sovittava kansallisista huudoista ja määrätyistä hetkistä, jolloin ne päästetään; sääntöä vastaan ei saa rikkoa; 6:o on vaadittava kansaa järjestäytymään riveihin siten, että ajoneuvojen kulkutie on vapaa; kiellettävä siltä pääsy rautatieasemille; on kiellettävä sitä kuljettamasta pieniä lapsia väentungoksiin… j.n.e.
U||Lyhyesti, Gandhista tulee näiden ihmisvaltamerien orkesterinjohtaja.
U||»Kansan ankarin tehtävä on pitää kurissa mielenosoituksiaan».
U||Kansa haluaa väkivaltaa vain ajoittain, tai paremminkin, se ei tiedä mitä tahtoo, se antautuu ristiriitaisten kiihtymysten äkillisiin puuskauksiin. Mutta yksi osa hindulaista valiojoukkoa haluaa tahallansa väkivaltaa; se ei ymmärrä Gandhin ajatusta, kaikkein vähimmin hänen valtiollista voimaansa. Gandhi saa nimettömiä kirjeitä, joissa häntä pyydetään olemaan vastustamatta väkivaltaa, tai joissa — (suurin loukkaus!) — ilmenee sellainen kyynillinen usko, että hänen sanansa ovat vain teeskentelyä vihollisen pettämiseksi, ja joissa häntä ahdistetaan antamaan taistelumerkki. Gandhi vastaa tuimasti. Hän väittelee kiivaasti. Hyvin kauniissa kirjoitelmissa hän taistelee »kalpaoppia vastaan». Hän kumoaa väitteen, että hindulaisten pyhät kirjat ja Koraani hyväksyisivät väkivallan. Väkivalta ei ole minkään uskonnon credo. Jeesus on passiivisen vastarinnan ruhtinas. Bhagavad Gîtâ ei opeta väkivaltaa, mutta kylläkin velvollisuuden täyttämistä hengenkin uhalla.[54] »Ihmise
U||llä ei ole voimaa luoda, hänellä ei siis ole oikeutta hävittääkään…» On rakastettava sitäkin, joka tekee pahaa; tämä ei merkitse sitä, että olisi siedettävä pahaa. Gandhi hoitaisi kenraali Dyeria tämän mahdollisesti sairastuessa. Mutta jos hänen oma poikansa viettäisi häpeällistä elämää, »minun rakkauteni vaatisi», hän kirjoittaa, »minua häneltä epäämään ylläpidon, vaikka se merkitsisikin hänen kuolemaansa.» Ihmisellä ei ole oikeutta pakottaa pahaa ihmistä väkivoimalla. Mutta hänellä on velvollisuus häntä vastustaa eroten hänestä millä hinnalla tahansa. Ja vihollisen katuessa hänelle on avattava syli.
U||Samalla kuin hän hillitsee väkivaltaisia, hän rohkaisee epäröiviä. Hän tukee niitä, jotka arkailevat ryhtyä suoranaiseen tekoon:
U||»Ei mitään maailmassa ole saavutettu ilman suoranaista tekoa. Olen hyljännyt sanat passiivinen vastarinta niiden riittämättömyyden takia… Juuri suoranainen teko muutti Etelä-Afrikassa kenraali Smutsin mielen… Mikä on suurin yhteisymmärrys, jonka Kristus ja Buddha ovat toteuttaneet? Se on voiman ja lempeyden yhteistyö. Buddha on vienyt sodan vihollisleiriin, hän on pannut polvilleen julkean pappissäädyn. Kristus on ajanut temppelistä myyjät, hän on suominut tekopyhiä ja farisealaisia … Se on suoraa, mitä kiihkeintä toimintaa… Ja samalla on heidän tekojensa takana ääretön lempeys…
U||Hän vetoaa myöskin englantilaisten sydämeen ja järkeen. Hän kutsuu heitä »rakkaiksi ystäviksi»; hän muistuttaa heille olleensa kolmekymmentä vuotta heidän uskollisena seuralaisenaan; hän pyytää heitä oikaisemaan hallituksensa kierouksia. »Sen kavaluus on murskannut uskoni siihen. Mutta minä uskon vielä englantilaiseen miehuuteen. Intia voi teille panna vastapainoksi nyt ainoastaan siveellisen miehuuden. »Pois yhteistoiminta» on itsensä uhrausta. Minä haluan teidät voittaa kärsimyksilläni…»
U||Hänen neljä- tai viisikuukautisella kamppailullansa ei ollut tarkoituksena ainoastaan halvaannuttaa Englannin hallitus olemalla mitään hyväksymättä, vaan myös järjestää uusi, itse itseään tyydyttämään kykenevä Intia, joka voisi luoda itselleen sekä aineellisesti että siveellisesti riippumattoman olemassaolon. Ensimmäinen kohta oli sen taloudellisen riippumattomuuden varmentaminen. Tätä Gandhi kutsuu Swadešiksi (tai paremminkin, se on sanan eri merkityksistä vastaavin ja käytännöllisin).
U||Nähtävästi Intian täytyi oppia kieltäytymään useista aineellisista mukavuuksista, hyväksymään vaikerruksitta monta epäkohtaa. Terveellinen kuri. Tarpeellinen hygienia. Kansan terveys löytäisi siitä hyödyn yhtä hyvin kuin siveellisen lakinsa. Ennen kaikkea täytyi Intialta poistaa »juomien kirous», muodostaa raittiusseuroja, vieroa Euroopan viinejä, saada myyjät kieltäytymään veroistaan.[55] Intia ymmärsi Mahatman äänen. Raittiusaalto kulki yli maan, ja Gandhin täytyi asettua väliin, ettei kansanjoukko väkisinkin salpaisi ja ryöstäisi puoteja. Sillä »ei ole luvallista tehdä väkisin ihmisiä puhtaiksi.»
U||Mutta jos olikin suhteellisesti helppoa poistaa juomisen maanvaiva, oli muuten vaikeata varmentaa Intian elinmahdollisuudet. Millä se ravitsisi itseään? Miten se pukeutuisi hyljättyään eurooppalaiset tuotteet? Gandhin ohje on äärimmäisen yksinkertainen, siinä ilmenevät hänen henkensä keskiaikaiset pyrkimykset; hän toivoo, että kaikissa Intian perheissä otettaisiin jälleen käytäntöön kotoinen vanha rukkiteollisuus (rukki — charkâ.)
U||On voitu kääntää pilkaksi tämän yhteiskuntakysymyksen patriarkaalinen ratkaisu.[56] Mutta on pyrittävä ymmärtämään Intian erikoisia olosuhteita ja sitä erikoista merkitystä, minkä Gandhi antaa charkâlle. Hän ei ole koskaan väittänyt kehruuta riittäväksi elinkeinoksi, paitsi aivan köyhille, mutta se menestyisi maanviljelyksen haarateollisuutena tämän ollessa seisauksissa. Kysymys ei ole teoreettinen; se on kipeä ja ylen tärkeä: 80 % Intian väestöstä on maanviljelijöitä, jotka eivät toimi neljänä kuukautena vuodessa. Kymmenes osa kansasta on tavallisesti nälkiintynyt. Keskiluokka ei saa riittävästi ravintoa. Englanti ei ole tehnyt mitään parantaakseen tätä tilaa; se on sitä huomattavasti huonontanut. Englantilaiset yhtymät ovat hävittäneet paikallisen teollisuuden, imeneet Intian varat ja keinotelleet siltä vuosittain kuusikymmentä miljoonaa rupia. Intia, joka valmistaa kaiken tarvitsemansa puuvillan, vie sitä ulos miljoonia paaleja Japaniin ja Lancašireen, jos
U||ta se palaa valmistettuna kalikoona. Todennäköisesti sen täytyy oppia tulemaan toimeen ilman perikatoon vieviä ulkomaisia palveluksia ja järjestämään viipymättä omat työpajansa; sen on mitä pikimmin löydettävä joku keino hankia jokaiselle työtä ja elatusta! Muuten, kaikkein nopein ja taloudellisin on olkimökin teollisuus, hindujen vanha kehruu- ja kutomateollisuus. Ei ole kysymys siitä, että pantaisiin kutomaan työssä olevia ja hyvin ansaitsevia maanviljelystyöläisiä, vaan sekä joutilaita ja kulkureita että naisia ja lapsia ynnä kaikkia hinduja joutohetkinään. Gandhi määrää siis: 1:o. On vierottava ulkolaisia kankaita; 2:o on kehitettävä ja levitettävä helppoa kehruuopetusta; 3:o on sitouduttava käyttämään vain kotona kehrättyjä ja kudottuja kankaita. Hän uhrautuu tälle propagandalle väsymättömän hehkuvasti. Hän toivoo, että koko Intia pitäisi kehruuta velvollisuutenaan, että sitä opittaisiin koulussa, että köyhät lapset maksaisivat oppinsa rukkitunne
U||illa, että jokainen, mies tai nainen, sillä tekisi tunnin hyväntekeväisyyttä päivittäin. Hän menee mitä tärkeimpiin yksityiskohtiin, antaa teknillisiä neuvoja puuvillan, langan eri kudontatapojen suhteen, käytännöllisiä neuvoja kutojille, ostajille, perheenisille, koululaisille; hän osoittaa numeroilla, miten pienellä pääomalla voi järjestämällä Swadeši-puodin (hindutyön tuotteiden kauppa) saavuttaa 10 %:n voitot j.n.e. Hän käy runolliseksi ylistäessään »rukkimusiikkia», Intian vanhinta musiikkia, sitä, millä itseänsä huvitti Kabir, kutojarunoilija, ja Aureng-Geb, suuri hallitsija, joka itse valmisti lakkinsa… Hänen onnistui sytyttää yleinen mielipide. Bombayssä vallasnaiset ryhtyvät rukkitöihin. Hindut ja moslemit tekevät lupauksen kantaa vain kansallisia kankaita. Muoti innostuu khaddarista ja khadista, joiden hyvän maun tunnustaa itse Rabindranath Tagorekin. Tilauksia tulvii; niitä tulee aina Belutšistanista ja Adenista saakka.
U||Innostus meni liian pitkälle, kun oli kysymys ulkolaisten kankaitten vieromisesta. Gandhikin, niin itsensä herra kuin hän tavallisesti onkin, näyttää menettäneen harkitsemiskykynsä. Hän määräsi kankaat poltettaviksi orjuuden vertauskuvinapa Bombayssa nähtiin elokuussa 1921, kuten Savonarolan aikaan Christo regnante, hovitorilla rovioita, joissa perheiden loistavia kankaita hävitettiin tulella keskellä meluavaa iloa. Eräs Intian englantilaisia jalomielisiä miehiä C.—F. Andrews, Tagoren ystävä, kirjoitti ihailemallensa Gandhille hehkuvan kirjeen valittaen, että nämä kankaat oli poltettu sen sijaan että ne olisi annettu köyhille, ja että vedottiin heimon huonoihin vaistoihin. Hän nousee tätä natsionalismia vastaan, joka on eräs laji väkivaltaa; hän ei voi sietää, että hävityksestä tehdään jonkinlainen uskonto; hävittää työn hedelmä on rikos. Andrews, joka ensinnä oli hyväksynyt Gandhin parannukset, epäilee nyt käyttääkö khaddaria. Näiden rovioiden näkeminen
U|| järkytti hänen uskoaan Mâhatmâ'an. Mutta Gandhi, joka julkaisee hänen kirjeensä ja vastaa siihen lempeästi, liikutettuna tästä tuskaisen sydämen vuodatuksesta, selittää, ettei hän mitään kadu. Hänellä ei ole minkäänlaista vihamielistä tunnetta mitään kansaa kohtaan eikä hän tahdo kaikkien vieraiden esineiden hävitystä, vain niiden, joiden turmiollisuus on ilmeinen. Englantilaiset kangastavarat ovat saattaneet perikatoon miljoonia intialaisia; moni on vaipunut paarian tai palkkasoturin luokkaan, vaimon joutuessa yleiseksi naiseksi. Ei voi syntiä tekemättä käyttää näitä rikollisia kankaita. Intia on liian taipuvainen vihaamaan englantilaisia kiskojiaan. Gandhi kätkee vihansa ja siirtää sen ihmisistä asioihin. Syyllisiä eivät ole ainoastaan englantilaiset, jotka ovat myyneet kankaitaan, vaan myöskin intialaiset, jotka ovat niitä ostaneet. Ei polteta vihasta, vaan katumuksesta. Se on välttämätön kirurginen toimenpide. Ja olisi sopimatonta antaa näitä häväistyjä
U|| kankaita köyhille, koska heilläkin on kunniansa.
U||Aineellisen elämän vapauttaminen ulkomaisesta orjuutuksesta ei olisi vielä mitään. Tulee vapauttaa henki. Gandhi toivoi maansa pudistavan yltään eurooppalaisen kulttuurin ikeen; ja hänen ylpeimpiä pyrkimyksiään oli laskea perusteet tosi-intialaiselle kasvatukselle.
U||* * * * *
U||Oli jo olemassa muutamia yliopistoja ja opistoja, joissa olivat säilyneet, englantilaisen holhouksen alla, vanhan aasialaisen kulttuurin kekäleet. Aligarh oli ollut neljäkymmentä viisi vuotta Intian moslemien yliopisto, islamilaisen kulttuurin keskus Intiassa. Khalsan opisto oli Sikh-kulttuurin keskus. Hinduilla oli Benaresin yliopisto. Mutta nämä hiukan vanhanaikaiset skolastiset laitokset olivat hallituksen alaisia, joka avusti niitä rahalla. Gandhi olisi halunnut ne hävittää perustaakseen puhtaampia keskuksia. Marraskuussa 1920 hän vihki Gujeratin kansallisten yliopiston Ahmedabadissa. Se innostui yhdistetyn Intian ihanteista. Sen kaksi uskonnollista pylvästä olivat Hindujen Dharma ja muhamettilaisten Islam. Se pyrki pelastamaan Intian murteet ja löytämään niistä kansallisen uudestisyntymisen lähteet. Gandhi oli sitä mieltä, oikein kylläkin — ja mekin voimme hyötyä hänen sanoistaan — »että aasialaisten kulttuurien järjestelmällinen tutkiminen on yhtä tärkeää täydellis
U||elle kasvatukselle kuin lännen tieteiden tutkiminen. On tutkittava sanskriitin, arabian, persian, palin ja magadhin aarteita, jotta jälleen löydettäisiin kansallisen voiman salaisuudet.» Mutta ei ole kysymys siitä, että toistettaisiin samaa, mitä jo on sanottu tai tehty kuluneina vuosina. »On perustettava uusi, vuosisatain kokemuksien rikastuttama kulttuuri menneen ajan kulttuurin tilalle. Sen tulee olla niiden erilaisten sivistysten synteesi, jotka ovat vaikuttaneet Intiaan ja antautuneet maan hengen alaisiksi. Tätä synteesiä ei saa toteuttaa Amerikan mallin mukaan, missä vallitseva kulttuuri nielee ja musertaa kaiken muun. Jokaisella kulttuurilla on oleva laillinen paikkansa. Päämäärä on sopusointu eikä väkivalloin aikaansaatu yhteys.» Kaikkien ylioppilaiden on opittava tuntemaan Intian uskonnot. Hindut perehtykööt Koraaniin ja moslemit Sâstroihin. Kansallinen yliopisto hylkää ainoastaan syrjäyttämishengen. Koko ihmiskunnassa se ei hyväksy mitään »halveksuntaa». Tosikansall
U||isena murteena tulee hindustani, sanskriitin, hindin, persianisoidun urdun sekoitus olemaan pakollinen.[57]
U||Henkisille aloille pyrkivät tulevat saamaan ammatillisen kasvatuksen, muut taas kirjallisen. Täten heikkenee luokkien välinen ero. Riippumattomuuden henkeä eivät tule ylläpitämään ainoastaan opinnot, vaan kasvatus, jota Gandhi nimittää »sisäisen kutsumuksen kasvatukseksi».[58] Eurooppalaisen kasvatuksen vastapainoksi, joka pitää vähässä arvossa kätten työtä ja kehittää vain aivoja, Gandhi vaatii tätä työtä kouluissa jo lapsiluokista lähtien.
U||On hyvä, että lapsi itse maksaa kehruutyöllä kasvatuksensa; siten hän oppii viipymättä ansaitsemaan elatuksensa ja riippumattomuutensa. Mitä tulee sydämen kasvatukseen, minkä Eurooppa täydellisesti laiminlyö, on se alusta alkaen otettava käytäntöön. Ja ennenkuin voi muodostaa oppilaita, tulee muovata opettajat.
U||Tämä on ylimpäin laitosten tehtävä, laitosten, joista Gandhi haaveilee saatavan uuden opetuksen kulmakiven, — ne eivät oikeastaan ole kouluja, vaan paremminkin luostareita, joihin keskittyy Intian pyhä tuli ja joista se on myöhemmin leviävä, Lännen suurten benediktiläisluostarien mallin mukaan järjestettyjä laitoksia, jotka ovat maan ja sielun uskonnollisia raivaajia.
U||Meillä on hallussamme säännöt, jotka Gandhi laati Ahmedabadissa sijaitsevalle Satyâgrah Ašram -talolle,[59] suositulle tyttärelleen. Ne tarkoittavat paljon enemmän opettajia kuin oppilaita, ja hän sitoo edelliset luostarilupauksilla. Mutta sensijaan että nämä lupaukset tavallisissa luostareissa ajan mittaan säilyttävät vain kielteisen kurinpidon luonteen, värähtelevät ne tässä pyhiä elähdyttävää uhrausmieltä ja puhdasta rakkautta. Johtajilta vaaditaan seuraavien luostarisääntöjen noudattamista:
U||1:o. Totuuden lupaus. — Ei riitä olla valhettelematta. »Ei saa lainkaan turvautua valheeseen, ei edes maan edun sitä vaatiessa.» Totuus voi vaatia vastarintaa jopa vanhempia ja iäkkäämpiä kohtaan.
U||2:o. »Ahimsâ» (olla tappamatta) lupaus. — Ei riitä olla ottamatta toisen henkeä. Ei saa edes haavoittaa sanoilla niitä, joiden luulee olevan väärässä. Ei pidä koskaan olla suuttunut heihin; täytyy rakastaa heitä. On vastustettava tyranniutta, mutta oltava tekemättä mitään pahaa tyrannille. Hänet täytyy voittaa rakkaudella. On kuolemankin uhalla kieltäydyttävä häntä tottelemasta.
U||3:o. Aviottomuuslupaus, jota ilman on melkein mahdotonta seurata kahta ensimmäistä. — Ei riitä, että välttää himoa, tulee aina tarkistaa eläimellisiä intohimojaan, ajatustensakin. Jos on naimisissa, on pidettävä vaimoaan elämän ystävänä ja säilytettävä hänen kanssaan täydellisen puhtauden suhde.
U||4:o. »Ruokajärjestyksen tarkistus». — On säännöstettävä ja puhdistettava ravintojärjestys. Hyljättävä vähitellen tarpeettomat ravintoaineet.
U||5:o. Lupaus olla varastamatta. — Tämä ei koske ainoastaan toisten omaisuutta. »On varastamista, kun käyttää esineitä, joita ei todellisesti tarvitse». Luonto varustaa päivittäin juuri kylliksi, eikä yhtään enemmän kuin mitä joka päivä tarvitsemme.
U||6:o. Lupaus olla mitään omistamatta. — Ei riitä se, että on omistamatta mitään. Ei pidä säilyttääkään muuta kuin mikä on ehdottomasti välttämätöntä ruumiimme tarpeeksi. On poistettava järkähtämättä liika. On yksinkertaistutettava elämä.
U||Kaksi »lisäluostarisääntöä» liittyy näihin varsinaisiin lupauksiin:
U||1:o Swadeši. — On oltava käyttämättä esineitä, joihin nähden on pettämisen mahdollisuus. Tämä säädös pidättää käyttämästä ulkoa tuotuja tavaroita. Sillä ne ovat vääryydellä omaksi eduksi käytetyn kurjuuden ja Euroopan työläiskansan kärsimysten tuotteita. Ulkolaiset kauppatavarat siis »kielletyn puun hedelmä» Ahimsân oppilaalle. Siitä pakko käyttää yksinkertaisia kotikutoisia vaatteita.
U||2:o Pelottomuus. — Joka pelkää, ei voi seurata edellisiä sääntöjä. On oltava vapaa kuninkaiden, kansojen, perheen, ihmisten, villieläinten ja kuoleman pelosta. Peloton ihminen puolustautuu »totuuden voimalla» tai »sielun voimalla».
U||Rakennettuaan luonteet kerta kaikkiaan tälle rautaperustukselle Gandhi siirtyy nopeasti toisiin opettaviin sääntöihin, joista kaksi huomattavinta ovat nämä: opettajain tulee näyttää esimerkkiä ruumiillisessa työssä (mieluimmin maatyössä); ja heidän tulee oppia Intian pääasialliset kielet.
U||Mitä tulee lapsiin, ovat he Ašramiin tultuaan — ja sinne heidät voi panna jo nelivuotisina — myös sidotut sinne poismenoonsa saakka. — (Oppikausi kestää noin kymmenen vuotta.)
U||He ovat erossa kodeistaan. Vanhemmat luopuvat kaikesta tarkastuksesta. Lapset eivät käy vanhempain luona. Heillä on yksinkertaiset vaatteet, ravintona yksinkertainen, pelkkä kasvisruoka, ei mitään lomaa tavallisessa mielessä, mutta puolitoista päivää viikossa jätetään omakohtaiselle työlle ja kolme kuukautta vuodessa pyhitetään jalkamatkoihin Intian halki. Hindikieli ja yksi dravidamurre ovat pakolliset kaikille. Kaikkien tulee vielä toiseksi kieleksi oppia englanti ja viiden intialaisen kielen pääpiirteet (urdu, bengali, tamil, telugu ja devanagari). Heille opetetaan omilla murteillaan historiaa, maantiedettä, matematiikkaa, taloudellisia tieteitä ja sanskriittia. Samaan aikaan he harjoittavat maanviljelystä ja käsinkehruuta. Sanomattakin on selvää, että uskonnollinen henki leimaa koko opetuksen. Kun opinnot ovat lopussa, saavat nuoret miehet valita, tekevätkö he lupaukset, kuten heitä vanhemmat, vai siirtyvätkö pois. Kaikki opetus on ilmaista.
U||Olen viipynyt hieman kauan tässä opetusohjelmassa, koska se ilmi tuo Gandhin liikkeen korkean henkevyyden ja on tarkoitustensa avulla sen pääasiallisin käyntiinpanovoima. Jotta voitaisiin luoda uusi Intia, tulee luoda uudet vahvat ja puhtaat tosi intialaiset sielut. Ja niiden luomiseksi tulee muodostaa pyhä legiona apostoleja, jotka Kristuksen apostolien tavoin olisivat maan suolana. Gandhi ei ole meidän eurooppalaisten vallankumousmiestemme tavoin lakien ja dekreettien laatija. Hän on uuden ihmisyyden muovaaja…
U||* * * * *
U||Englannin hallitus — kuten kaikki hallitukset tällaisessa tapauksessa — ei ollut ymmärtänyt luonnollisesti mitään siitä, mitä oli tapahtunut. Sen ensimmäinen ilmaus oli mitä suurinta ironiaa. Varakuningas lordi Chelmsford sanoo elokuussa 1920, että »tämä oli kaikista mielettömyyksistä mielettömintä.» Pian hallituksen oli kuitenkin pakko laskeutua näistä ylhäisen ylenkatseen ilmapiireistä. Ja jokseenkin hämmennyksissä ja epävarmana hallitus julkaisi marraskuun 6 p:nä 1920 isällisen ja uhkaavan tiedonannon, jossa sanottiin, ettei se ollut tahtonut järjestää lainkäyntiä rikollisia vastaan, koska liikkeen alkuunpanijat saarnasivat väkivallan poistamista, mutta oli annettu käsky toimia niitä vastaan, jotka ylittäisivät määrätyt rajat ja ryhtyisivät väkivaltaan tai aseelliseen uppiniskaisuuteen.
U||Rajat ylitettiin pian, mutta sen teki hallitus itse. Liike alkoi huolestuttavasti laajentua. Jo joulukuussa 1920 sattui poikkeuksellisen vakava tapaus. Väkivaltaa kaihtava »Pois yhteistoiminta» -liike oli tähän saakka ollut vain väliaikaista koetaktiikkaa; ja hallitus eli toiveissa, että yleinen intialaiskokous loppuvuoden istunnossa sen kumoaisi. Mutta koko Intian kansallinen kongressi, kokoontuneena Nagpuriin, liitti sen päinvastoin perustuslakiin lain ensimmäisenä artikkelina:
U||I Artikkeli. »Kansallisen kongressin tehtävä on saavuttaa Intian kansalle Swarâj (Home Rule) kaikin rauhallisin ja laillisin keinoin.»
U||Se vahvisti »Pois yhteistoiminta» -liikkeen hyväksi toimitetun äänestyksen, jonka oli suorittanut erikoinen istunto syyskuussa 1920, ja se laajensi sen henkeä alleviivaten »Pois väkivalta» -liikkeen perusajatusta; se osoitti, miten välttämätön oli maan eri ainesten yhteisymmärrys voiton saamiseen, ja ylisti hindulais-moslemilaista yhteyttä, vielä enemmän etuoikeutettujen ja sorrettujen luokkien lähentymistä. Se toi ennen kaikkea perustuslakiin oleellisia muutoksia, jotka vakiinnuttivat ratkaisevasti Intian kaikkien puolueiden edustussäännöt.[60]
U||Kongressi ei salannut ollenkaan sitä, että silloinen »Pois yhteistoiminta» oli vasta ensimmäinen aste alkavassa taistelussa.
U||Se ilmoitti, että täydellinen kieltäytyminen yhteydestä hallituksen kanssa ja verojen maksusta astuisi voimaan myöhemmin määrättävänä hetkenä. Valmistaakseen odotellessa maata siihen laajennettiin »boikottausta», rohkaistiin Intian kehruuteollisuutta, vedottiin ylioppilaihin, vanhempiin, maistraatteihin; heitä pyydettiin mitä suurimmalla innolla levittämään »Pois yhteistoiminta» -mielialaa. Ne, jotka kieltäytyisivät tottelemasta Kongressin määräyksiä, suljettaisiin pois julkisesta elämästä.
U||Tämä merkitsi valtakunnan hyväksymistä valtakunnassa, todellisen Intian valtakunnan hyväksymistä brittiläisen hallituksen nähden. Tämä ei voinut enää jäädä toimettomaksi. Täytyi joko hieroa sovintoa tai taistella vastaan. Vähäisellä sovittavalla mielellä yhteisymmärrys olisi vielä ollut mahdollinen. Kongressi oli ilmoittanut saavuttavansa päämääränsä »liitossa Englannin kanssa, jos se siihen suostuisi, ellei, ilman sitä.» Kuten aina Euroopan politiikassa muita heimoja kohtaan, pääsi väkivalta voitolle. Etsittiin tekosyitä. Niitä ei puuttunut.
U||Huolimatta »Pois väkivalta» -aatteesta, jonka Gandhi ja kongressi olivat vahvistaneet, sattui eri paikoissa Intiaa ankaraa epäjärjestystä, jolla oli vain hyvin kaukainen suhde »pois yhteistoiminta» -liikkeeseen. Yhdistetyissä maakunnissa (Allahabad) oli maanviljelyslevottomuuksia, lampuotien kapinoita tilanomistajia vastaan; ja poliisi sekaantui niihin verisellä tavalla. Sitten Sikhien Akali-liike, alussa puhtaasti uskonnollinen, käytti »Pois yhteistoiminta» -aatteen toimintatapoja, ja lopulta liike vei kahdensadan Sikhin murhaan helmikuussa 1921. Ei voitu, rehellisesti ajatellen, saattaa Gandhia ja hänen oppilaitaan vastuunalaisiksi tästä kiihkoilun murhenäytelmästä. Mutta tilaisuus oli otollinen. Maaliskuun alussa 1921 alkoi puristus ja kasvoi kasvamistaan hamaan vuoden loppuun saakka. Se oli valinnut näyttämölle astuakseen tekosyyksi mielenosoitukset juomakauppiaita vastaan. Juoppous ja eurooppalainen sivistys eivät kulkeneet ensi kertaa parivaljakkona. »Pois yhteistoiminta» -liik
U||keen vapaaehtoiset järjestöt kiellettiin. Julkaistiin laki kapinallisia kokouksia vastaan. Eri maakunnissa saivat paikalliset poliisit täydet valtuudet murtaakseen liikkeen, jota nimitettiin vallankumoukselliseksi ja anarkistiseksi. Tuhansia intialaisia jo pidätettiin, ei annettu arvoa kunnioitetuille henkilöillekään. Luonnollisesti nämä toimenpiteet nostattivat meteleitä, ja siellä ja täällä oli poliisin ja kansanjoukon välillä taisteluita, tappoja, tulipaloja. Koko Intian Kongressin komitea, kokoontuneena Bezwadaan maaliskuun viimeisellä viikolla, pohti kysymystä, tuliko julistaa siviilitottelemattomuus. Harvinaisen tarkkanäköisestä se huomasi, ettei maa ollut vielä kyllin kypsä ja kuriin tottunut voidakseen tätä kaksiteräistä asetta käyttää; ja se päätti odottaa, ryhtyen eräänlaiseen siviili- ja rahalliseen liikekannallepanoon.
U||Gandhi ryhtyi entistä suuremmalla innolla sotaretkeensä Intian yhtenäisyyden, uskontojen, heimojen, puolueiden, kastien liiton puolesta. Hän vetosi rikkaisiin parseihin, tukkukauppiaihin, suurteollisuuden harjoittajiin ja enemmän tai vähemmän Rockefellerin hengen mukaisiin ihmisiin. — Hindulais-moslemilaista liittoa uhkasivat lakkaamatta ikivanhat ennakkoluulot, pelko, molemminpuolinen epäily. Hän uhrautuu asialle sieluineen, ruumiineen, haluamatta näiden kahden kansan välistä yhteensulamista, mahdotonta nykyhetkenä, eikä ollenkaan hänen toivomaansa. Sensijaan toivoi hän ystävyyden pohjalle rakennettua liittoa.[61]
U||Hänen korkein pyrkimyksensä oli saada liittää hindulaiseen yhteiskuntaan hyljätyt kansanluokat. Intohimoinen paariain oikeuksien takaisinvaatiminen, hänen inhon- ja tuskanhuutonsa tämän hirvittävän yhteiskunnallisen vääryyden johdosta riittäisivät saattamaan hänen nimensä kuolemattomaksi. Kärsimyksellä, minkä hänelle tuotti »hindulaisuuden häpeällisin häpeä», kuten hän sanoi, oli alkunsa lapsuuden mielenailahteluissa. Hän kertoo, että hänen pienenä ollessaan eräs paaria tuli hänen taloonsa karkeampia töitä tekemään; lasta kiellettiin koskemasta häneen ilman että heti peseytyi; hän ei sitä ollenkaan hyväksynyt ja kinaili vanhempainsa kanssa. Koulussa hän usein koski »halveksittuihin». Hänen äitinsä neuvoi häntä saastutuksesta pääsemiseksi sen jälkeen koskettamaan moslemia. Mutta kahdentoista vanhana hänen päätöksensä oli tehty. Hän vannoi omassa mielessään hävittävänsä tämän synnin Intian omaltatunnolta. Hän suunnitteli apua alennetuille velj
U||illeen. Ei koskaan hänen henkensä ilmene vapaampana kuin silloin, kun hän palvelee heidän asiaansa. Tästä voi päättää, että hän olisi ollut valmis uhraamaan uskontonsakin, jos hänelle olisi todistettu, että »halveksiminen» oli yksi sen opinkappaleita. Ja tämä ainut vääryys selittää hänen silmissään kaiken sen, mitä intialaiset saavat kärsiä maailmassa…
U||»On vain ikuisen oikeuden palaamista se, että intialaiset ovat tulleet keisarikunnan paarioiksi. Peskööt intialaiset ensin verentahraamat kätensä… Koskemiskielto on alentanut Intian. Etelä-Afrikassa, itäisessä Afrikassa, Kanadassa intialaisia suorastaan on kohdeltu paarioina. Swarâj (Home Rule) on mahdoton, niin kauan kuin on olemassa paarioita. Intia on syypää. Englanti ei ole tehnyt mitään sen mustempaa. Ensimmäinen velvollisuus on suojella heikkoja ja olla loukkaamatta ihmisen omaatuntoa. Emme ole roistoja parempia hamaan siihen saakka kunnes olemme peseytyneet tästä synnistä. Swarâjin tulee olla oikeuden hallitsemista yli koko maan…»
U||Gandhi tahtoi, että kansallinen lakialaativa kokous parantaisi mitä pikimmin paaria-veljien kohtalon, että heille suotaisiin suuri joukko kouluja ja kaivoja — sillä yleisten kaivojen käyttö oli heiltä kielletty. — Mutta suo siellä, vetelä täällä … Hänen kärsimättömyytensä, joka ei salli hänen odottaa kädet ristissä, kunnes etuoikeutetut luokat ovat parantaneet vääryytensä, saattaa hänet paariain leiriin; hän asettuu heidän etunenäänsä, koettaa heitä ryhmittää. Hän tutkii heidän kanssaan eri toimintamuotoja: mitä voivat he? Vedota tässä asiassa Intian hallitukseen? Se merkitsisi orjuuden vaihtamista toiseen… Hyljätä hindulaisuus — (huomattakoon tämä suuren hinduuskovaisen ylevä rohkeus!) — ja kääntyä kristinuskoon tai muhamettilaisuuteen? Gandhi olisi valmis sitä ehdottamaan, jos hindulaisuus ja koskettamiskielto olisivat erottamattomat. Mutta hän on vakuutettu, että se on vain hindulaisuuden epäterve kasvannainen, joka täytyy poistaa. Paariain tul
U||ee siis järjestäytyä puolustautuakseen. Heillä olisi yksi keino; käyttää »pois yhteistoiminta» -asetta hindulaisuuttakin vastaan, lopettaen kaikki suhteet muihin hinduihin (tämän isänmaanystävän suussa ihmeellisen rohkea neuvo yhteiskunnalliseen kapinaan!). Mutta, Gandhi jatkaa, paariat eivät kykene mihinkään järjestäytymiseen, heillä ei ole johtajia. Yhtykööt he siis — se on ainoa keino, mikä heille jää — yleiseen intialaiseen »pois yhteistoiminta» -liikkeeseen, jonka ensimmäinen ehto on luokkien yhtyminen! Todellinen »pois yhteistoiminta» -aate on puhdistava uskonnollinen toimitus. Ei kukaan voi ottaa siihen osaa hylkäämällä paariat; hän rikkoisi siten raskaasti. Täten Gandhin onnistui sovittaa uskonto, isänmaa ja ihmisyys.
U||»Poljettujen» luokkien konferenssi (Suppressed Classes Conference), jota Gandhi johti Ahmedabadissa huhtikuun 13 ja 14 p:nä 1921, vihki juhlallisesti nämä ensimmäiset ryhmitysyritykset. Hän piti siellä yhden valtavimmista puheistaan. Hän ei tyydy julistamaan yhteiskunnallisen erilaisuuden lakkauttamista; hän odottaa paarioilta suuria asioita uudestisyntyneen Intian yhteiskunnallisessa elämässä; hän antaa heille takaisin luottamuksen itseensä; hän puhaltaa heihin polttavan toivon, joka häntä itseään elähdyttää. Hän on heissä huomannut, hän sanoo, suunnattomia salaisia mahdollisuuksia. Hän laskee »halveksittujen» viidessä kuukaudessa osaavan arvollaan saavuttaa oikean paikkansa intialaisessa suuressa perheessä.
U||Gandhia ilahdutti nähdä Intian heltyvän, kun vedottiin sen sydämeen, ja paariain vapauttaminen toteutui lukuisissa paikoissa.[62] Vangitsemisensa aattona Gandhi huolehti vielä tästä asiasta ja kertoili sen edistyksestä. Bramaanit uhrautuivat. Etuoikeutetut luokat antoivat liikuttavia esimerkkejä katumuksesta ja veljellisestä rakkaudesta. Gandhi mainitsee tapauksen nuoresta kahdeksantoistavuotisesta bramaanista, joka ryhtyi lakeijaksi elääkseen paariain kanssa.
U||Yhtä ylevämielisen innokkaasti Gandhi ajoi toista suurta asiaa — naisasiaa.
U||Sukupuolikysymys on erikoisen vakava Intiassa, jonka aistillisuus on ylitsevuotavan rikas, rasittava ja huonosti säännöstelty. Lapsiavioliitot ennen aikojaan tyhjentävät kansan ruumiilliset ja siveelliset voimat. Ajatusta painaa lihallinen kiusaus; vaimon arvoa se alentaa. Gandhi julkaisee hindunaisten valitukset siitä alentavasta tavasta, jolla kansallismieliset hindut heitä kohtelevat Hän pitää heidän valituksiansa oikeutettuina. Tässä on, hän sanoo, Intian haava, yhtä kipeä kuin »halveksiminen». Mutta hän lisää: koko maailma kärsii siitä. Kysymys on yleismaailmallinen.
U||Kuten paariakysymyksessäkin, hän odottaa tässä asiassa raskautettujen edistyvän paljon enemmän kuin rasittajien. Hän kääntyy naisten puoleen neuvoen heitä ensin herättämään kunnioitusta lakkaamalla pitämästä itseään miehen halujen esineenä. Ottakoot he päättävästi osaa julkiseen elämään, uskaltautukoot sen vaivoihin ja vaaroihin. Älkööt he ainoastaan kieltäytykö ylellisyydestään pois heittämällä ja polttamalla ulkolaiset kankaat, vaan jakakoot he kaikki miehen vaivat. Kalkutassa on jo vangittu korkea-arvoisia naisia. Se on hyvä. Kaukana siitä, että vaatisivat lievitystä kohteluun, kilpailkoot he päinvastoin miesten kanssa kestämisessä ja kieltäymyksessä! Tällä alalla nainen voi aina mennä miehen edelle. Älkööt he epäilkö mitään! Heikoinkin voi varjella kunniaansa. Riittää, että osaa kuolla.
U||Hän ei unohtanut langenneita sisariammekaan.[63] Hän kertoo keskusteluista, joita hänellä oli usean sadan heikäläisen kanssa Andrhan maakunnassa ja Barisalissa. Miten yksinkertaisen ylevästi hän puhuu heille ja he hänelle; he uskovat itsensä hänelle, kysyvät häneltä neuvoa! Hän etsii heille kunniallista ammattia, ehdottaa heille rukkia, he lupaavat ruveta sitä käyttämään jo seuraavana päivänä, jos heitä autetaan. — Ja kääntyen Intian miesten puoleen Gandhi muistuttaa heille naisen kunnioituksesta:
U||»Meidän vallankumouksessamme ei ole paikallaan tällainen synnillä leikkiminen. Swarâj merkitsee sitä, että pidämme kaikkia Intian asukkaita veljinä ja sisarina… Kunnioitus kaikkia kohtaan! Naissukupuoli ei ole heikko sukupuoli, se on jalompi näistä kahdesta, koska sillä on kyky uhrautua, hiljaa kärsiä, olla nöyrä, koska sillä on usko ja tunto. Naisen intuitio on usein voittanut miehen julkeasti itselleen omistavan ylemmän ymmärryksen…»
U||Hän löysi Intian naisissa — alkaen omasta vaimostaan — järkeviä apulaisia ja parhaita oppilaitaan.
U||III
U||Vuosi 1921 merkitsee Gandhin vaikutuksen korkeinta huippua. Hänellä on ääretön siveellinen voima; ja hänen itsensä sitä tavoittelematta pannaan hänen käsiinsä melkein rajaton valtiollinen mahti. Kansa uskoo häntä pyhimykseksi; hänestä tehdään maalauksia Šri-Krišnana.[64] Ja joulukuussa 1921 koko Intian Kongressi asettaa hänet täyteen arvovaltaan; hänellä on oikeus valita seuraajansa. Hän on Intian kansan kieltämätön johtaja. Hänestä riippuu, päästääkö vai ei valloilleen valtiollinen vallankumous ja luodako vaikkapa uskonnollinen uudistus.
U||Hän ei sitä tehnyt. Hän ei halunnut sitä. Siveellistä suuruuttako? Siveellistä arkuuttako? Ehkä molempaakin. Jokaiselle on vaikeata (etenkin toisenlaista sivistystä edustavalle ihmiselle) tunkeutua syvälle johonkin omaantuntoon, etenkin kun se on niin syvä ja herkkä kuin Gandhin. On vaikeata arvata tekojen pyörteessä, jotka tänä melskeisenä vuonna kuohuttivat Intiaa kaikin tavoin, onko perämiehen käsi aina ollut varma ja ohjannut jättiläislaivaa hairahtumatta, vapisematta. Mutta minä koetan sanoa sen, minkä luulen saaneeni ilmi tästä elävästä arvoituksesta, tätä nuorta miestä kohtaan tuntemallani suurella kunnioituksella ja vilpittömyydellä, minkä olen velkaa hänen vilpittömyydelleen.
U||* * * * *
U||Vaikka Gandhin valta olikin suuri, eivät sen käyttämisen vaarat olleet pienemmät. Sitä mukaa kuin julkinen toiminta laajeni ja värähdytti satoja miljoonia ihmisiä, tuli vaikeammaksi sitä ohjata ja säilyttää oma tasapaino tällä meuruavalla merellä. Oli yli-inhimillinen tehtävä säilyttää hengen hillintä ja samalla laajakatseisuus näiden irtipäässeiden, hillittömien joukkojen keskessä. Perämies, lempeä ja hurskas, rukoilee ja turvautuu Jumalaan. Mutta hänen kuulemaansa ääntä hämmentää myrsky. Kuulevatko muut sitä?
U||Seikka, mitä hänen vähimmin tarvitsee pelätä, on ylpeyden vaara. Ei mikään ihailu voi panna hänen päätään pyörälle. Se haavoittaa hänen nöyrää mieltään yhtä paljon kuin älyään. Ainutlaatuinen tapaus profeettain ja suurten mystikkojen historiassa on seikka, ettei hän ollenkaan näe näkyjä eikä ilmestyksiä eikä pyri sellaisia itselleen enempää kuin muillekaan uskottelemaan. Tahratonta vilpittömyyttä! Hänen järkensä ei lankea hurmioon eikä sydämensä turhamaisuuteen. Hän on ja pysyy samanlaisena kuin kaikki muut ihmiset… Ei, älköön häntä kutsuttako pyhimykseksi! Hän ei sitä halua. (Ja siksi hän juuri on pyhimys.)
U||»Hän kirjoittaa: sana Pyhä on pyyhittävä pois nykyisestä elämästä… Rukoilen kuten jokainen kunnon hindu, uskon meidän kaikkien voivan olla Jumalan lähettejä, mutta minulla ei ole ollut mitään erikoista Jumalan ilmestystä. Oma vahva uskoni on, että hän ilmestyy jokaiselle ihmisolennolle, mutta me suljemme korvamme sisäiseltä ääneltä… Minä pyrin olemaan vaatimaton työmies, vaatimaton Intian ja ihmisyyden palvelija (a humble servant of India and humanity…) Minulla ei ole mitään halua perustaa lahkoa. Olen todella siinä suhteessa liian kunnianhimoinen. En esitä uusia totuuksia. Koetan esittää ja seurata totuutta sellaisena kuin sen tunnen. Kylvän uutta valoa moniin vanhoihin totuuksiin.»
U||Itsensä suhteen hän on siis aina vaatimaton, kaikissa asioissa mitä tunnollisin, omasta kohdastaan mahdoton kaikkeen poikkeukselliseen niin hyvin intialaisena isänmaanystävänä kuin »pois yhteistoiminta» -aatteen pappina. Hän ei hyväksy mitään tyranniutta edes hyvän asian puolesta. »Ei pidä koskaan korvata hallituksen orjuutusta »pois yhteistoiminta» -aatteen miesten orjana olemisella. Hän kieltäytyy niinikään vertaamasta isänmaataan muihin isänmaihin, eikä hänen isänmaallisuutensa sulkeudu Intian rajojen sisälle. »Minun patriotismini sulaa ihmisyyteen. Olen patriootti, koska olen ihminen ja inhimillinen. En ole ahdasmielinen. En tekisi pahaa enempää Englannille kuin Saksallekaan palvellakseni Intiaa. Imperialismilla ei ole paikkaa elämänsuunnitelmassani… Patriootti on isänmaansa ystävä sitä vähemmin, mitä huonompi humanisti hän on.
U||Mutta ovatko hänen oppilaansa aina olleet yhtä pidättyväisiä? Mitä tulee hänen opistaan joidenkuiden muiden ohjatessa? Ja miten paljon kansa siitä hyötyy heidän välityksellään?
U||* * * * *
U||Kun Rabindranath Tagore monien vuosien matkustelun jälkeen palaa Euroopasta Intiaan elokuussa 1921, on hän hämmästynyt mielten muutoksesta. Hänen tuskansa ei näyttäytynyt vasta hänen palatessaan, se ilmeni jo monissa hänen Euroopasta intialaisille ystävilleen lähettämissään kirjeissä, joista useat julaistiin Modern Review'ssa.[65] On välttämätöntä pysähtyä tähän kahden suuren hengen erimielisyyteen, henkien, jotka kunnioittavat ja ihailevat toisiaan, mutta jotka ovat samalla niin kohtalokkaasti erotetut kuin on kreikkalainen viisas apostolista, Platon pyhästä Paavalista. Toisella puolen uskon ja laupeuden nero, joka haluaa olla uuden ihmisyyden hiiva. Toisella puolen taas älyn nero, vapaa, laajakatseinen ja selkeä, joka käsittää kaiken olemassaolevan kokonaisuuden.
U||Tagore on aina tunnustanut Gandhin pyhyyden; ja olen hänen kuullut siitä puhuvan kunnioituksella. Kun minä esitin Tolstoin olemusta Mahatmana, osoitti Tagore, kuinka paljon Gandhi oli tätä olemusta lähempänä ja hänen mielestään kirkkaamman valon ympäröimä — (ja minä myönnän tämän nyt, kun tunnen hänet paremmin) — sillä Gandhissa on kaikki luontoa, yksinkertaista, vaatimatonta ja puhdasta; ja hänen taistelujansa ympäröi tyyneys. Sensijaan Tolstoilla kaikki on ylpeätä kapinaa ylpeyttä vastaan, vihaa vihaa vastaan, intohimoa intohimoja vastaan, kaikki on väkivaltaa, itse väkivallan vierominenkin… Tagore kirjoitti Lontoosta huhtikuun 10 p:nä 1921: »Olemme kiitolliset Gandhille siitä, että hän antaa Intialle tilaisuuden todistaa uskon jumalaiseen henkeen ihmisessä vielä elävän.» Ja vaikkakin hän jo suhtautui varovaisesti Gandhin liikkeeseen lähtiessään Ranskasta paluumatkalle kotimaahan, oli hän halukas antamaan sille apuansa. Vieläpä muuan huomiota herättävä
U|| manifesti lokakuulta 1921, Totuuden vaatimus, jonka myöhemmin tähän lainaan ja joka vahvistaa välien katkeamisen, alkaa suurimmalla ylistyksellä, mitä koskaan Gandhista on kirjoitettu.
U||Omasta puolestaan Gandhi osoittaa Tagorelle syvää kunnioitusta ja koettaa eri mieltäkin ollessaan pysyttää sen. Tuntuu, että hänestä on työlästä ruveta väittelyihin Tagoren kanssa. Kun hyvät ystävät koettavat kiihoittaa taistelua kantelemalla eräitä yksityislaatuisia puheita, käskee Gandhi heitä vaikenemaan osoittaen, miten paljosta hänen on Tagorea kiittäminen.[66]
U||Mutta on kohtalokasta, että heidän henkinen eroavaisuutensa vahvistui. Kesästä 1920 alkaen Tagore oli valittanut sitä, että Gandhissa asuva ylitsevuotava rakkauden ja uskon voima suuntautui Tilakin kuoleman jälkeen politiikan palvelukseen. Varmasti Gandhi itse ei ollut siihen ryhtynyt sydämen ilolla; mutta Tilakin kuoltua Intia oli vailla poliittista johtajaa. Täytyi astua hänen tilalleen.
U||»Jos minun havaitaan ottavan osaa politiikkaan, sanoo hän nimenomaan hetkenä, jolloin hän siinä suhteessa ryhtyy ratkaisevaan päätökseen, teen sen ainoastaan sikäli, että nykyinen politiikka sieppaa meidät kuin käärme kiemuroihinsa… Koetan saada uskonnon leimaa politiikkaan.»
U||Mutta Tagore valitti tämän seikan tarpeellisuutta. Hän kirjoitti syyskuun 7 p:nä 1920:
U||»Koko se siveellinen into, jota Mahatma Gandhin elämä osoittaa ja jota maailman kaikkien ihmisten joukossa vain hän voi edustaa, on meille tarpeellinen. On raskas onnettomuus meidän maallemme, että niin kallisarvoinen aarre on asetettu politiikkamme hauraaseen laivaan ja heitetty kiihtyneiden vastasyytösten loppumattomaan aallokkoon, maallemme, jonka tehtävä on sielun tulella antaa uudelleen elämä kuolleille….
U||Henkisten voimiemme tuhlaus seikkailuihin, jotka siveellisen totuuden kannalta katsoen ovat kehnoja, on kovin surullista. On rikollista muuttaa siveellinen voima sokeaksi voimaksi.»[67]
U||»Pois yhteistoiminta»-sotaretken raikuvat alkutoitotukset, Khilafat-nimen sekä Punjabin rikosten Intiassa nostattama levottomuus olivat sanelleet Tagorelle nämä rivit. Hän pelkäsi niiden vaikutuksia heikkoon ja hysteerisen raivon puuskiin alttiiseen kansaan. Hän olisi tahtonut sen vieroittaa kostoajatuksista ja teoista, joita olisi mahdoton korjata, saada sen unohtamaan, mikä ei ollut autettavissa, haaveilemaan vain mitä suurimman isänmaan sielun rakentamista. Yhtä paljon kuin hän Gandhin ajatuksessa ja toiminnassa ihaili uhrautuvan hengen palavaa säteilyä (ja sen hän sanoo kirjeessään maaliskuun 2 p:ltä 1921, jonka myöhemmin esitän), yhtä paljon oli hänestä vastenmielinen se kielteinen aines, jonka uusi uskonto sisälsi, — »pois yhteistoiminta». Häntä kauhisti kaikki kielteinen! Ja tässä on hänellä tilaisuus verrata brahmalaisuuden positiivista ihannetta, elämänilojensa puhdistamista, täydelliseen luopumiseen, jota taas buddhalaisuuden kielteinen ihanne vaatii. Tähän t
U||ulee Gandhi vastaamaan, ettei hylkäämisen teho ole vähemmän tarpeellinen kuin hyväksymisen. Ihmisponnistuksessa on kumpaakin. Upanišadien viimeinen sana on kielteinen. Ja Brahman määrittelevät Upanišadien tekijät seuraavasti: Neti (Ei tätä). Intia oli liiaksi unohtanut taidon sanoa: »Ei!» Gandhi on sen sille uudelleen opettanut.
U||»Ennen kylvämistä on kitkettävä… temmattava pois paha.»
U||Mutta eikö Tagore halua mitään kitkeä? Hänen runollinen mietiskelynsä sopeutuu kaikkeen olevaan ja nauttii sen sopusoinnusta. Hän tuo sen ilmi lauseissa, jotka ovat nerokkaan kauniit, mutta äärimmäisen vapaat toiminnasta. Tämä on mielikuvilla leikkivän Natarajan tanssia:
U||»Koetan kaikin voimin sovittaa ajatustapani isänmaani yli kulkevaan kiihkoisan innostuksen tunnemyrskyn säveleen. Mutta miksi on olemuksessani tämä vastustuksen henki, vastoin voimakasta haluani välttää sitä? En löydä selvää vastausta, mutta alakuloisuuteni sumuun pilkistää hymy ja ääni sanoo: »Teidän paikkanne on lasten parissa, maailmojen rannikolla: siellä on rauhanne; ja siellä olen minä kanssanne.» Ja siksi olen äsken leikilläni keksinyt uusia rytmejä. Ne ovat vain tyhjiä, mutta iloisia siitä, että hetken virta on tuonut ne mukanaan; ne tanssivat auringossa ja nauravat kadotessaan. Mutta sillaikaa kuin huvittelen, koko luomus huvittelee: sillä eivätkö lehdet ja kukat ole loppumattomia kokeiluja rytmeillä? Eikö Jumalani ole aikojen ikuinen tuhlaaja? Hän heittää tähdet ja planeetat muutosten pyörteeseen; näkyväisyyden virralle hän heittää aikakausien mielikuvitustäydet paperiveneet. Kun minä häntä ahdistan ja häntä rukoilen sallimaan minun jäädä hänen 
U||pieneksi oppilaakseen ja hyväksymään muutamia tekemiäni pikku näperryksiä hänen ilolaivansa lastuiksi, hän hymyilee ja minä astelen hänen takanaan hänen takkinsa liepeeseen tarttuen… Mutta missä olen kansanjoukon keskellä, takaa työnnettynä, joka puolelta puserrettuna? Ja mikä on melu, joka minua ympäröi? Jos se on laulu, silloin voi sitarini siepata sen melodian, ja minä yhdyn kuoroon, sillä olenhan laulaja. Mutta jos se on valitusta, on ääneni tukahtunut ja olen itsekin turta. Olen koettanut kaikkina näinä päivinä korvaani heristäen keksiä siinä melodiaa: mutta »pois yhteistoiminta» -ajatus hirvittävine, helisevine vyöryineen, kasattuine uhkineen, kieltäymyksen-huutoineen ei minulle laula mistään. Ja minä ajattelen: »Jos ette voi kulkea yhtä jalkaa kansalaistenne kanssa heidän historiansa suuressa vaiheessa, varokaa sanomasta, että he ovat väärässä ja te itse oikeassa; jättäkää sotilaan osanne, palatkaa runoilijanurkkaanne ja olkaa valmiit ottamaan vastaan
U|| kansan iva ja epäsuosio!»[68]
U||Täten puhuisi joku Goethe — intialainen Goethe Bacchus. Ja näyttää siltä kuin tämä olisi hänen lopullinen mielipiteensä: runoilija jättäisi hyvästit kielteiselle toiminnalle ja kutoisi ympärilleen luomisilon lumokehän. — Mutta Tagore ei tee sittenkään näin, sillä hän kirjoittaa tästä: »kohtalo oli hänet valinnut ohjaamaan venettään juuri vasten virtaa!» Hän ei ollut ainoastaan runoilija; hän oli tällä hetkellä Aasian henkinen lähettiläs Euroopassa; ja hän palasi juuri pyytämästä tätä maanosaa liittoon perustaessaan yleismaailmallisen yliopiston Santiniketaniin.
U||»Mikä kohtalon iva, että juuri olen saarnannut merten tällä puolen Idän ja Lännen kulttuurien yhteistoimintaa samanaikaisesti kuin »pois yhteistoiminta» -aatetta saarnataan toisella puolen.»
U||»Pois yhteistoiminta» -aate loukkasi juuri hänen toimintaansa ja henkevää uskoaan: »Uskon todelliseen Idän ja Lännen liittoon.»
U||Se loukkasi hänen rikasta, maailman kaikkien kulttuurien ravitsemaa älyään.
U||»Kaikki ihmiskunnan kunnia on minun… Ihmisen ääretön personallisuus (kuten sanovat Upanišadit) voi toteutua vain kaikkien ihmissukukuntien suurenmoisessa sopusoinnussa… Rukoilen aina, että Intia edustaisi maailman kaikkien kansain yhteistoimintaa. Sille on yhteys totuus ja jakautuminen Mâyâ. Yhteys on jotain, mikä käsittää kaiken eikä siis ole saavutettavissa kieltämisen tietä… Nykyinen pyrkimys viedä meidän henkemme eroon Lännen hengestä on henkisen itsemurhan koe… Nykyaikaa on mahtavasti hallinnut Länsi. Se on ollut mahdollista vain siten, että Lännelle on tullut osaksi joku suuri ihmiselle tarkoitettu tehtävä. Meidän, Idän ihmisten, tulee siitä oppia… On epäilemättä epäkohta, ettemme pitkään aikaan ole olleet kosketuksessa oman kulttuurimme kanssa ja että Lännen kulttuuri on siksi vallannut meidän kulttuurimme oikean paikan… Mutta jos väitetään olevan pahasta jäädä kosketukseen sen kanssa, merkitsee se huonoimman lajisen nurkkakuntaisuuden rohkaisemist
U||a, nurkkakuntaisuuden, josta seuraa vain henkistä vajavaisuutta… Päivän kysymys on yleismaailmallinen. Ei yksikään kansa voi menestyä irtautumalla toisista. On joko pelastauduttava tai hävittävä yhdessä.»[69]
U||Kuten Goethe vuonna 1813 kieltäytyi vihaamasta ranskalaista sivistystä, ei Tagorekaan voi hyväksyä Lännen sivistyksen hylkäämistä. Ja vaikka tämä ei olisi ollutkaan Gandhin ajatus, tietää Tagore intialaisen natsionalismin nostettujen intohimojen antavan tämän sävyn sille. Hän pelkää tämän hengen barbarian tuloa:
U||»Ylioppilaat tuovat uhriantimensa — mille? Ei täydellisemmälle kasvatukselle, vaan »pois kasvatus» -aatteelle… Muistan, että Swadeši-liikkeen[70] ensi aikoina parvi nuoria ylioppilaita tuli minua tervehtimään; he sanoivat minulle siinä tapauksessa, että käskisin heitä jättämään koulunsa ja kolleegionsa, tottelevansa minua heti. Minä kielsin jyrkästi, ja he poistuivat vihaisina, epäillen äiti-isänmaani rakkauden vilpittömyyttä.»
U||Juuri näinä kevätpäivinä 1921, jolloin Tagore sai mielipahakseen kuulla, että Intiassa oli alettu vieroa englantilaisia tieteellisiä harrastuksia, hän sai itse Lontoossa kouraantuntuvan esimerkin tästä henkisestä natsionalismista; erään englantilaisen professorin, hänen ystävänsä Pearsonin luennolla intialaiset ylioppilaat ryhtyivät sopimattomiin mielenosoituksiin. Tagore pahastui. Eräässä kirjeessä Santiniketanin johtajalle hän suomii tätä huonoa suvaitsemattomuutta. Hän panee »pois yhteistoiminta» -liikkeen siitä vastuunalaiseksi. — Gandhi vastaa näihin soimauksiin.[71] Tehden huomautuksiaan Euroopan kirjallisen kasvatuksen siveellistä tasoa vastaan, jolla ei ole mitään yhteistä luonteen kasvatuksen kanssa ja jota voi syyttää siitä, että se on vienyt Intian nuorisolta sen miehuuden, hän tuomitsee tehdyt törkeydet ja panee vapaahenkisenä vastalauseen:
U||»En pidä siitä, että taloni olisi joka puolelta saarrettu ja ikkunani tukitut. Pidän siitä, että kaikkien maiden kulttuurien henki virtaa vapaasti asuntoni halki, mutta kieltäydyn sallimasta sen itseäni valloittaa. Uskontoni ei ole vankilauskontoa. Siinä on paikka pienimmällekin Jumalan luodulle. Sille on vain vierasta eri heimojen, uskontojen ja värien omahyväinen ylpeys.»
U||Nämä ovat jaloja sanoja. Mutta ne eivät tee tyhjäksi Tagoren huolestumista. Hän ei epäile Gandhia. Mutta hän pelkää gandhilaisia. Ja heti laivasta Intian mantereelle astuttuaan elokuussa 1921 häntä tukahduttaa heidän sokean uskonsa johtajan todistuksiin. Hän näkee henkisen despotismin uhkaavan, ja Modern Review'ssaan hän julkaisee lokakuun 1 p:nä todellisen manifestin: Totuuden vaatimuksen, joka nousee tätä orjahenkisyyttä vastaan. Vastalause on sitä vaikuttavampi, koska sen edellä on loistava kunnioituksenosoitus Mahatman olemukselle. Tagore, muistellen Intian vapausliikkeen alkua v. 1907—1908, sanoo, että Intian poliittisten johtajain yleiskuva oli pysynyt myöntyväisenä; se haltioitui Burken, Gladstonen, Mazzinin, Garibaldin varjoista ja osoittautui kykenemättömäksi syrjäyttämään englantia puhuvaa ylhäisöä.
U||»Silloin tuli Mahatma Gandhi. Hän on pysytellyt tuhansien osattomain olkikattomökin kynnyksellä, puettuna kuten he. Hän on puhunut heille heidän omalla kielellään. Siinä vihdoinkin kuultiin totuus, eikä mitään kirjoista opittua. Niinikään hänelle annettu nimitys, Mahatma, on hänen oikea nimensä. Kuka muu on tuntenut kaikki Intian ihmiset omaksi lihakseen ja verekseen? Kosketuksesta totuuden kanssa sielun sorretut voimat elpyivät. Heti kun todellinen Rakkaus oli Intian ovella, ovi aukeni selälleen. Kaikki epäily haihtui. Totuus herätti totuuden… Kunnia Mahatmalle, joka on tehnyt näkyväksi totuuden voiman!… Samaten kuin Buddhan kuuluttaessa kaikkiin ihmisiin kohdistuvaa säälin totuutta, jonka hän oli saavuttanut itsekasvatuksensa hedelmänä, Intia heräsi miehuutensa kukkaan; sen voima levisi tieteisiin, taiteisiin ja rikkauksiin; se on tulvinut tuolle puolen valtamerien ja erämaiden… Ei yksikään kaupallinen tai sotilaallinen toimenpide ole koskaan päässyt samoihin tuloksi
U||in… Rakkaus yksin on tosi. Kun se antaa vapauden, se asettaa sen sisimpäämme.»
U||Mutta tämä jumaloiminen keskeytyy äkkiä. Sitä seuraa pettymys.
U||»Muutamia nuotteja tästä Intian ihmeellisen heräämisen musiikista on liitänyt luokseni merten halki… Odotellen saavani hengittää uuden vapauden virvoittavaa ilmaa palasin iloa täynnä. Mutta se, minkä palattuani löysin, masensi minut. Painostava ilmakehä vaappui maan yllä. En tiedä, mikä ulkonainen puristus näytti pakottavan jokaista ja kaikkia puhumaan samaan äänilajiin ja heittäytymään saman muulin vedettäväksi. Kaikkialla kuului, että äly ja kulttuuri oli pantava lukon taa, oli tarpeen enää vain tarttua kiinni sokeaan tottelevaisuuteen. On niin helppoa kahlita ulkonaisen vapauden nimessä ihmisen sisäinen vapaus!»
U||Tunnemmehan tämän tuskan ja tämän vastaanpanon. Ne ovat kaikkien aikojen tuttuja. Katoavan antiikkisen maailman viimeiset vapaat henget ovat samoin vastaanottaneet tulevan kristityn maailman. Me tunnemme itsessämme nousevan tämän vastarinnan inhimillisiä luoteita ja vuoksia vastaan, joita nostattaa tähän aikaan yhteiskunnallisen ja kansallisen uskon sokea virta. Se on vapaan sielun ikuista kapinaa uskonaikakausia vastaan, jotka se itse on esiin manannut: sillä usko — kouralliselle valituita ääretön vapaus — on sitä ihastuksella tervehtiville kansoille yksi orjuutus lisää.
U||Mutta Tagoren soimaus kantaa kansanjoukkojen kiihkoilun tuolle puolen. Tottelevaisuuden humaltamien ihmisjoukkojen yläpuolella hän saavuttaa Mahatman. Miten suuri Gandhi lieneekään, eikö hänen auktoriteettinsa mene yli yhden miehen voimien? — Sellaista kuin Intian asiaa ei voida antaa yhden johtajan käsiin. Mahatma on totuuden ja rakkauden Mestari. Ja tosiaankin: »kultainen johtosauva», joka voi herättää maamme totuuteen ja rakkauteen, ei ole niitä esineitä, joita voitaisiin teetättää lähimmällä kultasepällä… Mutta Swarâjin (Home Rule) rakentamisen tieto ja taito ei ole pieni asia. Sen polut ovat vaikeat ja aikaa vaativat. Sellaiseen työhön ovat into ja hartaus välttämättömät, mutta vielä enemmän tutkiminen ja tuumiskelu. Sitä varten tulee taloustieteilijän miettiä, työmiehen työskennellä, opettajan opettaa, valtiomiehen harkita. Sanalla sanoen maan siveellisen voiman tulee harjaantua kaikkiin suuntiin. On säilytettävä kaikkialla tutkimuksen henki koskemattomana j
U||a esteettömänä. Ei saa antaa tietoisen tai tiedottoman puristuksen tehdä älyä araksi.»
U||Tagore vetoaa siis Intian kaikkien vapaiden voimien yhteistoimintaan.
U||»Meidän vanhoissa metsissämme asuvat gurut (viisaat) lähettivät moninaisten näkemystensä viisastuttamina vetoomuksen kaikille totuuden etsijöille… Miksei meidän gurumme, joka haluaa meitä opastaa toiminnan teillä, tee samanlaista vetoomusta?»
U||Mutta guru Gandhi on tehnyt tämän ainoan vetoomisen jokaiselle erikseen ja kaikille yhteisesti: »Kehrätkää ja kutokaa!»
U||»Onko tämä uuden aikakauden vetoomusta uuteen luomiseen? Jos suuret koneet ovat vaara Lännen hengelle, eivätkö pienet koneet ole meille vielä pahempi vaara?»
U||Ei riitä edes se, että kansan kaikki voimat toimivat yhdessä keskenään, niiden tulee olla yhteistoiminnassa maailmankaikkeuden kanssa. »Intian herääminen on sidottu maailman heräämiseen». »Jokainen kansa, joka sulkeutuu itseensä, kulkee uuden aikakauden hengenvirtaa vastaan.» Ja Tagore, joka juuri on viettänyt useampia vuosia Euroopassa, haltioituu niiden miesten muistosta, joita hän oli siellä tavannut, niiden kunnon eurooppalaisten, jotka ovat vapauttaneet sydämensä natsionalismin kahleista uhratakseen sen koko ihmiskunnan palvelukseen, — maailmankaikkeuden kansalaisten vainottu vähemmistö, — cives totius orbis, — jotka hän laskee Sannyasinein joukkoon,»[72] niiden, jotka sielussaan ovat toteuttaneet ihmisten yhteyden…»
U||»Ja me, me tyytyisimme yksin lueskelemaan Kieltäymyksen rukousnauhaa, palaamaan lakkaamatta muiden vikoihin, valvomaan Swarâjin rakentamista vihan perusteille!… Kun aamurusko kutsuu lintua uuteen päivään, ei ruuan haku ole valtavin vaisto hänen herätessään. Hänen siipensä vastaavat väsymättä taivaiden kutsuun. Hänen kurkkunsa purkaa ilolauluja uudelle valolle. Uusi ihmisyys on meille lähettänyt kutsunsa. Vastatkoon henkemme omalla kielellään!… Ensimmäinen velvollisuutemme aamuruskossa on muistaa Sitä, joka on Yksi, jolla ei ole luokka- eikä värieroa ja joka erilaisten voimiensa avulla pitää sikäli kuin välttämättömyys vaatii huolia joka luokan tarpeista ja joka luokasta. Rukoilkaamme Sitä, joka antaa meille kaikille viisauden omaksua oikea ymmärtämystä.»[73]
U||Tämä kuninkaallinen puhe, korkeimpia, mitä mikään kansa on kuullut, tämä aurinkoinen runoelma on yläpuolella kaikkien ihmiskiistojen. Ja ainut arvostelu, minkä siitä voisi tehdä, on se, että se liikkuu ehkä liiankin korkealla. Se lienee totta vuosisatojen taustaa vastaan. Runoilijalintu, kotkan kokoinen pääsky (kuten Heine sanoi eräästä musiikkimme jättiläisestä), laulaa Ajan raunioilla. Hän elää ikuisuudessa. Mutta nykyhetki on kiireinen. Kiitävä hetki haluaa välitöntä vajanaistakin helpotusta katkeriin kärsimyksiinsä, — maksoi mitä maksoi! Ja tähän seikkaan Gandhin, jolta puuttuu Tagoren lentoa (tai joka ehkä Säälin Bôdhisattvana on siitä kieltäytynyt, elääkseen osattomien kanssa), on helppo vastata.
U||Hän tekee sen tällä kertaa intohimoisemmin kuin koskaan ennen tässä jalossa kiistassa. Hänen vastauksensa ei viivy; se ilmestyy lokakuun 13 p:nä Young Indiassa ja on pateettinen. Gandhi kiittää suurta vahtimiestä[74] siitä, että tämä varoittaa Intiaa erinäisistä vaaroista. Hän on samaa mieltä hänen kanssaan vapaan päättelemisen välttämättömyydestä:
U||»Ei tule antaa järkeänsä kenenkään säilytettäväksi. Sokea leväperäisyys on usein vahingollisempi kuin pakollinen alistuminen tyrannin piiskaan. Raakuuden orjasta on vielä toivoa; rakkauden orjasta ei ole.»
U||Tagore on hyvä vahti, joka ilmoittaa vihollisten, toisin sanoen ulkokultaisuuden, horroksen, suvaitsemattomuuden, tietämättömyyden, velttouden lähestymisestä. Mutta Gandhi ei myönnä Tagoren soimauksia oikeutetuiksi. Mahatma vetoaa aina järkeen. Ei ole, hän sanoo, ollenkaan totta, että Intiassa olisi sokeaa tottelevaisuutta. Jos maa on päättänyt ruveta käyttämään rukkia, on se tapahtunut pitkän ja uutteran ajattelun jälkeen. Tagore puhuu kärsivällisyydestä ja tyytyy kauniisiin lauluihin. Nyt on sota! Laskekoon runoilija lyyransa! Hän laulakoon perästäpäin. — »Talon liekehtiessä tulessa jokainen ottaa saavin sammuttaakseen tulipalon…»
U||»Kun ihmiset ympärilläni kuolevat ruoan puutteesta, niin on ainoa luvallinen toimeni ravita nälkiintyneitä… Intia on kuin talo tulessa. Intia kuolee nälkään, koska sillä ei ole työtä, joka sille tuottaisi ravintoa. Khulna kuolee nälkään… Ceded Districteissä on neljäs nälkäkausi. Orissa kärsii kestävää nälkää… Intia uupuu päivä päivältä yhä enemmän. Sen jäsenissä ei veri juuri ollenkaan enää kulje. Jollemme tätä käsitä, se kukistuu… Nälkiintyneelle ja toimettomalle kansalle uskaltaa Jumala ilmestyä ainoastaan työssä luvaten palkintona ruokaa. Jumala on luonut ihmisen ansaitsemaan työllään ravintonsa, ja hän on sanonut varkaiksi niitä, jotka työtä tekemättä syövät… Ajatelkaamme miljoonia ihmisolentoja, jotka nykyään ovat eläimiä alempana, ihmisiä, jotka ovat melkein kuolleita. Rukki on miljoonille kuoleville elämä. Nälkä se vie Intian rukin ääreen… Runoilija elää huomista varten ja tahtoisi meidän tekevän samoin. Hän esittää h
U||altioituneille katseillemme kauniin maalauksen linnuista, jotka varhain aamulla laulavat ylistyslauluja tai lehahtavat lentoon. Nämä linnut ovat ravitut. Niillä on jokapäiväinen leipänsä ja ne lehahtavat lentoon levännein siivin, joiden veri yöllä on uudistunut. Mutta olen surukseni seurannut lintuja, joilla voimain puutteessa ei ollut edes halua heikosti liikuttaa siipiään. Ihmislintu Intian taivaan alla nousee heikompana kuin silloin, kun se on ollut lepäävinään. Miljoonille olennoille elämä on ikuista valvomista tai ikuista halvausta… Minusta on mahdotonta keventää nälkiintyneiden kärsimystä Kabirin laululla… Antakaa heille työtä, että voisivat syödä!… Mutta miksi, kysytään, kehräisin minä, jolla ei ole tarve tehdä työtä syödäkseni? Koska syön sitä, mikä ei kuulu minulle. Elän imemällä kansalaisiani. Seuratkaa kaikkien niiden rahojen jälkiä, jotka joutuvat taskuumme, ja huomaatte todeksi sen, mitä sanon… On kehrättävä! Kehrätköön jokainen! Kehrä
U||tköön Tagore, kuten muutkin! Polttakoon hän ulkolaiset vaatteensa!… Se on tämän päivän velvollisuus. Jumala pitää huolen huomisesta. Kuinka sanookaan Gitâ: Tehkää niinkuin oikein on!»
U||Synkkiä ja surullisia sanoja! Maailman kurjuus kohoaa taiteen unelman eteen ja huutaa sille: »Uskallapa kieltää minut!» Kuka ei ymmärtäisi Gandhin intohimoista liikutusta ja ottaisi siihen osaa!
U||Ja kuitenkin tässä niin ylpeässä ja pistävässä vastauksessa on jotain, mikä todistaa eräät Tagoren epäilyt oikeiksi: Sileat Poeta, jokin käskevä vetoaminen taistelun kuriin. Tottele ehdottomasti Swadeši -lakia, jonka ensimmäinen jokapäiväinen velvollisuus kaikille on rukin käyttö.
U||Inhimillisessä taistelussa epäilemättä kuri on velvollisuus. Mutta onnettomuudeksi ne, joille on annettu tehtäväksi sen käytäntöönpano — mestarin apulaiset — ovat useimmiten ahdasmielisiä: he muodostavat itselleen ja muille ihanteen siitä, minkä pitäisi olla vain keino ihanteen saavuttamiseen; sääntö lumoo heitä juuri ahtaudellaan, sillä he viihtyvät vain ahtaalla tiellä. Heille Swadeši on imperatiivi. Se saa pyhän luonteen. Yksi Gandhin pääoppilaita, professori hänen sydämelleen rakkaimmassa koulussa, Sabarmatin Satyâgrah Ašramissa, Ahmedabadissa, D.B. Kalelkar, julkaisee Swadešin evankeliumin,[75] jonka alkuun Gandhi asettaa hyväksymisensä. Tämä kirjanen kääntyy syvien rivien puoleen. Kas tässä credo, jonka eräs puhtaan opin lähteellä olevista, on kansalle opettanut:
U||»Jumala tulee lihaksi aikakaudesta aikakauteen maailman lunastukseksi… Ei ole ehdoton sääntö, että hän ilmestyisi ihmisolennon hahmossa…. Yhtä hyvin hän sen voi tehdä abstraktisen periaatteen tai maailmata lumoavan suuren aatteen hahmossa… Uusi ilmestys on Swadeši-Evankeliumi.»
U||Evankelista myöntää, että voi hymyillä tälle todistukselle, jos Swadešissa näkee vain ulkolaisten kankaiden hylkäämisen. Mutta tämä kysymys on vain laajan, »koko maailmaa sen vihamielisistä riidoista vapauttamaan ja ihmiskuntaa tasa-arvoiseksi tekemään määrätyn uskonnollisen periaatteen» käytäntöönsovittamista. Sen ydin sisältyy hindulaisiin Pyhiin kirjoituksiin. Kas tässä:
U||»Sinun oma Dharmasi, vaikka vailla ansioita, on paras, Sinulle vieraan Dharman saavuttaminen on aina vaarojen saartama. Pyri vain sellaiseen onneen, jonka ydin on velvollisuus.»
U||Tämä Swadešin perusajatus nojautuu uskoon »yhteen Jumalaan, joka ikuisiksi ajoiksi on huolehtinut maailmankaikkeuden onnesta. Tämä Jumala on antanut jokaiselle ihmisolennolle soveltuvan ympäristön, hänelle määrätyn erikoistehtävän mukaan. Ihmisen kaikkien toimenpiteitten tulee mukautua hänen omaan elämäntilanteeseensa… Emme voi itse valita kulttuuria enempää kuin syntymäämme, perhettämme, maatamme; meidän on vain hyväksyttävä se, minkä Jumala on meille antanut, meidän on hyväksyttävä perinnäistapamme Jumalalta tulleina, ja meidän ankara velvollisuutemme on niihin mukautua. Niiden pelkääminen olisi syntiä.»
U||Näistä uskonkappaleista seuraa että yhden maan kansalaisen ei pidä huolehtia muiden maiden kansalaisista.
U||»Swadešin-palvoja ei ota koskaan osalleen turhaa tehtävää koettaa parantaa maailmaa, koska hän uskoo että maailma on liikkunut ja tulee liikkumaan määrättyjen Jumalan suunnitelmien mukaan. Ei pidä odottaa jonkin maan kansan huolehtivan toisen maan tarpeista ihmisystävällisistäkään syistä; ja vaikkakin tämä olisi mahdollista, ei se ole toivottavaa… Oikea Swadešin -palvoja ei unohda, että jokainen ihmisolento on hänen veljensä mutta hänen on silti pysyttävä syntymässä hänelle määrätyssä tehtävässä… Meidän on palveleva niin hyvin syntymävuosisataamme kuin syntymämaatamme kaikin voimin. On etsittävä sielun vapauttamista oman uskontomme ja oman sivistyksemme pohjalta.»
U||Onko kansan edes luvallista kehittää vaurastumisensa välikeinoja: kauppaa ja teollisuutta. Ei suinkaan. Inhoittava into pyrkiä armoittamaan Intiaa mahtavilla kutomatehtailla! Tämä olisi samaa kuin mennä turmelemaan toisten Dharmaa. Omien tuotteiden maastavienti on yhtä rikollista kuin vieraiden tuotteiden maahantuonti. Sillä »proselytismi (käännytyskiihko) on Swadešin periaatteiden vastainen». Ja tämän lain johdonmukainen seuraus (vaikkakin eurooppalaisille yllättävä) on, ettei pidä viedä maasta enempää tuotteita kuin ajatuksiakaan.
U||Seikka, että Intian arvo historian kuluessa on kovasti laskenut, pohjautuu sen Egyptin ja Rooman kanssa kauppaa käyneiden esi-isien rikokseen, joka rikos yhä on uudistunut kaikkien seuraavien sukupolvien aikana. Jokainen maa, jokainen kansanluokka pysyköön omassa kutsumuksessaan, eläköön omista apulähteistään ja perintätavoistaan!
U||Välttäkäämme olla läheisessä kanssakäymisessä niiden kanssa, joiden yhteiskuntatavat ovat erilaiset kuin meidän. Olkaamme kietomatta elämäämme sellaisten ihmisten ja kansojen elämään, joiden ihanne on ristiriidassa meidän ihanteemme kanssa… Jokainen ihminen on puro. Jokainen kansa on virta. Niiden tulee seurata uomaansa kirkkaina ja tahrattomina kunnes saavuttavat autuuden meren, jossa ne kaikki sekaantuvat.»
U||Tämä on natsionalismin voittoa. Kaikkein puhtainta. Kaikkein ahtainta. On jäätävä kotiin. Suljettava kaikki ovet. Ei vaihdettava mitään. Kaikki säilytettävä. Ei myytävä mitään. Ei mitään ostettava. On puhdistuttava. Luostarimunkkien keskiaikaista evankelismia.[76] Ja laajasydäminen Gandhi antaa tähän nimensä.
U||Ymmärtää kyllä Tagoren harmin näiden taantuvan natsionalismin pappien takia, jotka pyrkivät seisauttamaan vuosisatain kulun, sulkemaan häkkiin hengen innon ja katkaisemaan kaikki sillat Länteen.[77] Todellisuudessa tämä ei ole ollenkaan Gandhin ajatus. Hän kirjoittaa suorat sanat Tagorelle: »Swadeši on sanoma maailmalle.» (Siis hän välittää maailmasta eikä hylkää »proselytismiä, käännytyskiihkoa».) »Pois yhteistoiminta» -liike ei ole suunnattu Länttä vastaan. Se on suunnattu aineellista sivistystä ja sitä seuraavaa heikkojen riistämistä vastaan.» (Siis hän taistelee ainoastaan Lännen erheitä vastaan, työskentelee Lännen hyväksikin). »Se on pako omaan itseemme», (mutta väliaikainen pako, kootaksemme voimiamme ja asettaaksemme ne sitten ihmisyyden palvelukseen). »Intian tulee oppia elämään, ennenkuin oppii kuolemaan ihmisyyden puolesta…» Eikä Gandhi kiellä mitenkään yhteistoimintaa eurooppalaisten kanssa, ehdolla, että he sopeutuvat terveelliseen ihantees
U||een, jota hän kaikille tarjoaa.
U||Tämä Gandhin sisin ajatus on suunnattomasti laajempi, inhimillisempi, yleismaailmallisempi[78] kuin hänen lippunsa eli julistettu Evankeliumi. Miksi hän siis on antanut siihen nimensä? Miksi hän sallii sulkea suurenmoisen ihanteensa, joka tarjoutuu koko maapallolle, intialaisen teokratian (jumalaisvallan) ahtaisiin rajoihin? Hirvittäviä oppilaita! — Mitä puhtaampia ne ovat, sitä turmiollisempia ne ovat. Jumala varjelkoon suurta miestä ystävistään, jotka käsittävät vain osan hänen ajatuksestaan! Tekemällä niistä lakikokoelman he hävittävät sopusoinnun, joka on hänen elävän sielunsa pääasiallisin avu!
U||Tässä ei vielä kaikki. Ainakin ne, jotka elävät aivan lähellä Mestaria, hänen suoranaiset oppilaansa, kantavat yhä hänen siveellisen jaloutensa leimaa. Mutta mitä säilyttävät ne, jotka ovat oppilaiden oppilaita, — ja muut, kansat, joille saapuu vain vääristettyjä kaikuja hänen sisäisen puhdistumisensa ja luovan kieltäymyksensä opista? Ulkonaisimman, aineellisimman seikan: Swarâjin (Home Rulen) messias-tehtävän ja rukin. Tämä on edistyksen kieltämistä. Fuori Barbari! Tagore on syystä levoton väkivallan johdosta, jota »pois väkivalta» -liikkeessä apostolit (eikä Gandhi itsekään ole siitä vapaa) osoittavat ei ihmisiä, vaan Lännen asioita kohtaan. Gandhi kyllä sanoo, että »hän peräytyisi taistelusta, jos tuntisi vihaa englantilaisia kohtaan», että tulee rakastaa niitä, joita vastaan taistelee ja että tulee vihata vain vääryyksiä, »vihata saatanallisuutta, rakastaen kuitenkin Saatanaa.» Mutta tämä on hyvin pulmallista puhetta kansan ymmärrykselle. Kun jok
U||aisessa kongressissa liikkeen johtajat muistuttavat intohimoisesti englantilaisten rikoksista ja heidän vilpistään, Punjabin murhista ja Khilafatista, kasautuu vihaa patojen taa, ja voi onnettomuutta, kun pato murtuu! Kun Gandhi johtaa Bombayssa kalliiden kankaiden polttoa elokuussa 1921 ja vastaa Tagoren ystävän Andrewsin haikeisiin soimauksiin Hävityksen etiikallaan, hän uskoo kääntävänsä kansan vihan ihmisistä asioihin. »Mutta hän ei huomaa, että kansan viha kulkee omia uomiaan, vaan ajattelee: »Ensin asiat! Sitten ihmiset!» Eikä hän aavista, että samassa Bombayssa, ei täyttä kolmea kuukautta myöhemmin, kansa tappaa ihmisiä. Hän on liian pyhä, liian puhdas, liian vapaa ihmisessä piilevistä intohimoista. Hän ei kyllin muista intohimojen piilevän niissä, jotka häntä kuuntelevat ja ahmivat hänen sanojaan. Selvänäköisempi Tagore huomaa »pois yhteistoiminta» -ihmisten varomattomuuden, kun he kaikessa viattomuudessaan lakkaamatta muistuttavat Euroopan tekemistä vääryyk
U||sistä, julkisesti opettavat »pois väkivaltaa», istuttaen kansan henkeen kuumeen myrkyn, joka vie väkivaltaan. He eivät sitä epäile, he, apostolit, jotka eivät tunne mitään väkivaltaa sydämessään! Mutta sen, joka ohjaa toiminnan asiaa, tulee kuunnella muiden sydämiä eikä omaansa. Varokaa kansaa! Cave canem! Gandhin kaltaisen henkilön siveelliset käskyt eivät riitä pitämään sitä aisoissa. Ehkä ainut mahdollisuus asian onnistumiseen olisi se, että he tottelisivat horjahtamatta johtajan ankaraa kuria; se, että johtaja suostuisi olemaan Jumala, mihin häntä salaisesti kiihoittavat ne, jotka häntä jo esittävät Šri-Krišnana. Mutta Gandhin vilpittömyys ja hänen vaatimattomuutensa ovat siihen esteenä.
U||Siis jää ainoastaan mitä puhtaimman ihmisen yksinäinen ääni liitelemään ihmisvaltameren pauhun yllä. Kuinka kauan onnistuu sen saada itsensä kuulumaan? Suurenmoinen ja surullinen odotus!
U||IV.
U||Koko vuosi 1921, jolloin toiminta kiihtyy, on täynnä epävarmuutta ja tuimia vastuksia. Gandhi ei jää syrjään niiden heilahteluilta.
U||Kapina nousi, ja hallituksen raa'at pakkotoimenpiteet kiirehtivät sen rytmiä. Malegaonissa, Nasikin alueella puhkeaa verisiä kahakoita, Giridihissä Beharissa meteleitä. Toukokuun alussa 1921 on vakavampia näytöksiä Assamissa, jossa kaksitoistatuhatta kulia jätti työnsä teeistutuksilla. Itäisessä Bengaalissa rautateiden ja laivojen työväki tekee täydellisen kaksikuukautisen lakon, pannakseen vastalauseen. Gandhi koettaa vielä näytellä sovittajan osaa; hänellä on toukokuussa pitkä kohtaus varakuninkaan, lordi Readingin kanssa; hän tarjoo tälle välitystä Ali-veljesten suhteen, joita syytettiin väkivaltaan yllyttävistä puheista; hän saa moslemi-ystäviltään nimenomaisen julistuksen, etteivät he koskaan tule turvautumaan väkivaltaan.
U||Mutta liikkeen voima ei tästä vähentynyt; ja Intian muhamettilainen väestö tekee jatkuvasti mitä uskaliaimpia yrityksiä. Heinäkuun 8 p:nä Karachissa koko Intian Khilafatin konferenssi uusii Islamin vastalauseet, selittäen moslemille olevan laitonta palvella armeijassa tai auttaa sotaväenotossa ja uhaten Englannin hallitukselle, mikäli se taistelee Angoran hallitusta vastaan, julistavansa koko Intian kongressin loppuvuoden istunnossa siviilitottelemattomuuden ja Intian tasavallan. — Heinäkuun 28 p:nä Intian kongressin komitea, kokoontuneena Bombayhin (ensimmäinen uuden perustuslain jälkeen valittu komitea), säätää, että kaikkien velvollisuus on kylmästi kohdella Walesin prinssiä, jota odotettiin pian Intiaan, päättää täydellisen ulkolaisten kankaiden vieromisen ennen syyskuun 30 p:ää, rohkaisee ja säännöstelee kansallista kehruuta ja kudontaa, kiihoittaa taistelua juomia vastaan välittämättä hallituksesta, joka suojelee vähittäiskauppiaita. Mutta Khilafatin moslemeja v
U||iisaampana se moittii meteleitä ja neuvoo luopumaan tällä hetkellä siviilitottelemattomuudesta, samaan aikaan kuitenkin levittäen propagandaa »pois väkivalta».
U||Elokuussa pääsee valloilleen moplahsien raaka meteli, joka kestää useamman kuukauden. Gandhi tahtoo mennä Maulana Mohamed Alin kanssa Kalkuttasta Malabariin sitä rauhoittamaan. Hallitus ei sitä salli ja pidätyttää syyskuussa Maulana Mohamedin ja hänen veljensä Maulana Shaukat Alin ja useita huomattavia moslemeja siviilitottelemattomuuden ehdotuksista, joista äänestettiin Khilafatin konferenssissa. Khilafatin keskuskomitea Delhissä toistaa heti Khilafatin päätöksen, jota vahvistavat voimallisesti sadat kokoukset. Lokakuun 4 p:nä Gandhi julistaa itsensä solidaariseksi moslemiveljiensä kanssa. Kongressin viidenkymmenen tunnetun nimen tukemana hän julkaisee manifestin, joka vaatii takaisin jokaiselle kansalaiselle oikeutta lausua mielipiteensä, ottaako vai ei osaa hallitukseen, teroittaa, miten jokaiselle intialaiselle on sopimatonta palvella, olkoonpa siviilivirkamiehenä tai sotilaana, hallitusta, joka on aikaansaanut Intian siveellisen, taloudellisen ja valtiollisen rappeutumisen, ja ju
U||listaa jokaisen velvollisuudeksi siitä eroamisen. Ali-veljesten oikeusjuttu tapahtuu Karachissa. Heidät tuomittiin syytettyjen tovereittensa kera kahden vuoden ankaraan vankeuteen. Intia kostaa yhä tarmokkaammin. Gandhin manifestin vahvistaa marraskuun 4 p:nä koko Intian kongressin komitea Delhissä. Komitea ottaa päättävän askeleen; se valtuuttaa joka maakunnan omalla vastuullaan ryhtymään siviilitottelemattomuuteen, alkaen verojen maksun lopettamisesta. Se panee ehdoksi, että vastustavien ensin täytyy antaa laillinen todistuskirja täydellisestä Swadešin ja »pois yhteistoiminta» -ohjelman hyväksymisestä, siihen luettuina käsinkehruu ja »pois väkivalta» -aatteen todellinen velvoitus. — Se koettaa täten Gandhin johdolla sovittaa kapinaa kurin ja uhrautuvaisuuden lain kanssa. Tätä alleviivatakseen se ilmoittaa siviilivastustajille ja heidän perheilleen, ettei heidän pitäisi luottaa kongressin rahalliseen apuun.
U||Suuri boikottaus alkoi heti, kun Walesin prinssi marraskuun 17 p:nä nousi Bombayssa maihin. Kylmäkiskoisuuden käskyä seurasivat keski- ja aliluokat. Rikkaat, parsit, julkiset henkilöt eivät siitä välittäneet. Rahvas pahoinpiteli heitä säästämättä naisia, ja meteli syttyi nopeasti; taloja ryöstettiin, yltympäri oli haavoittuneita ja tapettuja. Tämä oli ainoa räikeä purkaus koko Intiassa, jossa määrättyä Hartalia (juhlallinen lakko) uskonnollisesti noudatettiin, rauhassa, ilman välikohtauksia. Mutta Gandhi oli sen takia sanainsa mukaan »kuten nuolen lävistämä». Ensimmäisen uutisen saapuessa meteleistä hän kiiruhti niihin paikkoihin, joissa metelöijät ihastushuudoin vastaanottivat hänet; hänen häpeänsä kasvoi siitä kahta suuremmaksi. Hän nuhteli ankarasti kansaa ja käski sitä hajautumaan. Hän sanoi, että parseilla oli oikeus juhlia prinssiä halunsa mukaan ja ettei mikään voinut selittää inhottavia väkivaltaisuuksia. Kansanjoukko vaikeni, mutta myöhemmin selk
U||kaukset syttyivät uudelleen. Pahimmat ainekset olivat nousseet maasta; kaksikymmentätuhatta kapinassa olevaa miestä ei heti anna itseänsä palauttaa järkiin. Meteli pysyi kuitenkin rajoitettuna; pieninkin eurooppalainen vallankumouspäivä jättää enemmän hävitystä. Gandhi lähetti Bombayn asukkaille ja »pois yhteistoiminta»-ihmisille lohduttomia vetoamisia, jotka sanomalehdistö julkaisi. Hän selitti, että sellaiset näytökset tekivät tällä haavaa mahdottomaksi joukkosiviilitottelemattomuuden, ja hän lykkäsi sen täytäntöönpanon toistaiseksi. Itseään rangaistakseen muiden väkivaltaisuuksista hän määräsi itselleen uskonnollisen paaston kahdeksi kymmeneksi tunniksi viikossa.
U||Intian eurooppalaisia eivät kuitenkaan Bombayn selkkaukset tehneet siinä määrin levottomiksi kuin Hartalin mieltäjärkyttävä yksimielisyys kautta koko Intian. He kiirehtivät varakuningasta toimimaan. Maakuntien hallitukset ryhtyivät moniin väkivaltaisuuksiin, jotka menivät ulkopuolelle laillisuuden. Vedettiin uudelleen esiin vanha laki anarkisteja ja salaisia seuroja vastaan vuodelta 1908; sitä käytettiin kongressin ja Khilafatin vapaaehtoisten yhdistyksiä vastaan. Tuhansia pidätyksiä tehtiin. Seuraus: tuhansia uusia vapaaehtoisia kirjoittautui julkisiin luetteloihin. Maakuntien komiteoille annettiin määräys järjestää vapaaehtoisjoukot ja määrätä näille yhtenäinen kuri. Hartal määrättiin joulukuun 24 p:ksi, prinssin Kalkuttaan tulon päiväksi. Ja sanottuna päivänä prinssi kulki läpi aution Kalkutan.
U||Näinä hetkinä, joissa tuntui piilevän vallankumousta, avattiin Ahmedabadissa koko Intian kansalliskongressi. Sillä oli vuoden 1789 säätykokouksen liikuttava juhlallisuus. Presidentti oli juuri vangittu. Keskustelut olivat lyhyitä. Kongressi vahvisti uudelleen »pois yhteistoiminta» -opin, vaati kaikkia kansalaisia tarjoutumaan »vapaaehtoisiksi», mikä merkitsi pidättämistä, kehoitti Intian kansaa pitämään kaikkialla kokouksia, julisti uskoansa siviilitottelemattomuuteen, jonka voima on yhtä suuri ja ihmisyys suurempi kuin asestetun kapinan; ja se neuvoi järjestämään siviilitottelemattomuuden heti kun joukko tulisi kyllin opastetuksi »pois väkivalta» -aatteen toimintatavoissa. Aavistaen suurimman osan jäsenistään joutuvan vangeiksi istunnon lopussa kongressi antoi Gandhille kaiken valtansa: teon diktatuurin ja oikeuden valita seuraajansa; se jätti hänet yksikseen Intian politiikan johtajaksi, sillä ainoalla ehdolla, ettei hän saa muuttaa kansallista credoa eikä tehdä rauhaa h
U||allituksen kanssa ilman kongressin komitean suostumusta. Kokouksen osanottajista yksi osa oli jättänyt erään ehdotuksen, joka tähtäsi väkivaltaiseen toimintaan, jotta saavutettaisiin mitä pikimmin Intian täydellinen riippumattomuus. Enemmistö sen hylkäsi, pitäen kiinni Gandhin periaatteista.
U||Seuraavina viikkoina ilmeni Intiassa yleinen uskonnollinen innostus. 25.000 miestä ja naista tarjoutui riemulla vankeuteen.
U||Heidän jälessään tuhannet muut nousivat, odottaen vuoroansa, voidakseen osoittaa uskoaan. Uudemman kerran Gandhi valmistautui antamaan määräyksen siviilitottelemattomuuteen. Merkki oli annettava mallimaasta, missä hänen ajatuksensa oli aina löytänyt valiomaaperän: Bardolista, Bombayn maakunnasta.[79] Gandhi ilmoittaa sen varakuninkaalle helmikuun 9 p:nä 1922 julkisella kirjeellä, joka on kohtelias, mutta todellinen sodanjulistus. Hän on, hän sanoo, liikkeen vastuunalainen johtaja. Bardoli on Intian joukkokapinan ensimmäinen liittymä hallitusta vastaan, joka on raa'asti hyökännyt sananvapauden, yhdistys- ja painovapauden kimppuun. Gandhi suo lordi Readingille seitsemän päivää armonaikaa politiikan muutokseen. Ellei hän sitä tee, on käsky annettu: kapina alkaa.[80]
U||Varakuninkaalle osoitettu kirje oli juuri lähtenyt, kun edellisiä verisempi näytelmä näyteltiin Chauri-Chaurassa, Gorakhpurin alueella. Erään kulkueen aikana poliisit olivat hyökänneet kansan kimppuun. Kun heitä vastaan vuorostaan hyökättiin, he avasivat tulen ja pakenivat Thanaan.[81] Rahvas sytytti sen tuleen. Turhaan piiritetyt pyysivät armoa, heidät surmattiin ja poltettiin. Provokatismi oli alkanut heidän puoleltaan eikä heidän murhaansa yksikään »pois yhteiskunta» -liikkeen vapaaehtoinen ollut ottanut osaa. Gandhilla oli siis oikeus vapautua vastuunalaisuudesta. Mutta hänestä oli todella tullut Intian omatunto. Yhdenkin intialaisen rikos koski häneen verisesti. Hän otti päälleen kaikki kansansa synnit. — Hänen järkytyksensä oli niin suuri, että hän seisautti toisen kerran liikkeen, jonka hän juuri oli määrännyt alkavaksi. Tilanne oli paljon tukalampi tällä kertaa kuin Bombayn metelin jälkeen. Hän oli muutamaa päivää aikaisemmin lähettänyt ultimaattuminsa v
U||arakuninkaalle. Miten voida se peruuttaa tulematta naurettavaksi? Ylpeys, »saatana», kuten hän sanoi, kielsi häntä. Tämä oli yksi syy lisää, miksi hän sen kumminkin päätti. Helmikuun 16 p:nä 1922 ilmestyy Young Indiassa yksi tämän elämän ihmeellisimpiä todistuskirjoja, hänen mea culpa'nsa, julkinen tunnustuksensa. Itsesolvauksen pohjalta nouseva ensimmäinen puhe on riemuitsemista ja kiitosta Jumalalle, joka on hänet nöyryyttänyt!
U||»Jumala on ollut minulle ylenpalttisen hyvä. (God has been abundantly kind to me). Kolmannen kerran on hän minulle ilmoittanut, ettei Intialla ole vielä sitä »pois väkivalta» -aatteen ja totuuden ilmapiiriä, joka voi, joka yksin voi oikeuttaa joukkosiviilitottelemattomuuden, ainoan kyllin arvokkaan kantamaan siviilitottelemattomuuden nimeä, s.o. lempeän, nöyrän, viisaan, vapaaehtoisen ja kuitenkin rakastavan, ei koskaan rikollisen eikä vihamielisen. Hän ilmoitti sen minulle ensi kerran 1919, kun alkoi kiihoitus Acte Rovvlattia vastaan. Ahmedabad, Viramgam ja Kheda ovat erehtyneet. Amritsar ja Kasur ovat erehtyneet. Olen tullut järkiini, olen kutsunut erehdystäni himalayalaiseksi laskuvirheeksi, olen nöyrtynyt Jumalan ja ihmisten edessä, olen pysäyttänyt ei ainoastaan joukkosiviilitottelemattomuuden, vaan omanikin… Toisen kerran se tapahtui Bombayn tapahtumain yhteydessä. Jumala pani minut niiden silminnäkijäksi… Pysäytin joukkotottelemattomuuden, jonka piti alkaa Bardolissa. Nöy
U||ryytys oli suurempi, mutta se teki minulle hyvää. Olen varma, että kansa on voittanut tästä siirtämisestä. Täten Intia on pysynyt totuuden ja »pois väkivalta» -aatteen edustajana. Mutta katkerin nöyryytys on tämänpäiväinen… Jumala on puhunut selvästi Chauri-Chauran kautta… Hetkellä, jolloin Intia pyrkii nousemaan vapauden valtaistuimelle »pois väkivalta» -aatteen avulla, rahvaan väkivalta on surullisena enteenä… »Pois yhteistoiminta» -miesten tulee pitää silmällä maan väkivaltaisuutta. Se on mahdollista vain siten, että Intian »huligaanit» kukistetaan…
U||Hän kutsui kokoon helmikuun 11 p:nä Bardoliin kongressin toimintakomitean, jolle hän ilmaisi levottomuutensa. Useat hänen virkaveljensä eivät olleet samaa mieltä hänen kanssaan. Mutta taivas oli hänet »siunannut», hän sanoo, »koska hän löysi heissä niin paljon sääliväisyyttä ja kunnioitusta. He ymmärsivät hänen epäilyksensä ja suostuivat hänen vaatimuksestaan lykkäämään siviilitottelemattomuuden pyytäen kaikkia järjestöjä luomaan »pois väkivalta» -ilmapiirin.
U||»Minä tiedän», lausuu Gandhi, »että tämä näyttää liian vähän viisaalta politiikalta; mutta tämä on uskonnon kannalta ymmärrettävissä. Maa hyötyy minun nöyryytyksestäni ja erheeni tunnustuksesta. Ainoat hyveet, joihin luotan, ovat totuus ja »pois väkivalta». En vaadi mitenkään yli-inhimillistä. En siitä välitä. Kannan samaa lahoavaa lihaa kuin heikoimmat ja olen niinikään erehtyväinen. Minun palveluksillani on paljon rajoituksia; mutta Jumala on tähän saakka niiden vaillinaisuudesta huolimatta niitä siunannut. Erehdyksen tunnustaminen on luudan sipaisu. — Tunnen itseni voimakkaammaksi tehtyäni tunnustuksen, ja asian tulee hyötyä takaisinkimmahduksestaankin. Ei ihminen ole koskaan saavuttanut päämääräänsä ollessaan itsepäinen oikealta tieltä poiketessaankin… Minulle sanotaan vastaan, ettei Chauri-Chaura -rikoksella ole mitään tekemistä Bardolin suunnitelmain kanssa. En sitä ollenkaan epäile. Bardolin kansa on mielestäni Intian rauhaarakastavinta. Mutta 
U||Bardoli on vain yksi piste. Sen ponnistus voi onnistua vain silloin, kun sillä on täydellinen yhteisymmärrys Intian muiden osien kanssa… Arsenikkihiukkanen maitoastiassa myrkyttää maidon… Chauri-Chaura on kuin kuolettava myrkky… Se ei ole ainoa eikä eristetty. Se kuuluu sinne tänne levinneisiin rahvaan väkivaltaisuuden ikäviin satunnaisiin symptoomeihin… Oikea siviilitottelemattomuus ei siedä mitään kiihoitusta. Se on valmistusta mykkään kärsimykseen. Sen vaikutus on ihmeellinen, vaikka tuntumaton ja lempeä… Chauri-Chauran murhenäytelmä on osoittava sormi tiellämme. Ellemme halua väkivaltaisuuden nousevan »pois väkivallasta», meidän on kiireesti tultava järkiimme, muodostettava rauhan ilmapiiri, oltava uneksimatta joukkotottelemattomuuden alkamista, ennenkuin ollaan varmat, että rauha säilytetään kaikesta huolimatta… Syyttäköön vastustaja meitä pelkuruudesta! On suurempiarvoista olla väärin tuomittu kuin pettää Jumala…»
U||Apostoli tahtoo sovittaa toisten vuodattaman veren.
U||»Minun täytyy elää henkilökohtainen puhdistus. Minun tulee kyetä paremmin merkitsemään muistiin keveinkin muutos siveellisessä ilmapiirissä ympärilläni.[82] Rukoukseni tulee olla todellisempi ja nöyrempi. Ei mikään puhdista niinkuin tosi paasto; sen kautta saavuttaa ihminen täydellisemmän itsensä, hengen ylivallan lihan yli…»
U||Hän määrää itselleen julkisesti jatkuvan viiden päivän paaston. Älköön kukaan sitä rajoittako. Hänen täytyy itse rangaista itsensä. Hän on ollut taitamaton kirurgi. Hänen on joko jätettävä kaikki tai saatava varmempi kokemus. Hänen paastonsa on samalla kertaa katumusta ja rankaisua sekä itsensä että niiden Chauri-Chauran asukkaiden takia, jotka ovat rikkoneet, ehkä hänen nimensä huulillaan. Gandhi haluaisi yksin kärsiä heidän puolestaan; heitä hän neuvoo antautumaan hallitukselle ja tunnustamaan. Sillä he ovat tehneet hirvittävän karhunpalveluksen asialle, jota he tahtoivat palvella.
U||»Haluaisin kärsiä kaikki nöyryytykset, kaikki kidutukset, täydellisen ostrakismin, jopa kuolemankin, jos vain voisin ostaa liikkeemme tulemasta väkivallaksi tai väkivallan edelläkävijäksi…»
U||* * * * *
U||Ihmisomantunnon historiassa on vähän yhtä yleviä sivuja. Sellaisen työn siveellinen arvo on poikkeuksellinen. Poliittisena tekona se on suorastaan hämmästyttävä. Gandhi tunnusti itse, että häntä voitiin pitää »poliittisesti mielettömänä eikä tarpeeksi viisaana.» On vaarallista jännittää kansan kaikki jouset, panna se huohottamaan määrätyn teon odotusta, nostaa käsi määräyksen antoon ja sitten, kun kauhea kone jo järisee, kolme kertaa se pysähdyttää. On vaara, että ratastot kuluvat ja into katkeaa.
U||Kun Kongressin Komitea kokoontui Delhissä helmikuun 22 p:nä 1922, Gandhi sai suuren vastarinnan jälkeen hyväksytyksi Bardolissa 11 p:nä tehdyt päätökset. Syntyi skisma »pois yhteistoiminta»-miesten kesken. Gandhi tahtoi järjestäydyttävän ankarammin, ennenkuin ryhdyttiin toimiin; ja hän esitti järjestelysuunnitelman. Mutta moni vihastui tästä hitaudesta, pani vastalauseen kapinamääräyksen lykkäämistä vastaan ja väitti, että maan into näin tukahdutettiin. Osa halusi äänestää sensuuria toimeenpanevalle komitealle ja esitti komitean määräykset peruutettaviksi. Gandhi pääsi kuitenkin voitolle. Mutta hän kärsi syvästi. Eipä enemmistökään, joka häntä laumana seurasi, tuottanut hänelle paljoa iloa. Hän tunsi, ettei se ollut vilpitön. Ja usea hänen puolestaan äänestänyt kutsui häntä »diktaattoriksi». Pohjaltaan hän tunsi olevansa eri mieltä maansa kanssa. Hän sanoo sen uljaalla suoruudellaan maaliskuun 2 p:nä 1922:
U||»Enemmistössä on niin paljon peitettyjä väkivaltavirtauksia, tietoisia tai tiedottomia, että olen rukoillut onnettoman häviön puolesta. Olen aina ollut vähemmistössä. Etelä-Afrikassa aloin yksimielisyydellä, vajosin 64 hengen, jopa 16:n vähemmistöön ja nousin uudelleen suunnattomaan enemmistöön. Parhain ja vakavin työ tehtiin vähemmistön erämaassa… Pelkään enemmistöä. Minua ellottaa arvostelemattoman joukon ihailu. Tuntisin maan vankemmaksi jalkaini alla, jos he sylkisivät päälleni… Eräs ystäväni kielsi minua väärin käyttämästä diktatuuriani… Kaukana siitä, että olisin sitä tehnyt, kysyn pikemmin, enkö itse itseäni salli »väärinkäyttää»! Tunnustan pelkääväni sitä enemmän kuin koskaan. Ainoa pelastukseni on häpeämättömyydessäni. Olen ilmoittanut ystävilleni Kongressissa olevani parantumaton. Joka kerta, kun kansa tekee hairahduksia, tulen heitä jatkuvasti ripittämään. Ainoa tyranni, jonka tunnustan tässä maailmassa, on sisällämme oleva
U|| omantunnon ääni (the still small voice). Ja vaikka minun pitäisi nähdä edessäni yhden ainoan hengen vähemmistö, minulla olisi kuitenkin rohkeutta kuulua tähän epätoivoiseen vähemmistöön. Se on ainoa vilpitön puolue. Olen tänään surullisempi ja luullakseni viisaampi ihminen. Näen, että »pois väkivalta» -aatteemme on vain pölyä. Palamme harmista. Hallitus vain lisää tulta mielettömillä teoillaan. Voisi melkein sanoa sen haluavan nähdä tämän maan murhien, tulipalojen, ryöstöjen raatelemana voidakseen väittää, että se yksin kykenee ne sammuttamaan. »Pois väkivalta»-liikkeemme on mielestäni syntynyt heikkoudestamme: ikäänkuin sydämissämme hyväilisimme halua kostaa heti kun siihen olisi tilaisuutta. Voiko vapaaehtoinen »Pois väkivalta» nousta tästä heikkojen pakotetusta »Pois väkivallasta?» Eikö nykyhetken harrastukseni ole vain turhaa kokeilua?… Ja jos raivon puhjetessa yksikään ei jäisi syrjään, jos jokaisen käsi nousisi lähimmäistään vastaan,
U|| mitä hyödyttäisi silloin, että minä paastoan, kuollakseni sellaisen onnettomuuden jälkeen?… Jollette kykene »pois väkivaltaan», hyväksykää rehellisesti väkivalta! Mutta ei ulkokultaisuutta![83] Enemmistö vaatii »pois väkivalta» aatteen hyväksymistä… Tuntekoon se vastuunalaisuutensa! Sen pitää nyt lykätä siviilitottelemattomuus ja tehdä ensinnä rakentavaa työtä… Jollei, hukumme vesiin, joiden syvyyksiä emme aavista…»
U||Ja kääntyen vähemmistön puoleen hän sanoo sille:
U||»Te ette halua pois väkivaltaa»? Poistukaa Kongressista! Muodostakaa uusi puolue! Lausukaa julkisesti credonne! Valitkoon maa välillämme!… Mutta ei kaksimielisyyttä! Olkaa suorat!…»
U||Näissä nasevissa sanoissa on katkera, joskin miehekäs surumielisyys. Oli Olivipuistojen yö. Gandhin vangitseminen oli lähellä… Kuka tietää, vaikka hän sisimmässä sydämessään olisi ottanut tapauksen vastaan vapautuksena?…
U||Hän oli sitä odottanut jo kauan. Marraskuun 10:nnestä päivästä 1920 lähtien hän oli ryhtynyt kaikkiin varokeinoihin. Hän oli sanellut kansalle määräyksensä sen päivän varalta, jolloin hän ei enää olisi heidän keskellään (If I am arrested). Hän palaa siihen uudessa kirjoitelmassaan maaliskuun 9 p:ltä 1922, kun huhu hänen vangitsemisestaan alkoi levitä. Hän ei sano pelkäävänsä minkäänlaista hallituksen väkivaltaa. Hän pelkää vain yhtä seikkaa: kansan väkivaltaisuuksia. Ne häpäisisivät hänet. »Pitäköön kansa vangitsemisen! päivää ilon päivänä! Hallitus luulee, että Gandhin tultua vangituksi Intian asia on lopussa. Osoittakaa sille, että asianlaita on päinvastainen. Mitatkoon se kansan voiman!» Kaunein kunnianosoitus, minkä kansa voi hänelle antaa, on se, että se säilyttää täydellisen rauhan. Gandhia nöyryyttäisi ajatus, että hallitus epäröi hänen vangitsemistaan verisen nousun pelossa. Siis pysyköön kansa rauhallisena, älköön se jättäk
U|| työtään, älköön pitäkö kokouksia! Mutta sulkekoot oikeusistuimet ovensa, jätettäköön hallituksen palveluspaikat, viralliset koulut olkoot autiot, toteutukoon kokonaisuudessaan järjestyksen ja kurin vallitessa »pois väkivalta» -ohjelma! Jos kansa toimii näin, on sillä voitto. Jollei, se sortuu.
U||Kun kaikki oli valmista, lähti Gandhi rakkaaseen turvapaikkaansa Ašram de Sabarmatiin lähelle Ahmedabadia, siellä odottaakseen, ajatuksiaan kooten rakastettujen oppilaiden keskuudessa vangitsijainsa saapumista. Hän toivoi vankilaa. Hänen poissa ollessaan Intian usko ilmaantuisi paremmin. »Ja hän, hän löytäisi rauhan, jonka ehkä ansaitsi»…
U||Illalla maaliskuun 10 p:nä, vähän jälkeen rukouksen, poliisimiehet saapuivat. Ašramiin oli ilmoitettu heidän tulonsa. Mahatma antautui heidän käsiinsä. Matkalla vankeuteen hän tapasi Maulana Hasrat Mohanin, muhamettilaisen ystävänsä, joka riensi kaukaa saapuville juuri ajoissa häntä suudellakseen. Hänet saatettiin vankihuoneeseen Young Indian toimittajan Bankerin kanssa. Hänen vaimollaan oli lupa seurata häntä kynnykselle.
U||Lauantaina maaliskuun 18 p:nä kello kaksitoista alkoi »suuri prosessi»[84] Ahmedabadin aluetuomarin ja tuomioistuimen edessä. Se oli harvinaisen arvokas. Tuomari ja syytetty kilpailivat ritarillisessa kohteliaisuudessa. Ei koskaan Englanti ole noussut taistelussa jalomielisempään puolueettomuuteen. Tuomari, C.N. Broomsfield, sovitti tänä päivänä paljon hallituksen virheitä. Gandhin ystävien antama kertomus oikeudenkäynnistä julkaistiin osassa eurooppalaista sanomalehdistöä, ja huhut siitä saapuivat Ranskaan. Minä esitän sen siis ainoastaan lyhykäisesti.
U||Miksi hallitus oli päättänyt vangita Gandhin? Miten se oli kaksi vuotta epäröityään voinut valita hetken, jolloin Mahatma oli juuri suistanut kansansa kapinan ja näytti edelleenkin olevan väkivallan välttäjä? Oliko tämä hairahdus? Vai tahtoiko se vahvistaa Gandhin hirvittävän lauseen: »Hallitus näyttää tahtovan nähdä tämän maan murhien, tulipalojen ja ryöstöjen raatelemana, saadakseen syyn sitä masentaa!» — Todellisuudessa sen asema oli vaikea. Hallitus kunnioitti ja epäili Gandhia. Se olisi tahtonut häntä säästää; mutta Gandhi ei sitä puolestaan ollenkaan säästänyt. Mahatma paheksi väkivaltaa; mutta hänen »pois väkivalta» -liikkeensä oli vallankumouksellisempi kuin kaikki väkivalta. Niinä samoina päivinä, jolloin hän nousi joukkosiviilitottelemattomuutta vastaan, Delhin kongressin aattona, helmikuun 23 p:nä, hän oli julaissut yhden brittiläiselle vallalle uhkaavimmista artikkeleistaan. Lordi Birkenheadin ja Herra Montagun loukkaava sähkösanoma oli juu
U||ri antanut Intialle korvapuustin.[85] Gandhi oli harmin pakahduttamana nostanut uudestaan solvaisevan, taisteluvaatimuksen:
U||»Ei mitään sovittelua valtakunnan kanssa, niin kauan kuin brittiläinen leijona ravistaa kasvojemme edessä verisiä kynsiään!… Brittein valtakunta, joka on rakennettu maan ruumiillisesti heikompain heimojen järjestetylle hyväksikäyttämiselle ja raa'an voiman sovinnaiselle näytteilleasettamiselle, ei voi kestää, jos on olemassa oikeamielinen Jumala maailman kaikkeutta hallitsemassa. On jo koittanut aika, jolloin brittiläinen kansa käsittää vuonna 1920 aletuntaistelun olevan taistelua loppuun saakka, kestäköön se sitten kuukauden, vuoden, kuukausia tai vuosia… Rukoilen Jumalaa antamaan Intialle nöyryyttä ja tarpeeksi voimaa, jotta se jaksaisi kestää ilman väkivaltaa loppuun saakka. Mutta on mahdotonta alistua näihin julkeisiin taisteluvaatimuksiin…»
U||Syytös perustui tähän ja pariin uudempaan[86] kirjoitelmaan. Gandhia syytettiin siitä, »että hän oli kehoittanut nurjamielisyyteen, kiihoittanut vihaan ja yllyttänyt ylenkatsomaan lakien säätämää Hänen Majesteettinsa hallitusta.» Hänellä ei ollut ollenkaan puoltajia. Hän oli asiassa asianajajana ja samalla kaikkeen syyllisenä.
U||Yleinen asianajaja, sir J.T. Strangman Bombaysta, kannatti sitä, että syytöksen kolmea eri kohtaa ei käsiteltäisi erillisinä, vaan oleellisina osina jo kaksi vuotta hallitusta vastaan käydystä taistelusta, ja hän todisti sen lainauksilla. Hän myönsi Gandhin suuret avut. Se paha, minkä tällaiset kirjoitukset voivat aikaansaada, oli siitä syystä vain vakavampi. Hän pani Gandhin laskuun Bombayn ja Chauri-Chauran veriset tapahtumat. Epäilemättä Gandhi saarnasi »pois väkivaltaa», mutta samalla kertaa nurjamielisyyttä. Hän oli siis vastuussa rahvaan väkivallantöistä.
U||Gandhi pyysi sananvuoroa. Hänen omantunnontaistelunsa, hänen tuskansa, hänen viimeviikkoiset epäilynsä niiden ratkaisujen oikeudesta, joita hänen oli täytynyt tehdä, ja niistä heijastuksista, joita niillä täytyi olla hänen kansansa omaantuntoon, olivat häipyneet. Hän oli saanut takaisin sielunsa tyynen herruuden. Hän hyväksyi kaiken, mitä oli tapahtunut ja mitä vielä tapahtuisi välttämättömyydestä, josta hän ehkä voisi olla pahoillaankin, mutta jota hänen täytyi kantaa. — Hän selitti olevansa samaa mieltä yleisen asianajajan kanssa. Niin, hän oli vastuunalainen! Täydelleen vastuunalainen. Hän oli saarnannut nurjamielisyyttä jo paljon kauemmin aikaa kuin syyte sanoi. Se oli hänen intohimonsa. Hän otti päälleen kaiken solvauksen Madrasin levottomuuksista, Chauri-Cauran »pirulliset rikokset» ja Bombayn »mielettömät häväistykset»…
U||»Yleinen syyttäjä on oikeassa sanoessaan, että vastuunalaisena ihmisenä, koska olen saanut hyvän kasvatuksen osakseni ja saavuttanut suuren määrän tämän maailman kokemusta, minun olisi pitänyt tietää tekojeni seuraukset. Tiesin leikkiväni tulella. Olen antautunut vaaraan; ja jos minut vapautettaisiin, alkaisin uudestaan. Olen tämän kypsäksi harkinnut näinä viimeisinä öinä. Tunsin tänä aamuna, etten olisi tehnyt velvollisuuttani, jos olisin jättänyt sanomatta, minkä nyt juuri sanon. Koetin ja koetan välttää väkivaltaa. »Pois väkivalta» on uskoni ensimmäinen ja viimeinen pykälä. Mutta minun oli valittava; — joko alistua poliittiseen järjestelmään, joka mielestäni on tehnyt maalleni korjaamattoman vahingon, — tai uskaltaa ottaa vastaan kansani mieletön raivo, sen saadessa kuulla huuliltani totuuden. Tiedän kansani aina hetkittäin tulevan hulluksi. Olen siitä syvästi vihainen; ja siksi olen täällä alistuakseni, ei helppoon rangaistukseen, vaan kaikkein raskai
U||mpaan. En pyydä armoa, en esitä yhtään lieventävää asianhaaraa. Olen täällä pyytääkseni ja ilolla hyväksyäkseni suurimman vaivan, mikä voidaan määrätä sellaisesta asiasta, joka lain mukaan on harkittu rikos, mutta joka minusta itsestäni näyttää kansalaisen ensimmäiseltä velvollisuudelta. Tuomarit, teillä ei ole valintaa; erotkaa virastanne tai rangaiskaa minut!…»
U||Tämän voimallisen improvisation jälkeen, jossa olivat erinomaisesti tasapainossa uskonnollisen omantunnon punnitseminen ja poliittisen johtajan sankarillinen lujuus, Gandhi luki kirjoitetun, Intian ja Englannin yleisölle osoitetun lausunnon. Hän on yleisölle velkaa, sanoo hän, tiedoksiannon, »miksi lojaalisesta ja hartaasta brittiläisen hallituksen työkumppanista on tullut »epäsuosiollinen ja sovittamaton »pois yhteistoiminta» -mies. Hän kuvaa julkisen elämänsä vuodesta 1893 alkaen. Hän muistelee kaikkea, mitä hän on saanut kärsiä intialaisena brittiläisen järjestelmän puolelta, kaksikymmentäviisivuotisia ponnistuksiaan samaisen järjestelmän parantamiseksi, itsepäisesti kuvittelemalla tämän olevan mahdollista irroittamatta Intiaa valtakunnasta. Vuoteen 1919 saakka, huolimatta kaikista vastuksista, hän puolusti yhteistoimintaa, Mutta loukkaukset ja konnantyöt ovat menneet yli rajojen. Ja sen sijaan että hallitus olisi korjannut epäkohtia, on se kunnioittanut, eläkkeillä a
U||uttanut ja palkinnut syyllisiä Intian omaatuntoa mitä kipeimmin loukaten. Hallitus on itse katkonut siteet alaisiinsa. Siksi on Gandhi nyt tullut vakuutukseen, että Englannin ehdottamat parannuksetkin ovat kuolettavia Intialle. Hallitus nojaa kansanjoukkojen edukseen käyttämiseen. Laki on tehty tätä riistämistä varten. Lainkäyttö on saastutettu riistäjän palveluksessa. Terrorismin terävä ja tehokas järjestelmä on turmellut kansan ja opettanut sille teeskentelyn. Intia on perikatoon saatettu, nälkiintynyt, alennettu; ja jotkut ovat voineet lausua, että ennenkuin se kykenisi itse itseänsä hallitsemaan dominiona, sen tulisi kehittyä miespolvia. Ei yksikään menneisyydessä Intiaa sortanut hallitus ole tehnyt sille niin paljon pahaa kuin Englanti. »Pois yhteistoiminnan» rikollisuus on velvollisuus. Gandhi on sen velvollisuuden täyttänyt. Mutta sen sijaan, että tähän saakka väkivalta oli ylin turva, hän on antanut kansalleen korkeimman aseen: »pois väkivalta» -aatteen.
U||Tässä syntyy ritarillinen kamppailu tuomari Broomsfieldin ja Mahatman välillä:
U||— »Herra Gandhi, tunnustaessanne tekonne, te olette tehnyt tehtäväni jossain suhteessa mukavaksi. Mutta vaikeimpia asioita, mitä tuomari voi ottaa tehtäväkseen, on oikean tuomion määrääminen… On mahdotonta tekeytyä tietämättömäksi, että te olette miljoonain ihmisten silmissä suuri johtaja ja suuri isänmaanystävä. Nekin, jotka ovat toista mieltä kuin te politiikassa, pitävät teitä korkean ihanteen miehenä, jalona, jopa pyhänä elämältään… Mutta minun velvollisuuteni on teidät tuomita vain lainalaisena ihmisenä… Intiassa on luultavasti vähän henkilöitä, jotka eivät vilpittömästi valittaisi, että olette tehnyt hallitukselle mahdottomaksi jättää teidät vapauteen. Mutta näin on asianlaita… Koetan saada tasapainoon yleisen edun kanssa sen, minkä teille olemme velkaa…»
U||Kohteliaasti hän neuvottelee syytetyn kanssa rangaistuksesta, mikä tälle voitaisiin antaa. Hän ehdottaa Gandhille Tilakille kaksitoista vuotta sitten määrättyä tuomiota: kuusi vuotta vankeutta… »Älkää pitäkö sitä kohtuuttomana. Jos erinäisten tapausten kulku tekee mahdolliseksi lyhentää tätä aikaa, ei kukaan olisi siitä onnellisempi kuin minä…»
U||Gandhi ei jää jälkeen kohteliaisuudessa. Hän pitää ylpeimpänä kunnianaan nähdä nimensä yhdistetyksi Tilakin nimeen. Tuomio on kevein, minkä tuomari voi hänelle määrätä; ja koko oikeudenkäynnin osaksi hän ei voinut odottaa enempää huomaavaisuutta.[87]
U||Juttu oli lopussa. Gandhin ystävät heittäytyivät hänen jalkoihinsa nyyhkyttäen. Mahatma jätti heille hyvästit hymyillen. Ja Sabarmatin vankilan ovi sulkeutui hänen jälkeensä.[88]
U||V.
U||Senjälkeen on apostolin suuri ääni ollut vaiti. Hänen ruumiinsa on kuin muurattu hautaan. Mutta haudat eivät ole koskaan sulkeneet ajatusta. Ja hänen näkymätön sielunsa elähdyttää yhä jatkuvasti Intian ääretöntä ruumista. Rauha, »pois väkivalta» ja kärsimys ovat ainoat tiedonannot vankilasta.[89] Hänet on kuultu. Järjestyksen sana on kiitänyt maan äärestä toiseen. Kolme vuotta aikaisemmin olisi Gandhin vangitseminen aikaansaanut verenvuotoa Intiassa. Kun huhu siitä levisi maaliskuussa 1920, nousivat kansanjoukot. Ahmedabadin tuomion otti Intia vastaan uskonnollisesti vaieten. Tuhannet intialaiset antoivat vangita itsensä rauhallisen iloisina. »Pois väkivalta» ja kärsimys… Tämä oli erikoisena esimerkkinä siitä, miten syvälle kansan sieluun jumalallinen sana oli tunkeutunut.
U||Sikhit, kuten tiedetään, ovat aina olleet Intian sotaisimpia heimoja; heitä oli laumoittain palvellut sodan aikana sotaväessä. Viime vuoden kuluessa nousi vakava riita heidän keskuudessaan. Sen alkusyy oli mitätön (meidän eurooppalaisten silmissä). Uskonnollinen Sikh-renessanssi oli nostattanut Akali-lahkon, joka tahtoi puhdistaa pyhättöjä. Nämä pyhätöt olivat tulleet huonomaineisten vartijain elinkautisiksi paikoiksi, ja he kieltäytyivät edelleenkin muuttamasta niistä. Hallitus ryhtyi heitä puoltamaan laillisuussyistä. Silloin alkoi noin elokuussa 1922 Guru-Ka-Bagh'in[90] jokapäiväinen kärsimys. Akalit olivat omistaneet »pois väkivalta» -opin. Tuhat heistä asettautui pyhätön lähelle, neljä tuhatta Amritsarin Kultatemppeliin. Joka päivä sata vapaaehtoista (suurin osa sotapalvelusiässä, useat viime sodassa palvelleita) lähti Kultatemppelistä tehtyään lupauksen Jumalalle, etteivät käytä väkivaltaa töissä eikä sanoissa ja saavuttavat Guru-Ka-Baghin tai saa heidät
U|| muuten tiedottomina tuoda takaisin. Toisesta tuhannesta kaksikymmentä akalia teki saman lupauksen. Eräällä sillalla lähellä pyhättöä odotti brittiläinen poliisi pitkin rautapäisin seipäin. Ja joka päivä kehittyi harhalta näyttävä näky, jota meille kuvaa Andrewsin, Santiniketanin professorin ja Tagoren ystävän unohtumaton kertomus.[91] Akalit, päässä musta turbaani, jota koristi pieni valkokukkainen kiehkura, saapuivat poliisijoukon vastapäätä ja seisahtuivat metrin päähän rukousasentoon hiljaisina, liikkumattomina. Poliisit lyövät heitä ankarasti pitkillä kepeillään. Sikhit kierivät maassa, nousevat uudelleen ylös, jos voivat, alkavat uudelleen; uudelleen heitä lyödään, joskus poljetaan siksi kunnes he menettävät tajuntansa. Andrews ei kuule huutoakaan, ei huomaa yhtään uhmakatsetta. Ympärillä jonkun matkan päässä satakunta katselijaa, kasvot tuskasta jännittyneinä, rukoilee hiljaa, ihailun ja kärsimyksen ilmein.
U||»He muistuttivat minulle», sanoo Andrews, »Ristin varjoa.» Englantilaiset, jotka kertovat tästä näytöksestä sanomalehdissään, ihmettelevät ymmärtämättä mitään, toteavat vastenmielisesti, että mieletön uhrautuminen on loistava voitto »pois väkivalta» -liikkeen armeijalle ja että Punjabin väestö on sen lumoama. Mutta ylevämielinen Andrews, jonka puhdas ihanteellisuus on oppinut lukemaan Intian sielua, on tässä nähnyt, kuten Goethe Valmyssa, uuden aikakauden alun: »uusi sankaruus, kärsimyksen opettama, on noussut tämän maan päälle; uusi hengen sota…»
U||Kansa itse näyttää paremmin säilyttäneen Mahatman ajatuksen kuin ne, jotka olivat saaneet toimekseen olla opastajia. Muistamme oppositioina, joka oli ilmennyt Delhin kongressin komiteassa kaksikymmentä päivää ennen Mestarin vangitsemista. Se uudistui, kun kongressin komitea kokoontui uudelleen Lucknowissa kesäkuun 7 p:nä 1922. Vallitsi suuri tyytymättömyys Gandhin määräämään kärsivällisen rakentamisen ja odotuksen ohjelmaan nähden; halu siirtyä tästä siviilitottelemattomuuteen vahvistui. Asetettiin tutkimuskomissioni tarkastamaan, oliko maa riittävästi valmis tottelemattomuuteen. Komissioni kulki ympäri Intian; ja sen syksyllä antama tiedonanto oli masentava: se ei ainoastaan väittänyt, että tottelemattomuus oli sillä kertaa mahdoton, vaan puolet jäsenistä (miehiä koetelluin uskoin) tahtoi luovuttavan itse »pois väkivalta» -liikkeen gandhilaisista menetelmistäkin, poliittisten virkojen vieromisesta, ja että Swarâj-(Home Rule)-puolue muodostuisi hallituksen neuvostoje
U||n helmassa, lyhyesti, että »pois väkivalta» -liikkeestä tulisi itse asiassa parlamentaarinen oppositsioni. Täten Gandhin opin olivat rikkoneet toiselta puolen väkivaltaiset, toiselta pidättyvät.
U||Mutta Intia pani vastaan. Intian kansalliskongressi vuotuisessa kokouksessaan Gayassa joulukuun lopulla 1922 vahvisti uudelleen painavasti uskollisuutensa vainottua Johtajaa kohtaan ja uskonsa »pois väkivalta» -oppiin. 1740 äänellä 890:tä vastaan se hylkäsi ehdotuksen osanotosta lakiasäätäviin neuvostoihin.[92] Ja lopuksi päästiin uudelleen yksimielisyyteen poliittisen lakon jatkamisesta vain pienin yksityiskohtaisin poikkeuksin menetelmissä. Hyljättiin ainoastaan ehdotus kaikkien englantilaisten kauppatavarani hylkimisestä, viisaasti kylläkin huolehtien siitä, ettei herätettäisi eurooppalaisten työntekijäin vastustusta. Aina rohkeampi Khilafatin moslemien konferenssi oli äänestänyt tämän hylkimisen puolesta suurella enemmistöllä.
U||Tässä historiankohdassa meidän tulee keskeyttää kertomuksemme gandhilaisten suuresta liikkeestä. Huolimatta muutamista myönnytyksistä joita ei voitu välttää mestarin ja hänen parhaimpien oppilaittensa, varapäällikköjen (erittäin Ali-veljesten), vangittujen kuten hänkin, poissa ollessa, se on kestänyt voitollisesti ensimmäisen opasta vailla vierineen vuoden epäilyttävän koetuksen. Ja englantilaisten lehtien tunnustama pettymys Gayan kongressin jälkeen osoittaa, miten tärkeä tämä voitto oli.[93]
U||Mitä tästä tulee lopulta? Eikö Englanti menneiden virheiden opettamana osoittaudu taitavammaksi kansan innon hillitsijäksi? Eikö tämän kansan järkähtämättömyys väsy? Kansoilla on vähän muistia; ja epäilen kovasti, säilyttääkö Intian miesten muisti kovinkaan kauan Mahatman opetuksia, elleivät ne ole olleet jo kauan aikaa sitten kirjoitetut heimon sisimpään. Sillä jos nero on ainoastaan suuruutensa takia suuri, olkoonpa sitten tai ei ympäristönsä kanssa sopusoinnussa, hän on toiminnan nero vain rotunsa vaistojen, aikansa tarpeiden ja maailman odotusten ilmaisijana.
U||Sellainen on Mahatma Gandhi. Hänen Ahimsâ (»Pois väkivalta») periaatteensa oli uurrettu Intian sydämeen jo kaksituhatta vuotta sitten: Mahâvira, Buddha ja Višnu-kultti olivat olleet näiden miljoonien sielujen olemuksena. Gandhi on siihen ainoastaan vuodattanut sankarillisen verensä. Hän loihtii esiin jättiläisvarjoja, menneisyyden voimia, jotka olivat jo jäykistyneet ja vaipuneet kuoleman horrokseen. Ja hänen äänestään ne ovat nousseet. Sillä ne tuntevat itsensä hänessä. Hän on enemmän kuin sanat, hän on esimerkki. Hän on heidät ruumiillistuttanut. Onnellinen mies, joka on koko kansa, — hänen hautaan pantu kansansa ylösnousee hänessä!
U||Mutta nämä ylösnousemukset eivät koskaan tapahdu sattumalta. Ja jos Intian henki nousee sen temppeleistä ja sen metsistä, merkitsee tämä, että se tuo maailmaan edeltä määrätyn vastauksen, jota maailma odotti.
U||* * * * *
U||Vastaus on tosiaankin ihmeellisempi Intiaa. Ainoastaan Intia on voinut sen antaa. Mutta se sisältää maalle yhtä paljon suuruutta kuin kärsimystä. Siitä on vähältä tulla sen risti.
U||Näyttää siltä, että yhden kansan on aina uhrauduttava, jotta maailma uudistuisi. Juutalaiset uhrattiin Messiakselle, jota he vuosisatoja toiveillaan kannatettuaan ja elätettyään eivät tunnustaneet, kun hänet vihdoin verisellä ristillä kruunattiin. Onnellisemmat intialaiset, jotka ovat omansa tunteneet! Ja he menevät iloisesti uhraukseen, joka heidät vapauttaa.
U||Mutta kaikki eivät ymmärrä tämän vapautuksen todellista luonnetta kuten ensimmäiset kristityt. Kauan nämä odottivat maassaan adveniat regnum tuum. Suuren osan toiveet Intiassa eivät näe kauemmaksi kuin että Svarâj hallitsisi Intiaa. Ja minun luullakseni tämä poliittinen ihanne saavutetaan pian. Sotien ja vallankumouksien runtelema, köyhtynyt ja väsynyt Eurooppa, jolta arvovalta on riistetty sen sortaman Aasian silmissä, ei enää kauan kykene olemaan Aasian kamaralla heränneitten Islamin, Intian, Kiinan ja Japanin kansojen johtajana.
U||Mutta merkitsisi vähän se, että joitakin kansoja tulisi lisää, — niin rikkaat kuin ihmissinfoniaa täydentävät uudet soinnut voisivatkin olla, — tuo merkitsisi vähän, elleivät nämä Aasian voimat olisi vaikuttimena uuteen elämän ja kuoleman ymmärrykseen ja (mikä eniten merkitsee!) ymmärrykseen työskennellä koko ihmiskunnan hyväksi, elleivät ne toisi uupuneelle Euroopalle uutta evästä.
U||Väkivallan tuuli on laassut maailmaa. Tässä rajuilmassa, joka hävittää sivistyksemme laihot, ei ole mitään odottamatonta. Vuosisatojen raa'an vallankumouksen epäjumalaisen aatteellisuuden kiihoittaman, kansan valtojen sokean apinoinnin levittämän kansallisen ylpeyden, — ja huippuna: epäinhimillisen industrialismin ja ahneen rahavallan vuosisadan, orjuuttavan koneellisuuden, taloudellisen materialismin, jossa sielu kuolee tukahtuen, — täytyi tietysti viedä näihin kohtalokkaihin myllerryksiin, joissa Lännen aarteet häviävät. Ei ole kyllin sanoa, että tämä oli tarpeen vaatimaa. Tässä on kohtalon sormi. Jokainen kansa syöksee turmioon toisen kansan samojen periaatteiden nimessä, jotka ohjasivat Kainin pyrkimyksiä ja vaistoja. Kaikki, — niin natsionalistit, fascistit kuin bolsevikit, niin sorretut kansat ja luokat kuin sortajakansat ja -luokatkin, — vaativat itselleen, kieltäen sen muilta, oikeutta väkivaltaan, joka niistä näyttää oikeudelta. Puoli vuosisataa sitten voima 
U||kävi ennen oikeutta. Nykyhetkellä on asia pahempi: voima on oikeus. Se on sen niellyt. Tässä vanhassa vierivässä maailmassa ei ole mitään turvaa, mitään toivoa. Ei yhtään suurta valoa. Kirkko antaa annoksittain typeriä hyveellisiä neuvoja, varovaisesti valvoen, ettei se joutuisi eripuraisuuteen mahtavien kanssa; muuten se vain neuvoo, antamatta itse esimerkkiä. Laimeat rauhanmiehet määkivät toivovasti, ja ihminen tuntee, että he epäröivät; he puhuvat uskosta, jonka omistamisesta he eivät ole varmoja. Kuka koettelisi tätä heidän uskoaan? Ja kuinka, keskellä tätä maailmaa, joka sen kieltää? — Millä sitten usko itsensä todistaa? Toiminnalla!
U||Tässä Sanoma maailmalle, kuten Gandhi sitä nimittää, Intian sanoma:
U||»Uhrautukaamme!»
U||Ja Tagore on sen toistanut lumoavin sanoin, sillä tässä ylpeässä periaatteessa Tagore ja Gandhi ovat yhtä mieltä!
U||»… Toivon voimakkaana kasvavan tämän uhrautumishengen, tämän suostumuksen kärsimykseen. Se on oikeata vapautta… Ei yksikään arvo ole korkeampi, — ei edes kansallinen riippumattomuus… Lännellä on järkkymätön uskonsa voimaan ja aineelliseen rikkauteen: huutakoon se siis rauhan ja aseistariisumisen puolesta, sen julmuus on muriseva aina vain kovemmin. Se on kuin kala, jota haavoittaa veden puristus ja joka tahtoisi lentää: loistava ajatus! Mutta aivan mahdoton kalan toteuttaa. Meidän, intialaisten on näytettävä maailmalle, mikä on totuus, joka ei tee ainoastaan mahdolliseksi aseista riisumista, vaan muuttaa sen voimaksi. Se, että siveellinen voima on suurempi raakaa voimaa, on aseettoman kansan todistettava. Elämän kehitys osoittaa, että se on vähitellen heittänyt hirvittävän aseiden taakan ja kauhean lihajoukon, siihen päivään saakka, jolloin ihmisestä on tullut raa'an maailman valloittaja. Tulee päivä, jolloin heikko, täydellisesti aseista vapaa sydämen-ihminen osoi
U||ttaa, että lempeät ovat maan perijät. On siis johdonmukaista, että ruumiiltaan heikko ja kaikkia aineellisia lähteitä vailla oleva Mahatma Gandhi herättää lempeiden ja nöyrien äärettömän voiman, joka odottaa loukatun ja sivuutetun Intian inhimillisyyden sydämen kätköissä. Intian kohtalot ovat valinneet liittolaiseksi Nârâyanan, eikä Nârâyani-senâa, sielun voiman, eikä lihaksen voimaa. Sen tulee kohottaa ihmishistoria aineellisen sekamelskan likaiselta tasolta hengen taistojen huipuille… Vaikka Lännestä oppimamme lauseet johtaisivat meidät harhaan, Swarâj (Home Rule) ei ole päämäärämme. Meidän taistelumme on henkistä taistelua. Se on taistelua Ihmisen puolesta. Meidän tulee vapauttaa ihminen niistä verkoista, joita se on ympärilleen kutonut, kansallisen itsekkyyden järjestöistä. Meidän tulee vakuuttaa perhoselle, että taivaan vapaus on suurempiarvoinen kuin kotelon suoja… Meidän kielestämme puuttuu kansallisuutta merkitsevä sana. Kun lainaamme tämän sanan m
U||uilta kansoilta, niin ei se meille ollenkaan sovi, sillä meidän tulee liittyä Nârâyanaan, korkeimpaan olentoon; ja meidän voittomme ei anna meille muuta kuin voiton Jumalan maailmalle… Jos voimme uhmata voimakkaita, rikkaita, aseita, paljastaen maailmalle kuolemattoman hengen voiman, syöksyisi Lihan jättiläisen koko linna tyhjyyteen. Ja silloin ihminen löytäisi todellisen Swarâjin. Me, Idän ryysyiset kerjäläiset, me valloitamme vapauden koko ihmiskunnalle…»
U||Oi, Tagore, Gandhi, Intian virrat, jotka Induksen ja Gangeksen kaltaisina suljette kaksoissyleilyynne Idän ja Lännen, — toinen sankarillisen toiminnan murhenäytelmä, toinen laaja valon unelma, — molemmatkin Jumalasta virraten, levittäkää hänen kylvöään väkivallan auran kyntämän maailman ylle!
U||* * * * *
U||»Meidän taistelumme saavutuksena», selittää Gandhi, »on ystävyys koko maailman kanssa. »Pois väkivalta» on saapunut ihmisten keskeen, ja se pysyy. Se on maailmanrauhan julistaja…»
U||Maailmanrauha on kaukana. Meillä ei ole harhakuvia. Olemme runsaasti nähneet puolen vuosisadan kuluessa ihmisen valheita, ilkeyksiä ja raakuuksia. Tämä ei silti ollenkaan estä sitä rakastamasta. Sillä huonoimmallakin on jotain nescio quid Dei… Me tunnemme sen aineellisen kohtalokkuuden, joka lepää raskaana XX vuosisadan Euroopan yllä, Euroopan, jota puristavat taloudellisten ehtojen murskaava determinismi ja intohimojen sekä kivettyneiden erheiden vuosisadat, jotka muodostavat aikamme sielujen ympärille kovan, valoa päästämättömän kuoren. Mutta me tunnemme myöskin hengen ihmeet. Historioitsija, me olemme nähneet näiden ihmeiden salamain läpäisevän paljon pimeämpiä taivaita kuin meidän. Erinäisinä hetkinä me kuulemme Intiassa Šivan rummun: »Mestari-tanssija peittää hurjan katseensa ja ohjaa askelensa pelastaakseen kuilusta maailmankaikkeuden»…[94]
U||Väkivallan (vallankumouksellisen tai taantumuksellisen) realipoliitikot pilkkaavat tätä uskoa ja he osoittavat täten tietämättömyyttään syvistä totuuksista. Pilkatkoot! Minulla on tämä usko. Näen sitä Euroopassa solvattavan ja vainottavan; ja omassa maassa meitä on kourallinen… (Onko meitä korallistakaan?…) Mutta vaikka uskoisin aivan yksin, välipä siitä? Uskon ominaisuus on — kaukana maailman vihamielisyyden kieltämisestä — nähdä tämä vihamielisyys ja uskoa kuitenkin, sen uhalla, mikä on vielä parempi! Sillä usko on taistelua. Ja meidän »pois väkivalta» -aatteemme on raskainta taistelua. Rauhan tie ei ole heikkouden tie. Vihaamme enemmän heikkoutta kuin väkivaltaa. Ei mikään tule arvoonsa ilman voimaa; ei paha eikä hyvä. Ja enemmän arvoinen on täydellinen paha kuin salvettu hyvä. Voihkiva rauhanaate on rauhalle kuolettava: se on pelkuruutta ja uskon puutetta. Ne, jotka eivät usko tai jotka pelkäävät, peräytykööt! Rauhan tie on itsensä uhrausta.
U||Tämä on Gandhin opetus.[95] Siltä puuttuu vain Risti. Jokainen tietää, että ilman juutalaisia Rooma olisi sen kieltänyt Kristukselta. Ja brittiläinen valtakunta on Rooman valtakunnan veroinen. Mutta into on annettu. Idän kansojen sielua on se liikuttanut syvyyksiä myöten, ja sen värähtelyt leviävät yli koko maan.
U||Suurilla uskonnollisilla ilmiöillä Idässä on rytminsä. Tapahtuu jompikumpi kahdesta: joko Gandhin ilmiö voittaa tai se toistuu, — kuten ovat toistuneet vuosisatoja ennen Messias ja Buddha — kuolevaisena puolijumalana täydelliseen lihaksitulemiseen saakka, mikä vie uuden ihmiskunnan uuteen levähdyspaikkaan.
U||Helmikuussa 1923.
U||Viiteselitykset:
1||Intian kansan Gandhille antama nimi merkitsee kirjaimellisesti: Mahâ, suuri, Atmâ, sielu. Sana on peräisin Upanišadeista, jossa se merkitsee korkeinta olentoa sekä — tiedon ja rakkauden sopusoinnun kautta — niitä, jotka yhtyvät häneen.
U||    Se on loistava yksilö, Kaiken Luoja, Mahâtmâ,
U||    Aina kansojen sydämissä asuva,
U||    Sydämen, välittömän näkemyksen ja järjen ilmentämä.
U||    Ken sen tuntee, saa kuolemattomuuden.
U||Tagore lainasi nämä kauniit säkeet kohdistaen ne tähän apostoliin käydessään joulukuussa 1922 Ašramissa (Gandhin mieluisin oleskelupaikka).
2||C.-F. Andrews lisää: »Hän nauraa kuin lapsi ja ihailee lapsia.»
3||»Harvat ihmiset voivat vastustaa hänen olemuksensa tenhoa. Hänen suuri kohteliaisuutensa on lauhduttanut ankarimmatkin vastustajat.» (Joseph J. Doke.)
4||»Kaikki poikkeaminen totuudesta, vaikkapa vain ohimennen, on hänelle sietämätöntä.» (C.-F. Andrews).
5||»Hän ei ole intohimoinen kaunopuhuja, hänen tapansa puhua on rauhallinen ja hidas; hän vetoo etupäässä järkeen. Mutta hänen rauhallisuutensa luo asioihin mitä selkeimmän valon. Hänen äänensä vivahteet ovat vähäiset, mutta ehdottoman välittömät. Hän ei liikehdi koskaan käsillään, liikuttaa harvoin sormiaankaan puhuessaan. Hänen selkeät sanansa, jotka soinnahtavat pontevin mietelauselmin, vakuuttavat. Hän ei hellitä rahtuakaan ennenkuin varmasti tietää tulleensa ymmärretyksi.» (Joseph J. Doke).
6||Young India, maalisk. 2:sena 1922. (Tämän tutkielman sivujen alle merkityt päivämäärät tarkoittavat Gandhin Young Indiassa julkaisemia kirjoitelmia).
7||Samoin.
8||A: kieltopartikkeli; Himsâ: tehdä pahaa. Siis: ei milloinkaan herjausta eikä väkivaltaa. »Väkivallan välttäminen on hindu-uskontojen vanhimpia periaatteita, niinkuin eritoten Mahâvira, džainalaisuuden perustaja, ja Buddha sekä Višnun palveluksen mestarit ovat todistaneet, ja se oli suuresti vaikuttanut Gandhiin.
9||Hän opiskeli seitsemänteen ikävuoteen saakka Porbandarin alkeiskoulussa, sitten Radškotin keskikoulussa; kymmenvuotiaasta alkaen Kathiavarin korkeakoulussa, vihdoin 17 vuoden vanhasta Ahmedabadin yliopistossa.
U||[10] Hän on tuttavallisessa muodossa kuvannut lapsuuttansa Intian halveksittujen luokkien (paariain) konferenssissa huhtikuun 13 p:nä 1921.
U||[11] Myöhemmin hän puhui näistä kauhuista Joseph J. Dokelle; hän oli menettänyt sentakia unensa; hän piti itseään murhaajana.
U||[12] Kihloissa kahdeksanvuotiaana, naimisissa kahdentoista. Sittemmin hän taisteli lapsiavioliittoja vastaan, joissa hän näki syyn ihmisen perikatoon. Kuitenkin, hän lisää, poikkeuksellisesti sellainen elämänliitto, joka on alettu ennen luonteen muodostumista, voi saada aikaan puolisoiden kesken ihmeellisen sielujen yhteyden. Hänen oma avioliittonsa oli ollut ihailtava esimerkki siitä. Rouva Gandhi on jakanut kaikki miehensä koettelemukset osoittaen uskollisuutta ja rohkeutta, jotka eivät koskaan ole pettäneet.
U||[13] Esitelmä huhtikuun 13 p:nä 1921.
U||[14] Hänen edelläkävijänsä, joitten poliittista rohkeutta on ylistetty, ovat saaneet osakseen kiittämättömyyttä ja unhoa myöhempien sukupolvien puolelta. Mutta Gandhi on pysynyt heille uskollisena, etenkin Gokhalelle, johon hän oli hellästi kiintynyt. Useat kerrat kehoittaa hän nuorta Intiaa kunnioittamaan tätä sekä Dadabhaita.
U||[15] Hän ansaitsi, sanoo Gokhale, 5—6,000 puntaa vuodessa Myöhemmin hän eli kolmella punnalla kuukaudessa.
U||[16] The Golden Number of Indian Opinion, joka ilmestyi Phoenixissä v. 1914, julkaisi Tolstoin vähän ennen kuolemaansa Gandhille kirjoittaman pitkän kirjeen. Tolstoi oli lukenut Indian Opinionia ja iloinnut siitä, mitä sai tietää intialaisista »pois vastarinta»-aatteen kannattajista. Hän rohkaisee liikettä ja sanoo, että »pois vastarinta» on rakkauden laki, toisin sanoen, ihmissielujen pyrkimystä uskonyhteyteen. Se on Kristuksen ja koko maailman viisaiden julistama laki.
U||Ystävämme Birjukoff on löytänyt Tolstoi-arkistossa Moskovassa toisia
U||Tolstoin kirjeitä Gandhille. Hän julkaisee ne, samalla kuin muut
U||Tolstoin kirjeet aasialaisille, yleisellä nimellä: Tolstoi ja Itä.
U||[17] Hän on itse rauhallisen hyväntahtoisesti kertonut vankilakokemuksistaan erinomaisessa artikkelissaan, joka on painettu kirjassa: Speeches and writings of M.K. Gandhi, Natesan, Madras, sivut 152—178.
U||[18] V. 1907 hänen omat kansalaisensa: hänen tuli samalla kertaa kärsiä sekä sortajain että sorrettujen väkivaltaa; ja viimemainittujen mielestä Gandhin sovittelupyrkimys oli epäilyttävää ja hallitus teki voitavansa häntä soivatakseen.
U||[19] Palaan tähän myöhemmin.
U||[20] Joseph J. Doke, jonka keskustelut Gandhin kanssa Transvaalissa ovat niin valaisevat, lopettaa kirjansa kuvauksella Gandhista, miten hänet vangin puvussa vietiin Johannesburgin linnaan ja heitettiin pimeään vankityrmään yhteen inhoittavain kiinalaisten rikollisten kanssa.
U||[21] Kahden vaikutusvaltaisen englantilaisen C.-F. Andrews'in ja W.W. Pearsonin väliintulo auttoi tehokkaasti Gandhin ponnistuksia.
U||[22] Gandhi muistelee tapausta kirjoitelmassaan toukokuun 12 p:ltä 1920.
U||[23] Hänen rakastettu mestarinsa Gokhale, joka oli juuri kuollut, oli saanut hänet lupautumaan olemaan sekaantumatta vaikuttavaan politiikkaan, ennenkuin hän olisi vähintään yhden vuoden ajan kulkenut ympäri Intiaa ja nähnyt läheltä kansaansa, jonka kanssa hän oli kadottanut yhteyden.
U||[24] Satyâgraha -liikkeen voi laskea alkaneen helmikuun 28 p:nä 1919.
U||[25] Hän on suoraan lausunut tuomitsevan mielipiteensä bolševismista. (24 p. marrask. 1921).
U||[26] 11 p. elok. 1920. Gandhi asettuu tässä vastustamaan »Miekan oppia».
U||[27] Ihmiskunta on yksi. On rotueroavaisuuksia, mutta mitä korkeammalle rotu on kehittynyt, sitä suuremmat ovat sen velvollisuudet.» (Ethical Religion).
U||[28] Marraskuun 5 p:nä 1919.
U||[29] Lokakuun 27 p:nä 1920.
U||[30] Heinäkuussa 1920. — »Minun uskoni ei vaadi minua pitämään pyhien runojen kaikkia säkeitä jumalaisen innostuksen tuotteina. Minä en tahdo olla sidottu mihinkään tulkintaan, olipa se vaikka kuinka korkeaa oppia, jos se on ristiriidassa järjen ja siveellisen tunteen kanssa…» (lokakuun 6 p:nä 1921.)
U||[31] Samaten. — »Kaikki uskonnot ovat eri teitä, jotka vievät samaan päämäärään». (Hind Swaràj) — »Kaikki uskonnot ovat perustetut samoille siveyslaeille. Minun siveellinen uskontoni on kokoonpantu laeista, jotka yhdistävät kaikki maailman ihmiset.» (Ethical Religion).
U||[32] Lokakuun 6 p:nä 1921.
U||[33] Etymologisesti: Varna: väri, luokka tai kasti, ašrama: kurinpidon paikka; dharma: uskonto. Yhteiskunta esitetään luokkien kurinpitolaitoksena. Se on hindulaisuuden perustus.
U||[34] »Etsikää taivaan valtakuntaa ja totuutta, niin kaikki muu teille annetaan.»
U||[35] Young India, 25 p. helmik. 1920.
U||[36] Joseph J. Dokelle v. 1908.
U||[37] Hän sanoo vielä Joseph J. Dokelle: »Jumala on tullut lihaksi eri muodoissa aikojen kuluessa. Gĩtâssa Krišna sanoo: Kun uskonto vaipuu rappiotilaan, kun uskonnottomuus voittaa, silloin ilmoitan itseni. Hyvän suojaamiseksi, pahan hävittämiseksi, Dharman vahvistamiseksi minä synnyn uudestaan iankaikkisesti.
U||»Kristinusko on osa jumaluusopistani. Kristus on jumaluuden loistava ilmaantuminen. Mutta ei ainoa ilmaantumismuoto. En näe häntä yksinään valtaistuimella…»
U||[38] Kasteista 8 p:ltä jouluk. 1920, 6 p:ltä lokak. 1921. — Kun vuosien kuluessa alkuperäiset luokat kivettyivät ylpeiksi kasteiksi, Upanišadit nostivat vastalauseensa.
U||[39] Ei pidä unohtaa, että Gandhin pääasiallisimmat hyökkäykset Euroopan lääketiedettä vastaan aiheutti tämän lääketieteen turvautuminen vivisektsioniin (elävien eläinten kokeiluleikkelemiseen), »tähän ihmisten kaikkein mustimpaan rikokseen.»
U||[40] Etenkin sukupuolisuhteita koskevissa kysymyksissä hänen ankara oppinsa muistuttaa paljon apostoli Paavalin elämänkatsomusta.
U||[41] Gandhi koettaa, eurooppalaisen tieteen osoittautuessa vajavaksi, teroittaa tieteellisten tutkimusten tarpeellisuutta ja ehdotonta tarkkuutta. Hän ihailee eurooppalaisten tieteilijäin intoa ja uhrautuvaisuutta, jota hän usein pitää uskovaisten hindujen vastaavia ominaisuuksia korkeampana. Hän kunnioittaa henkeä; hän vieroo vain sitä tietä, minkä se on valinnut. Tällaisin rajoituksin pysyy hän kuitenkin vastustavalla kannalla. Ja tämän takia Tagore, kuten tulemme näkemään, kohottaa äänensä Gandhin keskiaikaisuutta vastaan.
U||[42] Viides maapallon kansoista.
U||[43] Etymologia: Swa: »Self», itse; Râj: hallitus, autonomia. Sana on yhtä vanha kuin Vedat; mutta Dadabhai, Gandhin parsi-opettaja, otti sen uudelleen valtiolliseen sanakirjaansa.
U||[44] Etymologia: Satya: tarkka, oikea; Agraha: yritys, koe; oikea koe. Sitä sovitettiin etenkin vääryyttä torjuttaessa. Gandhi määrittelee sen (marraskuun 5 p:nä 1919) seuraavasti »Totuudessa pysyminen; totuuden voima; rakkauden voima tai sielunvoima;» ja vihdoin: »totuuden voitto sielun ja rakkauden voimin.»
U||[45] Elokuun 11 p:nä 1920. Yksi Gandhin perustaman Satyâgraha Ašram-nimisen koulun noudatettava sääntö on pelottomuus, »sielun on oltava vapaa kuningasten, kansojen, kastien, perhesuhteiden, ihmisten, villipetojen, kuoleman pelosta.»
U||Se on myöskin väkivallattoman vastarinnan neljäs ehto Hind Swarâjssa.
U||(Kolme muuta ehtoa ovat: siveys, köyhyys, totuus.)
U||[46] Vielä muutamia kuukausia ennen vangitsemistaan Gandhi vastaa voimakkaisiin soimauksiin, jotka häneen suunnattiin hänen politiikkansa epäjohdonmukaisuuden takia. Muistellaan ivallisesti apua, jonka hän on antanut Englannille Etelä-Afrikassa ja maailmansodan aikaan. Toistaiseksi hän ei kiellä mitään kohtaa entisessä käytöksessään. Hän luuli rehellisesti, hän sanoo, olleensa valtakunnan kansalainen, hänen asiansa ei ollut tuomita hallitusta; hänestä olisi kiusallista, jos jokainen tekisi itsestään hallituksen tuomarin. Hän on luottanut englantilaiseen älykkyyteen ja rehellisyyteen niin kauan kuin on voinut. Hallituksen hairahdus vei häneltä luottamuksen. Kanta- koon hallitus siitä vastuun (marraskuun 17 p:nä 1921.)
U||[47] Se tekee pahinta jälkeä. Se alentaa sen, joka sitä käyttää. Liittoutuneiden väkivallasta Saksaa kohtaan, sanoo Gandhi, on ollut tuloksena se, että he ovat tulleet saksalaisten kaltaisiksi, joiden töitä he mustasivat sodan alussa (kesäkuun 9 p:nä 1920).
U||[48] »Miten kova lieneekään luonne, se sulaa rakkauden tulessa. Ellei se sula, niin tuli ei ole kyllin voimakas.» (maaliskuun 9 p:nä 1920). Satyâgrahan jäsenet allekirjoittavat joukolla sitoumuksen, jossa he kieltäytyvät tottelemasta Satyâgrahan komitean luettelemia huonoja lakeja ja lupaavat seurata uskollisesti totuuden ääntä ja pidättyä kaikesta väkivallasta elämään, henkilöön ja omaisuuteen nähden.
U||[49] Tämä hindustanilainen, joskin alkuaan moslemilainen sana merkitsee »työn seisausta».
U||[50] Delhi muuten erehtyi päivästä; se oli aloittanutHartalinsa jo maaliskuun 30 p:nä.
U||[51] Gandhi puolestaan siirsi liikkeensä toistaiseksi, huhtikuun 18 p:ään 1919, rauhoittaakseen kuohuntaa sen sijaan että olisi kiihoittanut sitä, kuten jokainen vallankumouksellinen olisi tehnyt.
U||[52] Etymologia: Swa: self, itse; Deši: maa. Kansallinen riippumattomuus. »Pois väkivalta» -aatteen salaisuuksiin vihityt käsittävät sanan ennenkaikkea ahtaassa mielessä Taloudellinen riippumattomuus. Mutta myöhemmin tulemme näkemään, minkä »Sosialisen evankeliumin» Gandhin oppilaat siitä loihtivat.
U||[53] Mitä Karl Marx nimittää nimellä »Voyoucratie» — katupoikavalta.
U||[54] Sellainen on ainakin Gandhin selitys. Uskaltaneeko eurooppalainen väittää näkevänsä Bhagavad Gîtâssa edes tyyntä välinpitämättömyyttä tehtyä ja kärsittyä väkivaltaa kohtaan?
U||[55] Huhtikuun 23 p:nä 1920, heinäkuun 8 p:nä ja syyskuun 1 p:nä 1921. Kirjoitelmassaan Kirje Parseille, jotka ovat suuria kauppamiehiä, Gandhi rukoilee heitä sulkemaan juomakauppansa. Kirjoitelmassaan Kirje kohtuullisille hän pyytää heitä, vaikkeivät olisikaan yhtä mieltä hänen kanssaan loppu-ohjelmasta, tukemaan hänen ponnistuksiaan tässä kohden. Samaan aikaan hän taistelee myös lääkkeiden kauppaa ja opiuminpolttotupia vastaan.
U||[56] Gandhi tietää itse, että hänelle tullaan nauramaan. Mutta, hän sanoo, onko neula jättänyt paikkansa ompelukoneelle tai käsi kirjoituskoneelle? Rukki ei ole mitään kadottanut tarpeellisuudestaan. Ja se on nykyään kansallinen välttämättömyys, ainut mahdollinen tulolähde miljoonille nälkiintyneille (24 p:nä heinäk. 1920).
U||[57] Englannin kieli ei ole syrjäytetty (enempää kuin mikään muukaan eurooppalainen kieli). Se jätetään ylimmille kursseille, oppiajan loppuun. Murteita sensijaan käytetään kaikilla yliopistonasteilla. Gandhi haaveilee yleisen olemassaolon korkeinta tilaa, missä kaikki erilaisuudet kestävät kokonaisuutena, ei eri osastoina, vaan »ikäänkuin saman jalokiven eri särminä.» (kesäkuussa 1920).
U||[58] Ei »ammatillinen», sillä on tarkoitus juuri erottaa sielu ammatista.
U||[59] Ašram: kurinalainen paikka, luostari.
U||[60] Nagpurin kongressiin otti osaa 4726 edustajaa, joista 469 moslemia, 65 sikhiä, 5 parsia, 2 »halveksittua», 4079 hindua, 106 naista.
U||Uusi perustuslaki määräsi, että oli nimitettävä yksi edusmies 50.000:ttä asukasta kohden: tämä tekisi kaikkiaan 6173 edustajaa. Koko Intian kansallinen Kongressi kokoontui istuntoon kerran vuodessa (joulun aikaan). Koko Intian Kongressin komitea, joka käsitti noin 350 jäsentä, sai tehtäväkseen Kongressin politiikan toimeenpanon, tulkitsemalla sen päätöksiä; sillä on Kongressin istuntojen väliajalla sama arvovalta kuin edellisellä. 15-jäsenisellä Toimeenpanevalla komitealla on Kabinetin suhde Parlamenttiin; sen voi Kongressin komitea lakkauttaa.
U||Nagpurin Kongressi teki suunnitelmat, että muodostettaisiin Maaseutukongressin komiteat, jotka edustaisivat maakuntaa ja 12 kieltä, ja niiden alaisia Paikallisia kongressikomiteoja kaikkia kyliä ja kyläryhmiä varten työläis- tai virkamiesarmeijoineen (Intian kansallinen sotapalvelus), joita ylläpitäisi koko Intian Swarâj-rahasto Tilakin muistoksi.
U||Jokainen täysikäinen mies tai nainen, jolla on neljä annaa, on valitsija sillä ehdolla, että on allekirjoittanut Perustuslain credon. Vaalikelpoisuusikä on 21 vuotta. Ehtona on se, että hyväksyy Perustuslain ensimmäisen pykälän, kongressin asetukset ja toimenpiteet.
U||[61] Pannen esimerkiksi läheisen ystävyytensä moslemi Maulana Mahomed Aliin hän todistaa kummankin pysyvän uskollisena uskonnolleen. Gandhi ei antaisi tytärtään naimisiin Alin pojille, hän ei jakaisi ruokaa ystävänsä kanssa; ja hänen ystävänsä tekisi samoin. Tämä ei estä heitä pitämästä toisistaan ja olemasta varmat toisistaan. Gandhi ei väitä ollenkaan, että hindujen ja moslemien väliset avioliitot ja yhteiset ateriat olisivat tuomittavat, mutta tarvittaisiin vuosisata tähän yhteensulamiseen pääsemiseen. Käytännöllisen politiikan ei pidä harrastaa sellaista uudistusta. Gandhi ei pane sille estettä, mutta hän pitää sitä ennenaikaisena. Tässä taas ilmenee hänen todellisuusvaistonsa.
U||[62] Huhtikuun lopusta v. 1921 halveksinta vähenee. Useissa kylissä paariat elävät toisten hindujen kanssa ja nauttivat heidän oikeuksiansa. Sitä vastoin toisissa paikoin, etenkin Madrasissa, heidän asemansa pysyi surkuteltavana. — Kysymys on vastaiseksi kirjoitettu intialaisten Kansallisten Kokousten päiväjärjestykseen. Nagpurin Kongressi oli jo joulukuussa 1920 luvannut hävittää »halveksintasynnin.»
U||[63] Erään hänen kirjoitelmansa otsakkeena on: Our fallen sisters (syyskuun 15 p:nä 1921).
U||[64] Gandhi panee vastalauseen Young Indiassa (kesäkuussa 1921).
U||[65] Lettres from Abroad. Kolme kirjettä maaliskuun 2:selta 5:nneltä ja 13:nnelta päivältä 1921 on julaistu Modern Review'ssa toukokuussa 1921. Tagoren Intiaan palattuaan kirjoittama Totuuden vaatimus ilmestyi Modern Review'ssa lokakuun 1 p:nä 1921.
U||Näiden kiistakirjoitusten lisäksi tiedämme Tagoren palattuaan henkilökohtaisesti tavanneen Gandhin. Kukaan ei ole julkaissut siitä kuvausta. Mutta C.-F. Andrews, sen todistaja, on hyväntahtoisesti ilmoittanut meille väittelyn aiheet ja vastakkaisuuden pääkohdat.
U||[66] Hän mainitsee juuri tästä eräässä viimeisimmistä kirjoitelmistaan, jota hän nimittää: »Liian pyhä tullakseen painetuksi» (helmikuun 9 p:nä 1922). Tagore ja Gandhi ovat tunteneet toisensa jo pitkän aikaa, Gandhi oli useasti oleskellut Tagoren luona Santiniketanissa. Hänellä oli lupa, sanoo hän, pitää tätä taloa turvapaikkanaan; ja hänen ollessaan Englannissa hänen lapsensa olivat siellä kasvatettavina.
U||[67] Ja myöhemmin: »Kaikki kunnia Mahatmalle! Mutta poliitikkomme eivät voi luopua halustaan saada käytellä häntä salaisen ja viekkaan šakkipelinsä siirtonappulana.»

U||[75] Uskonnollinen kohtalo.
U||[76] Siellä täällä muuten ihailtavia siveellisiä säädöksiä! »Mikä on mennyt, on mennyt. Mennyt on peruuttamaton, siitä on tullut osa iäisyyttä, eikä ihmisellä ole enää mitään vaatimusta siihen. Älä haudo kostoaikeita vääryyksille ja olleille loukkauksille! Kuollut menneisyys haudatkoon kuolleensa! Toimikaamme elävässä nykyajassa, ohjaajinamme sydämemme ja Jumala!» Kirjan alusta sen loppuun jäätikön puhtaus.
U||[77] Tagore oli kai sitäkin herkempi tällaisille kirjoituksille, kun Gandhin Ašramin (mistä tämä Evankeliumi on kotoisin) ja Tagoren Santiniketanin välillä oli syntynyt kilpailu, jota molemmat johtajat koettivat välttää. Sen näkee eräästä kirjoitelmasta helmikuun 9 p:ltä 1922 Young Indiassa: Gandhi valittaa siinä, että joku sanomalehtimies oli Ašramin asiassa hänen omikseen pannut sanoja, joilla oli Santiniketania loukkaaava luonne. Hän todistaa kunnioitustaan Tagoren taloa kohtaan — kylläkin vissillä peitetyllä huumorilla: »Jos minun tulisi päättää toisen tai toisen paremmuudesta», hän sanoo, »huolimatta Ašramin kurista ja aamunoususta, minä äänestän Santiniketania. Se on vanhempi veli, paljon vanhempi iältään ja myös viisaudeltaan. »Mutta hän lisää ilkeästi: »Varokaa, Santiniketanin asukkaat, kilpailua pienen Ašramin kanssa!»
U||[78] Minun mielestäni Gandhi on yhtä yleismaailmallinen kuin Tagore, mutta toisella tavoin. Hän on sitä siveelliseltä tunnoltaan, Tagore järjeltään. Gandhi ei sulje ketään pois rukouksen ja jokapäiväisen työn yhteydestä. Täten ei apostoli ensimmäisistä ajoista saakka erottanut juutalaisia pakanoista; mutta kaikille hän määräsi saman siveellisen kasvatuksen. Näin tahtoo Gandhi. Mutta juuri tässä on hänen ahdasmielisyytensä: ei sydämessä, joka on yhtä laaja kuin Kristuksen, vaan älyllisen asketismin ja köyhyyden hengessä. (Tämä on niinikään Kristusta.) Gandhi on keskiaikainen universalisti. Vaikka häntä kunnioitammekin, olemme Tagoren puolella.
U||[79] 140 kylää; 87000 asukasta.
U||[80] Samana päivänä eräs julistus Young Indiassa ilmoittaa Intialle samaisen ultimatumin vielä suuremmalla voimalla. Jollei varakuningas mitään vastaa, on käsky epäämätön; siviilitottelemattomuus on saatava täytäntöön kaikin mokomin, vaikkakin nykyään enemmistö panisi vastaan.
U||[81] Poliisin rakennukset.
U||[82] Pantakoon merkille tämä valo, joka valaisee tämän sielun salaperäistä voimaa, sielun, jossa hänen kansansa värähtelyt heijastuvat!
U||[83] Gandhille oli tullut selväksi, että osa hänen enemmistöään, joka kannatti »pois väkivalta» -aatetta, näki siinä vain piilevän poliittisen keinon, joka oli naamiona väkivallan valmistelulle. Gandhi sanoo heidän puhuvan imelästi väkivallattomien iskujen antamisesta. Gandhi oli käsittänyt vaarallisen kaksimielisyyden, minkä Tagore oli jo kauan sitten havainnut. Ja se häntä tukahdutti. Ankarammin kuin Tagore hän nyt sen ilmiantaa ja lausuu vasten silmiä.
U||[84] The great Trial, 23 p:nä maalisk. 1922, Young india.
U||[85] »Jos keisarikuntamme olemassaolo on asetettu vaaraan, jos estetään brittiläistä hallitusta täyttämästä vastuunalaisuuksiaan Intiaa kohtaan, jos kuvitellaan meidän aikovan vetäytyä pois Intiasta, niin Intia turhaan uhmaa maailman kaikkein päättävintä kansaa, joka kyllä vastaa kaikella tarpeellisella tarmolla.»
U||[86] Syyskuun 19 p:ltä ja joulukuun 15 p:ltä 1921. Ensimmäinen Ali-veljeksiä vastaan suunnatun syytöksen johdosta, toinen vastaukseksi lordi Readingin kiihoittavaan puheeseen. Niissä löytää saman julistuksen sodan loppuun saakka.» — »Tahdomme kukistaa hallituksen, pakottaa, sen alistumaan kansan tahtoon. Me emme pyydä armahdusta, me emme sitä odota…»
U||[87] Suuri Banker, joka jutun aikana oli seurannut uskonnollisesti Mahatman esimerkkiä, yhtyen kaikkiin hänen puheisiinsa, tuomittiin vuoden vankeuteen ynnä sakkoihin.
U||[88] Rouva Kasturibai Gandhi ilmoitti tuomion Intian miehille ja naisille hyvin arvokkaassa tiedonannossa, joka kehoittaa kansaa rauhassa keskittäytymään Gandhin rakentavaan ohjelmaan.
U||Gandhia ei jätetty Sabamratin vankilaan, missä häntä kohdeltiin hyvin. Hänet siirrettiin salaiseen paikkaan, sitten Yeravdaan, lähelle Poonaa. Eräs N.S. Hardikerin kertomus: Gandhi vankilassa (Unity, toukokuun 18 p:nä 1922), vakuuttaa, että hänet pantiin tavallisen rikollisen ravintojärjestelmään ilman mitään erikoisoikeuksia ja että hänen heikko terveytensä siitä kärsi. Mutta me tiedämme, että kohtelu on nyt taasen tullut inhimillisemmäksi. Gandhin on sallittu lukea ja kirjoittaa.
U||Sen mukaan mitä C.-F. Andrews on minulle sanonut, on Mahatma onnellinen vankilassa, hän on pyytänyt, etteivät toverit tulisi häntä katsomaan, vaan kunnioittaisivat hänen yksinäisyyttään; hän puhdistautuu, hän rukoilee ja on vakuutettu, että hänen toimintansa täten on tehokkain Intian asialle. — C.-F. Andrews vakuuttaa, että gandhilaisten puolue on todellakin paljon voittanut tästä vangitsemisesta. Intia uskoo Gandhiin innokkaammin kuin koskaan; se näkee itsepäisesti hänessä šri Krišnan lihaksitulon, joka tarun mukaan voitollisesti kestää vankilan koetukset. Ja Gandhi on, vangittuna varmemmin kuin vapaana, estänyt väkivallan purkauksen, jonka vaaran läheisyyden hän tunsi.
U||[89] Aikakauskirja Unity on julaissut (elokuun 3 p:nä 1922) erään uudenaikaista sivistystä vastustavan Kirjeen vankilasta, mikä kirje minusta näyttää hämäräperäiseltä. Olen siinä huomaavinani vanhojen sivujen jäljennöksiä, osia Hind Swarâjista.
U||[90] Guru-Ka-Bagh on pyhättö (Gurdwara), kymmenen penikulmaa Amritsarista.
U||[91] The Akali Struggle, ilmestynyt Madrasin Swarâjyassa ja julkaistu erikseen syyskuun 12 p:nä 1922.
U||[92] Mitä tulee väkivaltaisiin vallankumouksellisiin aineksiin, oli niitä vähän Gayassa, ja ne näyttelivät siellä vain toisen asteen osaa.
U||[93] Eräs Blanche Watsonin artikkeli (Unity, marraskuun 16 p:ltä 1922) luettelee »ne edut, mitkä Intia on saavuttanut väkivallattoman vastarinnan taistelusta.» Hän vakuuttaa, että Intian sisäiset tulot ovat vähenneet 75 miljoonalla dollarilla ja että englantilaisten kankaiden hylkiminen on tuottanut Englannille vuodessa 20 miljoonan dollarin menetyksen. Hän arvioi 30.000:ksi niiden intialaisten lukumäärän, jotka tänä kuukauden päivänä olivat vangitut, ja osoittaa hallituksen johtavan koneiston täydellisesti kelvottomaksi. Mutta Blanche Watsonilla, gandhilaisuuden innokkaalla ihailijalla, on itsetiedoton pyrkimys liioitella sen menestystä. On muita todistuksia, jotka näyttävät vähemmän lupaavilta Ne sanovat, että uhrautumisliike kompastuu kauppias- ja varakkaiden luokkien itsekkyyteen ja että monta ensi innossa tehtyä eronpyyntöä on sittemmin peruutettu. Ei olisikaan inhimillistä otaksua vastakkaista. Kaikessa vallankumouksessa jää moni kehityksestä jäljelle tai palaa jär
U||kiinsä. On tärkeätä tietää, pysyykö virta syvissä uomissaan. Kas tässä todistus, jonka tärkeyttä ja puolueettomuutta on mahdoton epäillä: Manchester Guardian, jonka älykkään vapaamielisyyden tunnemme, mutta joka edustaa voimakkaita etuja, jotka gandhilainen »pois yhteistoiminta» on suorastaan vienyt perikatoon, on juuri ryhtynyt tarkkaavaiseen lailliseen tutkimukseen kautta Intian. Tämä tutkimus on julkaistu kirjoitelmasarjassa. Huolimatta siinä ilmenevästä (aivan luonnollisesta) sympatian puutteesta intialaisen liikkeen suhteen ja huolimatta, että se koettaa sitä halventaa, toteaa lukija rivi riviltä kasvavalla huolestumisella tilanteen vakavuuden Englantiin nähden. Minä esitän lyhykäisesti loppukirjoitelman, joka ilmestyi helmikuun 16 p:nä 1923 (Manchester Guardian Weekly). Tutkija tahtoo luulotella itselleen, että gandhilaisten taktiikka on kärsinyt kovan tappion ja että »pois yhteistoiminta»-liikkeen on uudelleen järjestäydyttävä toisin suunnitelmin. »Mutta», h
U||n lisää, »pois yhteistoiminta» -henki pysyy. Joka puolella on, jollei gandhilaisuutta, niin ainakin vieraan hallituksen epäilyä ja palavaa halua päästä siitä irti. Sivistyneet luokat ja kaupunkilaiset ovat tämän hengen läpitunkemat. Ryotia (talonpoikaa) tämä liikuttaa vasta jokseenkin pintapuolisesti; mutta olosuhteet kylissä ovat sellaiset, että hänetkin lopulta voitetaan. Armeija näyttää vielä puolueettomalta; mutta se on majoitettu kyliin; ja ennemmin tai myöhemmin se tulee seuraamaan liikettä. Usein parhaimmilla, jopa pidättyneimmillä tämä »pois yhteistoiminta» -henki on voimakkain. Ainoastaan hillityillä on vastenmielisyys vallankumoustapoihin; mutta tätä vastenmielisyyttä ei tunne maa. Se tuntee myötätuntoa »pois yhteistoiminta» -miesten uhkarohkeutta enemmän kuin hillittyjen varovaisuutta kohtaan.» Englantilainen huomioitsija arvioi kymmeneksi vuodeksi ajan, mikä tarvitaan sellaiseen intialaisten talonpoikain järjestäytymiseen, että kieltäydyttäisiin vero
U||a maksamasta ja käytäisiin vallankumoukseen. Mutta sillä aikaa tilanne lakkaamatta pahenee; on mahdotonta enää pitää intialaisia aisoissa vankilan pelolla: tätä pelkoa ei heillä enää ole olemassa; siihen tultaisiin ankarammilla pakkotoimenpiteillä, mutta nämä vain lisäisivät vihaa. »Ainoa rauhallinen ja mahdollinen selvitys, jos sellainen on olemassa, on seuraava: »Englannin on tehtävä aloite intialaisiin uudistuksiin. Ei enää puoliparannuksia, niinkuin tapahtui v. 1919, jolloin sellaisia koetettiin sovittaa käytäntöön vajaan vuoden ajan. Ne eivät enää riitä, ja aika kiiruhtaa. Kootkoon Englanti intialaisen kansallisen konventsionin, jossa olisivat edustettuina Intian edut ja kaikki ajatusvivahdukset: yhtä hyvin Gandhi oppilainensa kuin intialaiset prinssit ja eurooppalaiset kapitalistit, moslemit, hindut, parsit, eurasinit, kristityt, halveksitut… valmistakoon tämä konventsioni valtakuntaan kuuluvalle autonomiselle Intialle perustuslain ja määrätköön tämän Home Rul
U||en toimeenpanon määräasemat! Täten ja ainoastaan täten voi torjua valtakunnan hajautumisen.
U||En tiedä, missä määrin Intian hallitus ja englantilainen byrokratia hyväksyvät tällaisen suunnitelman, jota Manchester Guardian kirjeenvaihtajansa mukaan puoltaa tarmolla. Minun on vähän vaikeata uskoa, että Gandhi ja »pois yhteistoiminta» -miehet suostuisivat yhtymään samaan intialaiseen kokoukseen eurooppalaisten ja intialaisten kapitalistien kanssa! Mutta varmalta näyttää vain, ettei Intian Home Rule ole enää kysymyksenalainen. Muodossa tai toisessa se on välttämätön. Eikä mikään ole hämmästyttävämpää kuin Englannin äänensävyn muuttuminen Intian suhteen Gandhin toiminnan alusta laskien. Eurooppalaiset eivät enää halveksi intialaisia, yritetään puhua heistä kunnioituksella, ja suostutaan välttämään kömpelöitä väkivaltaisuuksia, joihin tätä ennen pahimmassa pakossa turvauduttiin, joskus ensi keinonakin. Intia on siveellisesti voittanut.

U||Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
U||Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.
U||Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
U||Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
U||The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541.

U||Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
U||Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
U||The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
U||While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
U||International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
U||Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
U||Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
U||Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
U||Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
U||Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org.
U||This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
