U||LES MIS√âRABLES
U||PREFACE
U||So long as there shall exist, by virtue of law and custom, decrees of damnation pronounced by society, artificially creating hells amid the civilization of earth, and adding the element of human fate to divine destiny; so long as the three great problems of the century‚Äîthe degradation of man through pauperism, the corruption of woman through hunger, the crippling of children through lack of light‚Äîare unsolved; so long as social asphyxia is possible in any part of the world;‚Äîin other words, and with a still wider significance, so long as ignorance and poverty exist on earth, books of the nature of Les Mis√©rables cannot fail to be of use.

U||BOOK FIRST‚ÄîA JUST MAN
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîM. MYRIEL
U||In 1815, M. Charles-Fran√ßois-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî He was an old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied the see of D‚Äî‚Äî since 1806.
U||Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese. True or false, that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all in their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar. It was said that his father, destining him to be the heir of his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen or twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it was said that Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk. He was well formed, though rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the whole of the first portion of his 
U||life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.
U||The Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation; the parliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were dispersed. M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning of the Revolution. There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from which she had long suffered. He had no children. What took place next in the fate of M. Myriel? The ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fall of his own family, the tragic spectacles of ‚Äô93, which were, perhaps, even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance, with the magnifying powers of terror,‚Äîdid these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him? Was he, in the midst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life, suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastrophes would not shake, by striking at his existence and his fortune? No one could have told: all that was k
U||nown was, that when he returned from Italy he was a priest.
U||In 1804, M. Myriel was the Cur√© of B‚Äî‚Äî [Brignolles]. He was already advanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.
U||About the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with his curacy‚Äîjust what, is not precisely known‚Äîtook him to Paris. Among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners was M. le Cardinal Fesch. One day, when the Emperor had come to visit his uncle, the worthy Cur√©, who was waiting in the anteroom, found himself present when His Majesty passed. Napoleon, on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man, turned round and said abruptly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWho is this good man who is staring at me?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSire,‚Äù said M. Myriel, ‚Äúyou are looking at a good man, and I at a great man. Each of us can profit by it.‚Äù
U||That very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Cur√©, and some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî
U||What truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of M. Myriel‚Äôs life? No one knew. Very few families had been acquainted with the Myriel family before the Revolution.
U||M. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town, where there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think. He was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and because he was a bishop. But after all, the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only,‚Äînoise, sayings, words; less than words‚Äîpalabres, as the energetic language of the South expresses it.
U||However that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in D‚Äî‚Äî, all the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion. No one would have dared to mention them; no one would have dared to recall them.
U||M. Myriel had arrived at D‚Äî‚Äî accompanied by an elderly spinster, Mademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his junior.
U||Their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as Mademoiselle Baptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having been the servant of M. le Cur√©, now assumed the double title of maid to Mademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.
U||Mademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; she realized the ideal expressed by the word ‚Äúrespectable‚Äù; for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. She had never been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen. She was a soul rather than a virgin. Her person seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever drooping;‚Äîa mere pretext for a soul‚Äôs remaining on the earth.
U||Madame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and bustling; always out of breath,‚Äîin the first place, because of her activity, and in the next, because of her asthma.
U||On his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop immediately after a major-general. The mayor and the president paid the first call on him, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the general and the prefect.
U||The installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîM. MYRIEL BECOMES M. WELCOME
U||The episcopal palace of D‚Äî‚Äî adjoins the hospital.
U||The episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone at the beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology of the Faculty of Paris, Abb√© of Simore, who had been Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî in 1712. This palace was a genuine seignorial residence. Everything about it had a grand air,‚Äîthe apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms, the chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks encircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens planted with magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superb gallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened on the gardens, M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, My Lords Charles Br√ªlart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d‚ÄôEmbrun; Antoine de Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vend√¥me, Grand Prior of France, Abb√© of Saint Honor√© de L√©rins; Fran√ßois de Berton de Crillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; C√©sar de Sabran de Forcalquier, bishop, Seignor of Gland√
U||®ve; and Jean Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, preacher in ordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of Senez. The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment; and this memorable date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble.
U||The hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with a small garden.
U||Three days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. The visit ended, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur the director of the hospital,‚Äù said he to him, ‚Äúhow many sick people have you at the present moment?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTwenty-six, Monseigneur.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat was the number which I counted,‚Äù said the Bishop.
U||‚ÄúThe beds,‚Äù pursued the director, ‚Äúare very much crowded against each other.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is what I observed.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe halls are nothing but rooms, and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSo it seems to me.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd then, when there is a ray of sun, the garden is very small for the convalescents.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat was what I said to myself.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn case of epidemics,‚Äîwe have had the typhus fever this year; we had the sweating sickness two years ago, and a hundred patients at times,‚Äîwe know not what to do.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is the thought which occurred to me.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat would you have, Monseigneur?‚Äù said the director. ‚ÄúOne must resign one‚Äôs self.‚Äù
U||This conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on the ground floor.
U||The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúhow many beds do you think this hall alone would hold?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMonseigneur‚Äôs dining-room?‚Äù exclaimed the stupefied director.
U||The Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes.
U||‚ÄúIt would hold full twenty beds,‚Äù said he, as though speaking to himself. Then, raising his voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHold, Monsieur the director of the hospital, I will tell you something. There is evidently a mistake here. There are thirty-six of you, in five or six small rooms. There are three of us here, and we have room for sixty. There is some mistake, I tell you; you have my house, and I have yours. Give me back my house; you are at home here.‚Äù
U||On the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in the Bishop‚Äôs palace, and the Bishop was settled in the hospital.
U||M. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by the Revolution. His sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs, which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage. M. Myriel received from the State, in his quality of bishop, a salary of fifteen thousand francs. On the very day when he took up his abode in the hospital, M. Myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all, in the following manner. We transcribe here a note made by his own hand:‚Äî
U||NOTE ON THE REGULATION OF MY HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.
U||For the little seminary	1,500 livres
U||Society of the mission	100    ‚Äù
U||For the Lazarists of Montdidier	100    ‚Äù
U||Seminary for foreign missions in Paris	200    ‚Äù
U||Congregation of the Holy Spirit	150    ‚Äù
U||Religious establishments of the Holy Land	100    ‚Äù
U||Charitable maternity societies	300    ‚Äù
U||Extra, for that of Arles	50    ‚Äù
U||Work for the amelioration of prisons	400    ‚Äù
U||Work for the relief and delivery of prisoners	500    ‚Äù
U||To liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt	1,000    ‚Äù
U||Addition to the salary of the poor teachers of the diocese	2,000    ‚Äù
U||Public granary of the Hautes-Alpes	100    ‚Äù
U||Congregation of the ladies of D‚Äî‚Äî, of Manosque, and of Sisteron,
U||for the gratuitous instruction of poor girls	1,500    ‚Äù
U||For the poor	6,000    ‚Äù
U||My personal expenses	1,000    ‚Äù
U||	‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
U||Total	15,000    ‚Äù
U||M. Myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied the see of D‚Äî‚Äî As has been seen, he called it regulating his household expenses.
U||This arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by Mademoiselle Baptistine. This holy woman regarded Monseigneur of D‚Äî‚Äî as at one and the same time her brother and her bishop, her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the Church. She simply loved and venerated him. When he spoke, she bowed; when he acted, she yielded her adherence. Their only servant, Madame Magloire, grumbled a little. It will be observed that Monsieur the Bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres, which, added to the pension of Mademoiselle Baptistine, made fifteen hundred francs a year. On these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted.
U||And when a village curate came to D‚Äî‚Äî, the Bishop still found means to entertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, and to the intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine.
U||One day, after he had been in D‚Äî‚Äî about three months, the Bishop said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd still I am quite cramped with it all!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI should think so!‚Äù exclaimed Madame Magloire. ‚ÄúMonseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town, and for his journeys about the diocese. It was customary for bishops in former days.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHold!‚Äù cried the Bishop, ‚Äúyou are quite right, Madame Magloire.‚Äù
U||And he made his demand.
U||Some time afterwards the General Council took this demand under consideration, and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs, under this heading: Allowance to M. the Bishop for expenses of carriage, expenses of posting, and expenses of pastoral visits.
U||This provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senator of the Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundred which favored the 18 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of D‚Äî‚Äî, wrote to M. Bigot de Pr√©ameneu, the minister of public worship, a very angry and confidential note on the subject, from which we extract these authentic lines:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúExpenses of carriage? What can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants? Expenses of journeys? What is the use of these trips, in the first place? Next, how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts? There are no roads. No one travels otherwise than on horseback. Even the bridge between Durance and Ch√¢teau-Arnoux can barely support ox-teams. These priests are all thus, greedy and avaricious. This man played the good priest when he first came. Now he does like the rest; he must have a carriage and a posting-chaise, he must have luxuries, like the bishops of the olden days. Oh, all this priesthood! Things will not go well, M. le Comte, until the Emperor has freed us from these black-capped rascals. Down with the Pope! [Matters were getting embroiled with Rome.] For my part, I am for C√¶sar alone.‚Äù Etc., etc.
U||On the other hand, this affair afforded great delight to Madame Magloire. ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù said she to Mademoiselle Baptistine; ‚ÄúMonseigneur began with other people, but he has had to wind up with himself, after all. He has regulated all his charities. Now here are three thousand francs for us! At last!‚Äù
U||That same evening the Bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a memorandum conceived in the following terms:‚Äî
U||EXPENSES OF CARRIAGE AND CIRCUIT.
U||For furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital	1,500 livres
U||For the maternity charitable society of Aix	250    ‚Äù
U||For the maternity charitable society of Draguignan	250    ‚Äù
U||For foundlings	500    ‚Äù
U||For orphans	500    ‚Äù
U||	‚Äî‚Äî
U||Total	3,000    ‚Äù
U||Such was M. Myriel‚Äôs budget.
U||As for the chance episcopal perquisites, the fees for marriage bans, dispensations, private baptisms, sermons, benedictions, of churches or chapels, marriages, etc., the Bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity, since he bestowed them on the needy.
U||After a time, offerings of money flowed in. Those who had and those who lacked knocked at M. Myriel‚Äôs door,‚Äîthe latter in search of the alms which the former came to deposit. In less than a year the Bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress. Considerable sums of money passed through his hands, but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life, or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities.
U||Far from it. As there is always more wretchedness below than there is brotherhood above, all was given away, so to speak, before it was received. It was like water on dry soil; no matter how much money he received, he never had any. Then he stripped himself.
U||The usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the head of their charges and their pastoral letters, the poor people of the country-side had selected, with a sort of affectionate instinct, among the names and prenomens of their bishop, that which had a meaning for them; and they never called him anything except Monseigneur Bienvenu [Welcome]. We will follow their example, and will also call him thus when we have occasion to name him. Moreover, this appellation pleased him.
U||‚ÄúI like that name,‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúBienvenu makes up for the Monseigneur.‚Äù
U||We do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable; we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîA HARD BISHOPRIC FOR A GOOD BISHOP
U||The Bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms. The diocese of D‚Äî‚Äî is a fatiguing one. There are very few plains and a great many mountains; hardly any roads, as we have just seen; thirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, and two hundred and eighty-five auxiliary chapels. To visit all these is quite a task.
U||The Bishop managed to do it. He went on foot when it was in the neighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, and on a donkey in the mountains. The two old women accompanied him. When the trip was too hard for them, he went alone.
U||One day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal city. He was mounted on an ass. His purse, which was very dry at that moment, did not permit him any other equipage. The mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town, and watched him dismount from his ass, with scandalized eyes. Some of the citizens were laughing around him. ‚ÄúMonsieur the Mayor,‚Äù said the Bishop, ‚Äúand Messieurs Citizens, I perceive that I shock you. You think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by Jesus Christ. I have done so from necessity, I assure you, and not from vanity.‚Äù
U||In the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent, and talked rather than preached. He never went far in search of his arguments and his examples. He quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of a neighboring district. In the cantons where they were harsh to the poor, he said: ‚ÄúLook at the people of Brian√ßon! They have conferred on the poor, on widows and orphans, the right to have their meadows mown three days in advance of every one else. They rebuild their houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined. Therefore it is a country which is blessed by God. For a whole century, there has not been a single murderer among them.‚Äù
U||In villages which were greedy for profit and harvest, he said: ‚ÄúLook at the people of Embrun! If, at the harvest season, the father of a family has his son away on service in the army, and his daughters at service in the town, and if he is ill and incapacitated, the cur√© recommends him to the prayers of the congregation; and on Sunday, after the mass, all the inhabitants of the village‚Äîmen, women, and children‚Äîgo to the poor man‚Äôs field and do his harvesting for him, and carry his straw and his grain to his granary.‚Äù To families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said: ‚ÄúLook at the mountaineers of Devolny, a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years. Well, when the father of a family dies, the boys go off to seek their fortunes, leaving the property to the girls, so that they may find husbands.‚Äù To the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits, and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper, he said: ‚ÄúLook at those good peasants in the v
U||alley of Queyras! There are three thousand souls of them. Mon Dieu! it is like a little republic. Neither judge nor bailiff is known there. The mayor does everything. He allots the imposts, taxes each person conscientiously, judges quarrels for nothing, divides inheritances without charge, pronounces sentences gratuitously; and he is obeyed, because he is a just man among simple men.‚Äù To villages where he found no schoolmaster, he quoted once more the people of Queyras: ‚ÄúDo you know how they manage?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSince a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a teacher, they have schoolmasters who are paid by the whole valley, who make the round of the villages, spending a week in this one, ten days in that, and instruct them. These teachers go to the fairs. I have seen them there. They are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cord of their hat. Those who teach reading only have one pen; those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens; those who teach
U|| reading, reckoning, and Latin have three pens. But what a disgrace to be ignorant! Do like the people of Queyras!‚Äù
U||Thus he discoursed gravely and paternally; in default of examples, he invented parables, going directly to the point, with few phrases and many images, which characteristic formed the real eloquence of Jesus Christ. And being convinced himself, he was persuasive.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîWORKS CORRESPONDING TO WORDS
U||His conversation was gay and affable. He put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him. When he laughed, it was the laugh of a schoolboy. Madame Magloire liked to call him Your Grace [Votre Grandeur]. One day he rose from his armchair, and went to his library in search of a book. This book was on one of the upper shelves. As the bishop was rather short of stature, he could not reach it. ‚ÄúMadame Magloire,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúfetch me a chair. My greatness [grandeur] does not reach as far as that shelf.‚Äù
U||One of his distant relatives, Madame la Comtesse de L√¥, rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating, in his presence, what she designated as ‚Äúthe expectations‚Äù of her three sons. She had numerous relatives, who were very old and near to death, and of whom her sons were the natural heirs. The youngest of the three was to receive from a grandaunt a good hundred thousand livres of income; the second was the heir by entail to the title of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather. The Bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts. On one occasion, however, he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual, while Madame de L√¥ was relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these ‚Äúexpectations.‚Äù She interrupted herself impatiently: ‚ÄúMon Dieu, cousin! What are you thinking about?‚Äù ‚ÄúI am thinking,‚Äù replied the Bishop, ‚Äúof a singular remark, which is to be found, I believe, in St. Augus
U||tine,‚Äî‚ÄòPlace your hopes in the man from whom you do not inherit.‚Äô‚Äù
U||At another time, on receiving a notification of the decease of a gentleman of the country-side, wherein not only the dignities of the dead man, but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives, spread over an entire page: ‚ÄúWhat a stout back Death has!‚Äù he exclaimed. ‚ÄúWhat a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him, and how much wit must men have, in order thus to press the tomb into the service of vanity!‚Äù
U||He was gifted, on occasion, with a gentle raillery, which almost always concealed a serious meaning. In the course of one Lent, a youthful vicar came to D‚Äî‚Äî, and preached in the cathedral. He was tolerably eloquent. The subject of his sermon was charity. He urged the rich to give to the poor, in order to avoid hell, which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable, and to win paradise, which he represented as charming and desirable. Among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant, who was somewhat of a usurer, named M. G√©borand, who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth, serges, and woollen galloons. Never in his whole life had M. G√©borand bestowed alms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of that sermon, it was observed that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old beggar-women at the door of the cathedral. There were six of them to share it. One day the Bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity, and said to his sister, with
U|| a smile, ‚ÄúThere is M. G√©borand purchasing paradise for a sou.‚Äù
U||When it was a question of charity, he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal, and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection. Once he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room of the town; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier, a wealthy and avaricious old man, who contrived to be, at one and the same time, an ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairian. This variety of man has actually existed. When the Bishop came to him, he touched his arm, ‚ÄúYou must give me something, M. le Marquis.‚Äù The Marquis turned round and answered dryly, ‚ÄúI have poor people of my own, Monseigneur.‚Äù ‚ÄúGive them to me,‚Äù replied the Bishop.
U||One day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMy very dear brethren, my good friends, there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants‚Äô dwellings in France which have but three openings; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings, the door and one window; and three hundred and forty-six thousand cabins besides which have but one opening, the door. And this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows. Just put poor families, old women and little children, in those buildings, and behold the fevers and maladies which result! Alas! God gives air to men; the law sells it to them. I do not blame the law, but I bless God. In the department of the Is√®re, in the Var, in the two departments of the Alpes, the Hautes, and the Basses, the peasants have not even wheelbarrows; they transport their manure on the backs of men; they have no candles, and they burn resinous sticks, and bits of rope dipped in pitch. That is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of Dauphin√©. They make
U|| bread for six months at one time; they bake it with dried cow-dung. In the winter they break this bread up with an axe, and they soak it for twenty-four hours, in order to render it eatable. My brethren, have pity! behold the suffering on all sides of you!‚Äù
U||Born a Proven√ßal, he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south. He said, ‚ÄúEn b√©! moussu, s√©s sag√©?‚Äù as in lower Languedoc; ‚ÄúOnt√© anaras passa?‚Äù as in the Basses-Alpes; ‚ÄúPuerte un bouen moutu embe un bouen fromage grase,‚Äù as in upper Dauphin√©. This pleased the people extremely, and contributed not a little to win him access to all spirits. He was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains. He understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms. As he spoke all tongues, he entered into all hearts.
U||Moreover, he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes. He condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account. He said, ‚ÄúExamine the road over which the fault has passed.‚Äù
U||Being, as he described himself with a smile, an ex-sinner, he had none of the asperities of austerity, and he professed, with a good deal of distinctness, and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous, a doctrine which may be summed up as follows:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMan has upon him his flesh, which is at once his burden and his temptation. He drags it with him and yields to it. He must watch it, check it, repress it, and obey it only at the last extremity. There may be some fault even in this obedience; but the fault thus committed is venial; it is a fall, but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer.
U||‚ÄúTo be a saint is the exception; to be an upright man is the rule. Err, fall, sin if you will, but be upright.
U||‚ÄúThe least possible sin is the law of man. No sin at all is the dream of the angel. All which is terrestrial is subject to sin. Sin is a gravitation.‚Äù
U||When he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly, and growing angry very quickly, ‚ÄúOh! oh!‚Äù he said, with a smile; ‚Äúto all appearance, this is a great crime which all the world commits. These are hypocrisies which have taken fright, and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter.‚Äù
U||He was indulgent towards women and poor people, on whom the burden of human society rest. He said, ‚ÄúThe faults of women, of children, of the feeble, the indigent, and the ignorant, are the fault of the husbands, the fathers, the masters, the strong, the rich, and the wise.‚Äù
U||He said, moreover, ‚ÄúTeach those who are ignorant as many things as possible; society is culpable, in that it does not afford instruction gratis; it is responsible for the night which it produces. This soul is full of shadow; sin is therein committed. The guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin, but the person who has created the shadow.‚Äù
U||It will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things: I suspect that he obtained it from the Gospel.
U||One day he heard a criminal case, which was in preparation and on the point of trial, discussed in a drawing-room. A wretched man, being at the end of his resources, had coined counterfeit money, out of love for a woman, and for the child which he had had by her. Counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch. The woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man. She was held, but there were no proofs except against her. She alone could accuse her lover, and destroy him by her confession. She denied; they insisted. She persisted in her denial. Thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown. He invented an infidelity on the part of the lover, and succeeded, by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented, in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival, and that the man was deceiving her. Thereupon, exasperated by jealousy, she denounced her lover, confessed all, proved all.
U||The man was ruined. He was shortly to be tried at Aix with his accomplice. They were relating the matter, and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate. By bringing jealousy into play, he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath, he had educed the justice of revenge. The Bishop listened to all this in silence. When they had finished, he inquired,‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhere are this man and woman to be tried?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAt the Court of Assizes.‚Äù
U||He went on, ‚ÄúAnd where will the advocate of the crown be tried?‚Äù
U||A tragic event occurred at D‚Äî‚Äî A man was condemned to death for murder. He was a wretched fellow, not exactly educated, not exactly ignorant, who had been a mountebank at fairs, and a writer for the public. The town took a great interest in the trial. On the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man, the chaplain of the prison fell ill. A priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments. They sent for the cur√©. It seems that he refused to come, saying, ‚ÄúThat is no affair of mine. I have nothing to do with that unpleasant task, and with that mountebank: I, too, am ill; and besides, it is not my place.‚Äù This reply was reported to the Bishop, who said, ‚ÄúMonsieur le Cur√© is right: it is not his place; it is mine.‚Äù
U||He went instantly to the prison, descended to the cell of the ‚Äúmountebank,‚Äù called him by name, took him by the hand, and spoke to him. He passed the entire day with him, forgetful of food and sleep, praying to God for the soul of the condemned man, and praying the condemned man for his own. He told him the best truths, which are also the most simple. He was father, brother, friend; he was bishop only to bless. He taught him everything, encouraged and consoled him. The man was on the point of dying in despair. Death was an abyss to him. As he stood trembling on its mournful brink, he recoiled with horror. He was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent. His condemnation, which had been a profound shock, had, in a manner, broken through, here and there, that wall which separates us from the mystery of things, and which we call life. He gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches, and beheld only darkness. The Bishop made him see light.
U||On the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, the Bishop was still there. He followed him, and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords.
U||He mounted the tumbril with him, he mounted the scaffold with him. The sufferer, who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day, was radiant. He felt that his soul was reconciled, and he hoped in God. The Bishop embraced him, and at the moment when the knife was about to fall, he said to him: ‚ÄúGod raises from the dead him whom man slays; he whom his brothers have rejected finds his Father once more. Pray, believe, enter into life: the Father is there.‚Äù When he descended from the scaffold, there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass. They did not know which was most worthy of admiration, his pallor or his serenity. On his return to the humble dwelling, which he designated, with a smile, as his palace, he said to his sister, ‚ÄúI have just officiated pontifically.‚Äù
U||Since the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood, there were people in the town who said, when commenting on this conduct of the Bishop, ‚ÄúIt is affectation.‚Äù
U||This, however, was a remark which was confined to the drawing-rooms. The populace, which perceives no jest in holy deeds, was touched, and admired him.
U||As for the Bishop, it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine, and it was a long time before he recovered from it.
U||In fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected and prepared, it has something about it which produces hallucination. One may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing upon it, from saying yes or no, so long as one has not seen a guillotine with one‚Äôs own eyes: but if one encounters one of them, the shock is violent; one is forced to decide, and to take part for or against. Some admire it, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like Beccaria. The guillotine is the concretion of the law; it is called vindicate; it is not neutral, and it does not permit you to remain neutral. He who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers. All social problems erect their interrogation point around this chopping-knife. The scaffold is a vision. The scaffold is not a piece of carpentry; the scaffold is not a machine; the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood, iron and cords.
U||It seems as though it were a being, possessed of I know not what sombre initiative; one would say that this piece of carpenter‚Äôs work saw, that this machine heard, that this mechanism understood, that this wood, this iron, and these cords were possessed of will. In the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise, and as though taking part in what is going on. The scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner; it devours, it eats flesh, it drinks blood; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter, a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted.
U||Therefore, the impression was terrible and profound; on the day following the execution, and on many succeeding days, the Bishop appeared to be crushed. The almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice tormented him. He, who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction, seemed to be reproaching himself. At times he talked to himself, and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice. This is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved: ‚ÄúI did not think that it was so monstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law. Death belongs to God alone. By what right do men touch that unknown thing?‚Äù
U||In course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished. Nevertheless, it was observed that the Bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution.
U||M. Myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying. He did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and his greatest labor. Widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him; he came of his own accord. He understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love, of the mother who had lost her child. As he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech. Oh, admirable consoler! He sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness, but to magnify and dignify it by hope. He said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHave a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead. Think not of that which perishes. Gaze steadily. You will perceive the living light of your well-beloved dead in the depths of heaven.‚Äù He knew that faith is wholesome. He sought to counsel and calm the despairing man, by pointing out to him the resigned man, and to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîMONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU MADE HIS CASSOCKS LAST TOO LONG
U||The private life of M. Myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his public life. The voluntary poverty in which the Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî lived, would have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have viewed it close at hand.
U||Like all old men, and like the majority of thinkers, he slept little. This brief slumber was profound. In the morning he meditated for an hour, then he said his mass, either at the cathedral or in his own house. His mass said, he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows. Then he set to work.
U||A Bishop is a very busy man: he must every day receive the secretary of the bishopric, who is generally a canon, and nearly every day his vicars-general. He has congregations to reprove, privileges to grant, a whole ecclesiastical library to examine,‚Äîprayer-books, diocesan catechisms, books of hours, etc.,‚Äîcharges to write, sermons to authorize, cur√©s and mayors to reconcile, a clerical correspondence, an administrative correspondence; on one side the State, on the other the Holy See; and a thousand matters of business.
U||What time was left to him, after these thousand details of business, and his offices and his breviary, he bestowed first on the necessitous, the sick, and the afflicted; the time which was left to him from the afflicted, the sick, and the necessitous, he devoted to work. Sometimes he dug in his garden; again, he read or wrote. He had but one word for both these kinds of toil; he called them gardening. ‚ÄúThe mind is a garden,‚Äù said he.
U||Towards midday, when the weather was fine, he went forth and took a stroll in the country or in town, often entering lowly dwellings. He was seen walking alone, buried in his own thoughts, his eyes cast down, supporting himself on his long cane, clad in his wadded purple garment of silk, which was very warm, wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes, and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points.
U||It was a perfect festival wherever he appeared. One would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it. The children and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as for the sun. He bestowed his blessing, and they blessed him. They pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything.
U||The Comforter
U||Here and there he halted, accosted the little boys and girls, and smiled upon the mothers. He visited the poor so long as he had any money; when he no longer had any, he visited the rich.
U||As he made his cassocks last a long while, and did not wish to have it noticed, he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak. This inconvenienced him somewhat in summer.
U||On his return, he dined. The dinner resembled his breakfast.
U||At half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister, Madame Magloire standing behind them and serving them at table. Nothing could be more frugal than this repast. If, however, the Bishop had one of his cur√©s to supper, Madame Magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve Monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake, or with some fine game from the mountains. Every cur√© furnished the pretext for a good meal: the Bishop did not interfere. With that exception, his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water, and oil soup. Thus it was said in the town, when the Bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cur√©, he indulges in the cheer of a trappist.
U||After supper he conversed for half an hour with Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire; then he retired to his own room and set to writing, sometimes on loose sheets, and again on the margin of some folio. He was a man of letters and rather learned. He left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts; among others, a dissertation on this verse in Genesis, In the beginning, the spirit of God floated upon the waters. With this verse he compares three texts: the Arabic verse which says, The winds of God blew; Flavius Josephus who says, A wind from above was precipitated upon the earth; and finally, the Chaldaic paraphrase of Onkelos, which renders it, A wind coming from God blew upon the face of the waters. In another dissertation, he examines the theological works of Hugo, Bishop of Ptolema√Øs, great-grand-uncle to the writer of this book, and establishes the fact, that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works published during the last century, under the pseudonym of Barleycourt.
U||Sometimes, in the midst of his reading, no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand, he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation, whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself. These lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them. We now have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled Correspondence of Lord Germain with Generals Clinton, Cornwallis, and the Admirals on the American station. Versailles, Poin√ßot, book-seller; and Paris, Pissot, bookseller, Quai des Augustins.
U||Here is the note:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúOh, you who are!
U||‚ÄúEcclesiastes calls you the All-powerful; the Maccabees call you the Creator; the Epistle to the Ephesians calls you liberty; Baruch calls you Immensity; the Psalms call you Wisdom and Truth; John calls you Light; the Books of Kings call you Lord; Exodus calls you Providence; Leviticus, Sanctity; Esdras, Justice; the creation calls you God; man calls you Father; but Solomon calls you Compassion, and that is the most beautiful of all your names.‚Äù
U||Toward nine o‚Äôclock in the evening the two women retired and betook themselves to their chambers on the first floor, leaving him alone until morning on the ground floor.
U||It is necessary that we should, in this place, give an exact idea of the dwelling of the Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîWHO GUARDED HIS HOUSE FOR HIM
U||The house in which he lived consisted, as we have said, of a ground floor, and one story above; three rooms on the ground floor, three chambers on the first, and an attic above. Behind the house was a garden, a quarter of an acre in extent. The two women occupied the first floor; the Bishop was lodged below. The first room, opening on the street, served him as dining-room, the second was his bedroom, and the third his oratory. There was no exit possible from this oratory, except by passing through the bedroom, nor from the bedroom, without passing through the dining-room. At the end of the suite, in the oratory, there was a detached alcove with a bed, for use in cases of hospitality. The Bishop offered this bed to country curates whom business or the requirements of their parishes brought to D‚Äî‚Äî
U||The pharmacy of the hospital, a small building which had been added to the house, and abutted on the garden, had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar. In addition to this, there was in the garden a stable, which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital, and in which the Bishop kept two cows. No matter what the quantity of milk they gave, he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital.
U||‚ÄúI am paying my tithes,‚Äù he said.
U||His bedroom was tolerably large, and rather difficult to warm in bad weather. As wood is extremely dear at D‚Äî‚Äî, he hit upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed. Here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold: he called it his winter salon.
U||In this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood, and four straw-seated chairs. In addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an antique sideboard, painted pink, in water colors. Out of a similar sideboard, properly draped with white napery and imitation lace, the Bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory.
U||His wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D‚Äî‚Äî had more than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for Monseigneur‚Äôs oratory; on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor. ‚ÄúThe most beautiful of altars,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúis the soul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking God.‚Äù
U||In his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an armchair, also in straw, in his bedroom. When, by chance, he received seven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, or the general, or the staff of the regiment in garrison, or several pupils from the little seminary, the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and the armchair from the bedroom: in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors. A room was dismantled for each new guest.
U||It sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party; the Bishop then relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front of the chimney if it was winter, or by strolling in the garden if it was summer.
U||There was still another chair in the detached alcove, but the straw was half gone from it, and it had but three legs, so that it was of service only when propped against the wall. Mademoiselle Baptistine had also in her own room a very large easy-chair of wood, which had formerly been gilded, and which was covered with flowered pekin; but they had been obliged to hoist this berg√®re up to the first story through the window, as the staircase was too narrow; it could not, therefore, be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture.
U||Mademoiselle Baptistine‚Äôs ambition had been to be able to purchase a set of drawing-room furniture in yellow Utrecht velvet, stamped with a rose pattern, and with mahogany in swan‚Äôs neck style, with a sofa. But this would have cost five hundred francs at least, and in view of the fact that she had only been able to lay by forty-two francs and ten sous for this purpose in the course of five years, she had ended by renouncing the idea. However, who is there who has attained his ideal?
U||Nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the Bishop‚Äôs bedchamber. A glazed door opened on the garden; opposite this was the bed,‚Äîa hospital bed of iron, with a canopy of green serge; in the shadow of the bed, behind a curtain, were the utensils of the toilet, which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world: there were two doors, one near the chimney, opening into the oratory; the other near the bookcase, opening into the dining-room. The bookcase was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books; the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble, and habitually without fire. In the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron, ornamented above with two garlanded vases, and flutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf, which was a sort of episcopal luxury; above the chimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper, with the silver worn off, fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen; near the glass door a large tab
U||le with an inkstand, loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes; before the table an armchair of straw; in front of the bed a prie-Dieu, borrowed from the oratory.
U||Two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of the bed. Small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented, one the Abb√© of Chaliot, bishop of Saint Claude; the other, the Abb√© Tourteau, vicar-general of Agde, abb√© of Grand-Champ, order of C√Æteaux, diocese of Chartres. When the Bishop succeeded to this apartment, after the hospital patients, he had found these portraits there, and had left them. They were priests, and probably donors‚Äîtwo reasons for respecting them. All that he knew about these two persons was, that they had been appointed by the king, the one to his bishopric, the other to his benefice, on the same day, the 27th of April, 1785. Madame Magloire having taken the pictures down to dust, the Bishop had discovered these particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper, yellowed by time, and attached to the back of the portrait of the Abb√© of Grand-Champ with four wafers.
U||At his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff, which finally became so old, that, in order to avoid the expense of a new one, Madame Magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it. This seam took the form of a cross. The Bishop often called attention to it: ‚ÄúHow delightful that is!‚Äù he said.
U||All the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals.
U||However, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over, paintings, ornamenting the apartment of Mademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall see further on. Before becoming a hospital, this house had been the ancient parliament house of the Bourgeois. Hence this decoration. The chambers were paved in red bricks, which were washed every week, with straw mats in front of all the beds. Altogether, this dwelling, which was attended to by the two women, was exquisitely clean from top to bottom. This was the sole luxury which the Bishop permitted. He said, ‚ÄúThat takes nothing from the poor.‚Äù
U||It must be confessed, however, that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle, which Madame Magloire contemplated every day with delight, as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth. And since we are now painting the Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî as he was in reality, we must add that he had said more than once, ‚ÄúI find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes.‚Äù
U||To this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver, which he had inherited from a great-aunt. These candlesticks held two wax candles, and usually figured on the Bishop‚Äôs chimney-piece. When he had any one to dinner, Madame Magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table.
U||In the Bishop‚Äôs own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was a small cupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night. But it is necessary to add, that the key was never removed.
U||The garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned, was composed of four alleys in cross-form, radiating from a tank. Another walk made the circuit of the garden, and skirted the white wall which enclosed it. These alleys left behind them four square plots rimmed with box. In three of these, Madame Magloire cultivated vegetables; in the fourth, the Bishop had planted some flowers; here and there stood a few fruit-trees. Madame Magloire had once remarked, with a sort of gentle malice: ‚ÄúMonseigneur, you who turn everything to account, have, nevertheless, one useless plot. It would be better to grow salads there than bouquets.‚Äù ‚ÄúMadame Magloire,‚Äù retorted the Bishop, ‚Äúyou are mistaken. The beautiful is as useful as the useful.‚Äù He added after a pause, ‚ÄúMore so, perhaps.‚Äù
U||This plot, consisting of three or four beds, occupied the Bishop almost as much as did his books. He liked to pass an hour or two there, trimming, hoeing, and making holes here and there in the earth, into which he dropped seeds. He was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him. Moreover, he made no pretensions to botany; he ignored groups and consistency; he made not the slightest effort to decide between Tournefort and the natural method; he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons, nor with Jussieu against Linn√¶us. He did not study plants; he loved flowers. He respected learned men greatly; he respected the ignorant still more; and, without ever failing in these two respects, he watered his flower-beds every summer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green.
U||The house had not a single door which could be locked. The door of the dining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the cathedral square, had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison. The Bishop had had all this ironwork removed, and this door was never fastened, either by night or by day, with anything except the latch. All that the first passer-by had to do at any hour, was to give it a push. At first, the two women had been very much tried by this door, which was never fastened, but Monsieur de D‚Äî‚Äî had said to them, ‚ÄúHave bolts put on your rooms, if that will please you.‚Äù They had ended by sharing his confidence, or by at least acting as though they shared it. Madame Magloire alone had frights from time to time. As for the Bishop, his thought can be found explained, or at least indicated, in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a Bible, ‚ÄúThis is the shade of difference: the door of the physician should never be shut, the door of the priest sho
U||uld always be open.‚Äù
U||On another book, entitled Philosophy of the Medical Science, he had written this other note: ‚ÄúAm not I a physician like them? I also have my patients, and then, too, I have some whom I call my unfortunates.‚Äù
U||Again he wrote: ‚ÄúDo not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you. The very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter.‚Äù
U||It chanced that a worthy cur√©, I know not whether it was the cur√© of Couloubroux or the cur√© of Pompierry, took it into his head to ask him one day, probably at the instigation of Madame Magloire, whether Monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion, to a certain extent, in leaving his door unfastened day and night, at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter, and whether, in short, he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded. The Bishop touched his shoulder, with gentle gravity, and said to him, ‚ÄúNisi Dominus custodierit domum, in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam,‚Äù Unless the Lord guard the house, in vain do they watch who guard it.
U||Then he spoke of something else.
U||He was fond of saying, ‚ÄúThere is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of dragoons,‚Äîonly,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúours must be tranquil.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîCRAVATTE
U||It is here that a fact falls naturally into place, which we must not omit, because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a man the Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî was.
U||After the destruction of the band of Gaspard B√®s, who had infested the gorges of Ollioules, one of his lieutenants, Cravatte, took refuge in the mountains. He concealed himself for some time with his bandits, the remnant of Gaspard B√®s‚Äôs troop, in the county of Nice; then he made his way to Pi√©dmont, and suddenly reappeared in France, in the vicinity of Barcelonette. He was first seen at Jauziers, then at Tuiles. He hid himself in the caverns of the Joug-de-l‚ÄôAigle, and thence he descended towards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of Ubaye and Ubayette.
U||He even pushed as far as Embrun, entered the cathedral one night, and despoiled the sacristy. His highway robberies laid waste the country-side. The gendarmes were set on his track, but in vain. He always escaped; sometimes he resisted by main force. He was a bold wretch. In the midst of all this terror the Bishop arrived. He was making his circuit to Chastelar. The mayor came to meet him, and urged him to retrace his steps. Cravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as Arche, and beyond; there was danger even with an escort; it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose.
U||‚ÄúTherefore,‚Äù said the Bishop, ‚ÄúI intend to go without escort.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou do not really mean that, Monseigneur!‚Äù exclaimed the mayor.
U||‚ÄúI do mean it so thoroughly that I absolutely refuse any gendarmes, and shall set out in an hour.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSet out?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSet out.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAlone?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAlone.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMonseigneur, you will not do that!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThere exists yonder in the mountains,‚Äù said the Bishop, ‚Äúa tiny community no bigger than that, which I have not seen for three years. They are my good friends, those gentle and honest shepherds. They own one goat out of every thirty that they tend. They make very pretty woollen cords of various colors, and they play the mountain airs on little flutes with six holes. They need to be told of the good God now and then. What would they say to a bishop who was afraid? What would they say if I did not go?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut the brigands, Monseigneur?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHold,‚Äù said the Bishop, ‚ÄúI must think of that. You are right. I may meet them. They, too, need to be told of the good God.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut, Monseigneur, there is a band of them! A flock of wolves!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMonsieur le maire, it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that Jesus has constituted me the shepherd. Who knows the ways of Providence?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThey will rob you, Monseigneur.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have nothing.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThey will kill you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAn old goodman of a priest, who passes along mumbling his prayers? Bah! To what purpose?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOh, mon Dieu! what if you should meet them!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI should beg alms of them for my poor.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDo not go, Monseigneur. In the name of Heaven! You are risking your life!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMonsieur le maire,‚Äù said the Bishop, ‚Äúis that really all? I am not in the world to guard my own life, but to guard souls.‚Äù
U||They had to allow him to do as he pleased. He set out, accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide. His obstinacy was bruited about the country-side, and caused great consternation.
U||He would take neither his sister nor Madame Magloire. He traversed the mountain on mule-back, encountered no one, and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his ‚Äúgood friends,‚Äù the shepherds. He remained there for a fortnight, preaching, administering the sacrament, teaching, exhorting. When the time of his departure approached, he resolved to chant a Te Deum pontifically. He mentioned it to the cur√©. But what was to be done? There were no episcopal ornaments. They could only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy, with a few ancient chasubles of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace.
U||‚ÄúBah!‚Äù said the Bishop. ‚ÄúLet us announce our Te Deum from the pulpit, nevertheless, Monsieur le Cur√©. Things will arrange themselves.‚Äù
U||They instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood. All the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly.
U||While they were thus embarrassed, a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the Bishop, by two unknown horsemen, who departed on the instant. The chest was opened; it contained a cope of cloth of gold, a mitre ornamented with diamonds, an archbishop‚Äôs cross, a magnificent crosier,‚Äîall the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of Notre Dame d‚ÄôEmbrun. In the chest was a paper, on which these words were written, ‚ÄúFrom Cravatte to Monseigneur Bienvenu.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDid not I say that things would come right of themselves?‚Äù said the Bishop. Then he added, with a smile, ‚ÄúTo him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMonseigneur,‚Äù murmured the cur√©, throwing back his head with a smile. ‚ÄúGod‚Äîor the Devil.‚Äù
U||The Bishop looked steadily at the cur√©, and repeated with authority, ‚ÄúGod!‚Äù
U||When he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity, all along the road. At the priest‚Äôs house in Chastelar he rejoined Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire, who were waiting for him, and he said to his sister: ‚ÄúWell! was I in the right? The poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands, and he returns from them with his hands full. I set out bearing only my faith in God; I have brought back the treasure of a cathedral.‚Äù
U||That evening, before he went to bed, he said again: ‚ÄúLet us never fear robbers nor murderers. Those are dangers from without, petty dangers. Let us fear ourselves. Prejudices are the real robbers; vices are the real murderers. The great dangers lie within ourselves. What matters it what threatens our head or our purse! Let us think only of that which threatens our soul.‚Äù
U||Then, turning to his sister: ‚ÄúSister, never a precaution on the part of the priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, God permits. Let us confine ourselves to prayer, when we think that a danger is approaching us. Let us pray, not for ourselves, but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account.‚Äù
U||However, such incidents were rare in his life. We relate those of which we know; but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at the same moment. One month of his year resembled one hour of his day.
U||As to what became of ‚Äúthe treasure‚Äù of the cathedral of Embrun, we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction. It consisted of very handsome things, very tempting things, and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate. Stolen they had already been elsewhere. Half of the adventure was completed; it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor. However, we make no assertions on this point. Only, a rather obscure note was found among the Bishop‚Äôs papers, which may bear some relation to this matter, and which is couched in these terms, ‚ÄúThe question is, to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîPHILOSOPHY AFTER DRINKING
U||The senator above mentioned was a clever man, who had made his own way, heedless of those things which present obstacles, and which are called conscience, sworn faith, justice, duty: he had marched straight to his goal, without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest. He was an old attorney, softened by success; not a bad man by any means, who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons, his sons-in-law, his relations, and even to his friends, having wisely seized upon, in life, good sides, good opportunities, good windfalls. Everything else seemed to him very stupid. He was intelligent, and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of Epicurus; while he was, in reality, only a product of Pigault-Lebrun. He laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things, and at the ‚Äúcrotchets of that good old fellow the Bishop.‚Äù He even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel himself, who listened to him.
U||On some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect what, Count*** [this senator] and M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect. At dessert, the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, though still perfectly dignified, exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúEgad, Bishop, let‚Äôs have a discussion. It is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking. We are two augurs. I am going to make a confession to you. I have a philosophy of my own.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd you are right,‚Äù replied the Bishop. ‚ÄúAs one makes one‚Äôs philosophy, so one lies on it. You are on the bed of purple, senator.‚Äù
U||The senator was encouraged, and went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLet us be good fellows.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGood devils even,‚Äù said the Bishop.
U||‚ÄúI declare to you,‚Äù continued the senator, ‚Äúthat the Marquis d‚ÄôArgens, Pyrrhon, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are no rascals. I have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúLike yourself, Count,‚Äù interposed the Bishop.
U||The senator resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI hate Diderot; he is an ideologist, a declaimer, and a revolutionist, a believer in God at bottom, and more bigoted than Voltaire. Voltaire made sport of Needham, and he was wrong, for Needham‚Äôs eels prove that God is useless. A drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux. Suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger; you have the world. Man is the eel. Then what is the good of the Eternal Father? The Jehovah hypothesis tires me, Bishop. It is good for nothing but to produce shallow people, whose reasoning is hollow. Down with that great All, which torments me! Hurrah for Zero which leaves me in peace! Between you and me, and in order to empty my sack, and make confession to my pastor, as it behooves me to do, I will admit to you that I have good sense. I am not enthusiastic over your Jesus, who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity. ‚ÄôTis the counsel of an avaricious man to beggars. Renunciation; why? Sacrifice; to what end? I do not see one wolf im
U||molating himself for the happiness of another wolf. Let us stick to nature, then. We are at the top; let us have a superior philosophy. What is the advantage of being at the top, if one sees no further than the end of other people‚Äôs noses? Let us live merrily. Life is all. That man has another future elsewhere, on high, below, anywhere, I don‚Äôt believe; not one single word of it. Ah! sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me; I must take heed to everything I do; I must cudgel my brains over good and evil, over the just and the unjust, over the fas and the nefas. Why? Because I shall have to render an account of my actions. When? After death. What a fine dream! After my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me. Have a handful of dust seized by a shadow-hand, if you can. Let us tell the truth, we who are initiated, and who have raised the veil of Isis: there is no such thing as either good or evil; there is vegetation. Let us seek the real. Let us get to the bottom of it. Let us go int
U||o it thoroughly. What the deuce! let us go to the bottom of it! We must scent out the truth; dig in the earth for it, and seize it. Then it gives you exquisite joys. Then you grow strong, and you laugh. I am square on the bottom, I am. Immortality, Bishop, is a chance, a waiting for dead men‚Äôs shoes. Ah! what a charming promise! trust to it, if you like! What a fine lot Adam has! We are souls, and we shall be angels, with blue wings on our shoulder-blades. Do come to my assistance: is it not Tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star? Very well. We shall be the grasshoppers of the stars. And then, besides, we shall see God. Ta, ta, ta! What twaddle all these paradises are! God is a nonsensical monster. I would not say that in the Moniteur, egad! but I may whisper it among friends. Inter pocula. To sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow. Be the dupe of the infinite! I‚Äôm not such a fool. I am a nought. I call myself Monsieur le Comte Nought, senator.
U|| Did I exist before my birth? No. Shall I exist after death? No. What am I? A little dust collected in an organism. What am I to do on this earth? The choice rests with me: suffer or enjoy. Whither will suffering lead me? To nothingness; but I shall have suffered. Whither will enjoyment lead me? To nothingness; but I shall have enjoyed myself. My choice is made. One must eat or be eaten. I shall eat. It is better to be the tooth than the grass. Such is my wisdom. After which, go whither I push thee, the grave-digger is there; the Pantheon for some of us: all falls into the great hole. End. Finis. Total liquidation. This is the vanishing-point. Death is death, believe me. I laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell me on that subject. Fables of nurses; bugaboo for children; Jehovah for men. No; our to-morrow is the night. Beyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness. You have been Sardanapalus, you have been Vincent de Paul‚Äîit makes no difference. That is the truth. Then li
U||ve your life, above all things. Make use of your I while you have it. In truth, Bishop, I tell you that I have a philosophy of my own, and I have my philosophers. I don‚Äôt let myself be taken in with that nonsense. Of course, there must be something for those who are down,‚Äîfor the barefooted beggars, knife-grinders, and miserable wretches. Legends, chim√¶ras, the soul, immortality, paradise, the stars, are provided for them to swallow. They gobble it down. They spread it on their dry bread. He who has nothing else has the good God. That is the least he can have. I oppose no objection to that; but I reserve Monsieur Naigeon for myself. The good God is good for the populace.‚Äù
U||The Bishop clapped his hands.
U||‚ÄúThat‚Äôs talking!‚Äù he exclaimed. ‚ÄúWhat an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism! Not every one who wants it can have it. Ah! when one does have it, one is no longer a dupe, one does not stupidly allow one‚Äôs self to be exiled like Cato, nor stoned like Stephen, nor burned alive like Jeanne d‚ÄôArc. Those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible, and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness,‚Äîplaces, sinecures, dignities, power, whether well or ill acquired, lucrative recantations, useful treacheries, savory capitulations of conscience,‚Äîand that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished. How agreeable that is! I do not say that with reference to you, senator. Nevertheless, it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you. You great lords have, so you say, a philosophy of your own, and for yourselves, which is exquisite, refined, accessible to the rich alone, good 
U||for all sauces, and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably. This philosophy has been extracted from the depths, and unearthed by special seekers. But you are good-natured princes, and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good God should constitute the philosophy of the people, very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER IX‚ÄîTHE BROTHER AS DEPICTED BY THE SISTER
U||In order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî, and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions, their thoughts, their feminine instincts even, which are easily alarmed, to the habits and purposes of the Bishop, without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them, we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter from Mademoiselle Baptistine to Madame the Vicomtess de Boischevron, the friend of her childhood. This letter is in our possession.
U||D‚Äî‚Äî, Dec. 16, 18‚Äî.
U||MY GOOD MADAM: Not a day passes without our speaking of you. It is our established custom; but there is another reason besides. Just imagine, while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls, Madam Magloire has made some discoveries; now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over, would not discredit a ch√¢teau in the style of yours. Madam Magloire has pulled off all the paper. There were things beneath. My drawing-room, which contains no furniture, and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing, is fifteen feet in height, eighteen square, with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded, and with beams, as in yours. This was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital. And the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers. But my room is the one you ought to see. Madam Magloire has discovered, under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top, some paintings, which without being good are very tolerable. The subject is Telemachus being knighted by Minerva in some gardens
U||, the name of which escapes me. In short, where the Roman ladies repaired on one single night. What shall I say to you? I have Romans, and Roman ladies [here occurs an illegible word], and the whole train. Madam Magloire has cleaned it all off; this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired, and the whole revarnished, and my chamber will be a regular museum. She has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables of ancient fashion. They asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them, but it is much better to give the money to the poor; and they are very ugly besides, and I should much prefer a round table of mahogany.
U||     I am always very happy. My brother is so good. He gives all he has to the poor and sick. We are very much cramped. The country is trying in the winter, and we really must do something for those who are in need. We are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that these are great treats.
U||     My brother has ways of his own. When he talks, he says that a bishop ought to be so. Just imagine! the door of our house is never fastened. Whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother‚Äôs room. He fears nothing, even at night. That is his sort of bravery, he says.
U||     He does not wish me or Madame Magloire feel any fear for him. He exposes himself to all sorts of dangers, and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it. One must know how to understand him.
U||     He goes out in the rain, he walks in the water, he travels in winter. He fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters, nor night.
U||     Last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers. He would not take us. He was absent for a fortnight. On his return nothing had happened to him; he was thought to be dead, but was perfectly well, and said, ‚ÄúThis is the way I have been robbed!‚Äù And then he opened a trunk full of jewels, all the jewels of the cathedral of Embrun, which the thieves had given him.
U||     When he returned on that occasion, I could not refrain from scolding him a little, taking care, however, not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise, so that no one might hear me.
U||     At first I used to say to myself, ‚ÄúThere are no dangers which will stop him; he is terrible.‚Äù Now I have ended by getting used to it. I make a sign to Madam Magloire that she is not to oppose him. He risks himself as he sees fit. I carry off Madam Magloire, I enter my chamber, I pray for him and fall asleep. I am at ease, because I know that if anything were to happen to him, it would be the end of me. I should go to the good God with my brother and my bishop. It has cost Madam Magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences. But now the habit has been acquired. We pray together, we tremble together, and we fall asleep. If the devil were to enter this house, he would be allowed to do so. After all, what is there for us to fear in this house? There is always some one with us who is stronger than we. The devil may pass through it, but the good God dwells here.
U||     This suffices me. My brother has no longer any need of saying a word to me. I understand him without his speaking, and we abandon ourselves to the care of Providence. That is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul.
U||     I have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the Faux family. You are aware that he knows everything, and that he has memories, because he is still a very good royalist. They really are a very ancient Norman family of the generalship of Caen. Five hundred years ago there was a Raoul de Faux, a Jean de Faux, and a Thomas de Faux, who were gentlemen, and one of whom was a seigneur de Rochefort. The last was Guy-√âtienne-Alexandre, and was commander of a regiment, and something in the light horse of Bretagne. His daughter, Marie-Louise, married Adrien-Charles de Gramont, son of the Duke Louis de Gramont, peer of France, colonel of the French guards, and lieutenant-general of the army. It is written Faux, Fauq, and Faoucq.
U||     Good Madame, recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative, Monsieur the Cardinal. As for your dear Sylvanie, she has done well in not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me. She is well, works as you would wish, and loves me.
U||     That is all that I desire. The souvenir which she sent through you reached me safely, and it makes me very happy. My health is not so very bad, and yet I grow thinner every day. Farewell; my paper is at an end, and this forces me to leave you. A thousand good wishes.
U||BAPTISTINE.
U||P.S. Your grand nephew is charming. Do you know that he will soon be five years old? Yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback who had on knee-caps, and he said, ‚ÄúWhat has he got on his knees?‚Äù He is a charming child! His little brother is dragging an old broom about the room, like a carriage, and saying, ‚ÄúHu!‚Äù
U||As will be perceived from this letter, these two women understood how to mould themselves to the Bishop‚Äôs ways with that special feminine genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself. The Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî, in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him, sometimes did things that were grand, bold, and magnificent, without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact. They trembled, but they let him alone. Sometimes Madame Magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance, but never at the time, nor afterwards. They never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign, in any action once entered upon. At certain moments, without his having occasion to mention it, when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability, so perfect was his simplicity, they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop; then they were nothing more than two shadows in the house. They served him passively; and if obedience consisted in disappearing, they disappeared. They understood, with 
U||an admirable delicacy of instinct, that certain cares may be put under constraint. Thus, even when believing him to be in peril, they understood, I will not say his thought, but his nature, to such a degree that they no longer watched over him. They confided him to God.
U||Moreover, Baptistine said, as we have just read, that her brother‚Äôs end would prove her own. Madame Magloire did not say this, but she knew it.
U||CHAPTER X‚ÄîTHE BISHOP IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNKNOWN LIGHT
U||At an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the preceding pages, he did a thing which, if the whole town was to be believed, was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains infested with bandits.
U||In the country near D‚Äî‚Äî a man lived quite alone. This man, we will state at once, was a former member of the Convention. His name was G‚Äî‚Äî
U||Member of the Convention, G‚Äî‚Äî was mentioned with a sort of horror in the little world of D‚Äî‚Äî A member of the Convention‚Äîcan you imagine such a thing? That existed from the time when people called each other thou, and when they said ‚Äúcitizen.‚Äù This man was almost a monster. He had not voted for the death of the king, but almost. He was a quasi-regicide. He had been a terrible man. How did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a provost‚Äôs court, on the return of the legitimate princes? They need not have cut off his head, if you please; clemency must be exercised, agreed; but a good banishment for life. An example, in short, etc. Besides, he was an atheist, like all the rest of those people. Gossip of the geese about the vulture.
U||Was G‚Äî‚Äî a vulture after all? Yes; if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his. As he had not voted for the death of the king, he had not been included in the decrees of exile, and had been able to remain in France.
U||He dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city, far from any hamlet, far from any road, in some hidden turn of a very wild valley, no one knew exactly where. He had there, it was said, a sort of field, a hole, a lair. There were no neighbors, not even passers-by. Since he had dwelt in that valley, the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass. The locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of a hangman.
U||Nevertheless, the Bishop meditated on the subject, and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the Convention, and he said, ‚ÄúThere is a soul yonder which is lonely.‚Äù
U||And he added, deep in his own mind, ‚ÄúI owe him a visit.‚Äù
U||But, let us avow it, this idea, which seemed natural at the first blush, appeared to him after a moment‚Äôs reflection, as strange, impossible, and almost repulsive. For, at bottom, he shared the general impression, and the old member of the Convention inspired him, without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself, with that sentiment which borders on hate, and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement.
U||Still, should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil? No. But what a sheep!
U||The good Bishop was perplexed. Sometimes he set out in that direction; then he returned.
U||Finally, the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd, who served the member of the Convention in his hovel, had come in quest of a doctor; that the old wretch was dying, that paralysis was gaining on him, and that he would not live over night.‚Äî‚ÄúThank God!‚Äù some added.
U||The Bishop took his staff, put on his cloak, on account of his too threadbare cassock, as we have mentioned, and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon, and set out.
U||The sun was setting, and had almost touched the horizon when the Bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot. With a certain beating of the heart, he recognized the fact that he was near the lair. He strode over a ditch, leaped a hedge, made his way through a fence of dead boughs, entered a neglected paddock, took a few steps with a good deal of boldness, and suddenly, at the extremity of the waste land, and behind lofty brambles, he caught sight of the cavern.
U||It was a very low hut, poor, small, and clean, with a vine nailed against the outside.
U||Near the door, in an old wheel-chair, the armchair of the peasants, there was a white-haired man, smiling at the sun.
U||Near the seated man stood a young boy, the shepherd lad. He was offering the old man a jar of milk.
U||While the Bishop was watching him, the old man spoke: ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI need nothing.‚Äù And his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child.
U||The Bishop stepped forward. At the sound which he made in walking, the old man turned his head, and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life.
U||‚ÄúThis is the first time since I have been here,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúthat any one has entered here. Who are you, sir?‚Äù
U||The Bishop answered:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMy name is Bienvenu Myriel.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBienvenu Myriel? I have heard that name. Are you the man whom the people call Monseigneur Welcome?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am.‚Äù
U||The old man resumed with a half-smile
U||‚ÄúIn that case, you are my bishop?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSomething of that sort.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúEnter, sir.‚Äù
U||The member of the Convention extended his hand to the Bishop, but the Bishop did not take it. The Bishop confined himself to the remark:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am pleased to see that I have been misinformed. You certainly do not seem to me to be ill.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMonsieur,‚Äù replied the old man, ‚ÄúI am going to recover.‚Äù
U||He paused, and then said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI shall die three hours hence.‚Äù
U||Then he continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am something of a doctor; I know in what fashion the last hour draws on. Yesterday, only my feet were cold; to-day, the chill has ascended to my knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; when it reaches the heart, I shall stop. The sun is beautiful, is it not? I had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things. You can talk to me; it does not fatigue me. You have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death. It is well that there should be witnesses at that moment. One has one‚Äôs caprices; I should have liked to last until the dawn, but I know that I shall hardly live three hours. It will be night then. What does it matter, after all? Dying is a simple affair. One has no need of the light for that. So be it. I shall die by starlight.‚Äù
U||The old man turned to the shepherd lad:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGo to thy bed; thou wert awake all last night; thou art tired.‚Äù
U||The child entered the hut.
U||The old man followed him with his eyes, and added, as though speaking to himself:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI shall die while he sleeps. The two slumbers may be good neighbors.‚Äù
U||The Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He did not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the whole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest: he, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at ‚ÄúHis Grace,‚Äù was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and he was almost tempted to retort ‚Äúcitizen.‚Äù He was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but which was not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of the Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the powerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably, the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.
U||Meanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality, in which one could have distinguished, possibly, that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust.
U||The Bishop, on his side, although he generally restrained his curiosity, which, in his opinion, bordered on a fault, could not refrain from examining the member of the Convention with an attention which, as it did not have its course in sympathy, would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A member of the Convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law, even of the law of charity. G‚Äî‚Äî, calm, his body almost upright, his voice vibrating, was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist. The Revolution had many of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof. Though so near to his end, he preserved all the gestures of health. In his clear glance, in his firm tone, in the robust movement of his shoulders, there was something calculated to disconcert death. Azrael, the Mohammedan angel of the sepulchre, would have turned back, and thou
U||ght that he had mistaken the door. G‚Äî‚Äî seemed to be dying because he willed it so. There was freedom in his agony. His legs alone were motionless. It was there that the shadows held him fast. His feet were cold and dead, but his head survived with all the power of life, and seemed full of light. G‚Äî‚Äî, at this solemn moment, resembled the king in that tale of the Orient who was flesh above and marble below.
U||There was a stone there. The Bishop sat down. The exordium was abrupt.
U||‚ÄúI congratulate you,‚Äù said he, in the tone which one uses for a reprimand. ‚ÄúYou did not vote for the death of the king, after all.‚Äù
U||The old member of the Convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words ‚Äúafter all.‚Äù He replied. The smile had quite disappeared from his face.
U||‚ÄúDo not congratulate me too much, sir. I did vote for the death of the tyrant.‚Äù
U||It was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity.
U||‚ÄúWhat do you mean to say?‚Äù resumed the Bishop.
U||‚ÄúI mean to say that man has a tyrant,‚Äîignorance. I voted for the death of that tyrant. That tyrant engendered royalty, which is authority falsely understood, while science is authority rightly understood. Man should be governed only by science.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd conscience,‚Äù added the Bishop.
U||‚ÄúIt is the same thing. Conscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us.‚Äù
U||Monseigneur Bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language, which was very new to him.
U||The member of the Convention resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSo far as Louis XVI. was concerned, I said ‚Äòno.‚Äô I did not think that I had the right to kill a man; but I felt it my duty to exterminate evil. I voted the end of the tyrant, that is to say, the end of prostitution for woman, the end of slavery for man, the end of night for the child. In voting for the Republic, I voted for that. I voted for fraternity, concord, the dawn. I have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and errors. The crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light. We have caused the fall of the old world, and the old world, that vase of miseries, has become, through its upsetting upon the human race, an urn of joy.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMixed joy,‚Äù said the Bishop.
U||‚ÄúYou may say troubled joy, and to-day, after that fatal return of the past, which is called 1814, joy which has disappeared! Alas! The work was incomplete, I admit: we demolished the ancient regime in deeds; we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas. To destroy abuses is not sufficient; customs must be modified. The mill is there no longer; the wind is still there.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou have demolished. It may be of use to demolish, but I distrust a demolition complicated with wrath.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúRight has its wrath, Bishop; and the wrath of right is an element of progress. In any case, and in spite of whatever may be said, the French Revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of Christ. Incomplete, it may be, but sublime. It set free all the unknown social quantities; it softened spirits, it calmed, appeased, enlightened; it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth. It was a good thing. The French Revolution is the consecration of humanity.‚Äù
U||The Bishop could not refrain from murmuring:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYes? ‚Äô93!‚Äù
U||The member of the Convention straightened himself up in his chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity, and exclaimed, so far as a dying man is capable of exclamation:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAh, there you go; ‚Äô93! I was expecting that word. A cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years; at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst. You are putting the thunderbolt on its trial.‚Äù
U||The Bishop felt, without, perhaps, confessing it, that something within him had suffered extinction. Nevertheless, he put a good face on the matter. He replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe judge speaks in the name of justice; the priest speaks in the name of pity, which is nothing but a more lofty justice. A thunderbolt should commit no error.‚Äù And he added, regarding the member of the Convention steadily the while, ‚ÄúLouis XVII.?‚Äù
U||The conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the Bishop‚Äôs arm.
U||‚ÄúLouis XVII.! let us see. For whom do you mourn? is it for the innocent child? very good; in that case I mourn with you. Is it for the royal child? I demand time for reflection. To me, the brother of Cartouche, an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the Place de Gr√®ve, until death ensued, for the sole crime of having been the brother of Cartouche, is no less painful than the grandson of Louis XV., an innocent child, martyred in the tower of the Temple, for the sole crime of having been grandson of Louis XV.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMonsieur,‚Äù said the Bishop, ‚ÄúI like not this conjunction of names.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCartouche? Louis XV.? To which of the two do you object?‚Äù
U||A momentary silence ensued. The Bishop almost regretted having come, and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken.
U||The conventionary resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAh, Monsieur Priest, you love not the crudities of the true. Christ loved them. He seized a rod and cleared out the Temple. His scourge, full of lightnings, was a harsh speaker of truths. When he cried, ‚ÄòSinite parvulos,‚Äô he made no distinction between the little children. It would not have embarrassed him to bring together the Dauphin of Barabbas and the Dauphin of Herod. Innocence, Monsieur, is its own crown. Innocence has no need to be a highness. It is as august in rags as in fleurs de lys.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is true,‚Äù said the Bishop in a low voice.
U||‚ÄúI persist,‚Äù continued the conventionary G‚Äî‚Äî ‚ÄúYou have mentioned Louis XVII. to me. Let us come to an understanding. Shall we weep for all the innocent, all martyrs, all children, the lowly as well as the exalted? I agree to that. But in that case, as I have told you, we must go back further than ‚Äô93, and our tears must begin before Louis XVII. I will weep with you over the children of kings, provided that you will weep with me over the children of the people.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI weep for all,‚Äù said the Bishop.
U||‚ÄúEqually!‚Äù exclaimed conventionary G‚Äî‚Äî; ‚Äúand if the balance must incline, let it be on the side of the people. They have been suffering longer.‚Äù
U||Another silence ensued. The conventionary was the first to break it. He raised himself on one elbow, took a bit of his cheek between his thumb and his forefinger, as one does mechanically when one interrogates and judges, and appealed to the Bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of the death agony. It was almost an explosion.
U||‚ÄúYes, sir, the people have been suffering a long while. And hold! that is not all, either; why have you just questioned me and talked to me about Louis XVII.? I know you not. Ever since I have been in these parts I have dwelt in this enclosure alone, never setting foot outside, and seeing no one but that child who helps me. Your name has reached me in a confused manner, it is true, and very badly pronounced, I must admit; but that signifies nothing: clever men have so many ways of imposing on that honest goodman, the people. By the way, I did not hear the sound of your carriage; you have left it yonder, behind the coppice at the fork of the roads, no doubt. I do not know you, I tell you. You have told me that you are the Bishop; but that affords me no information as to your moral personality. In short, I repeat my question. Who are you? You are a bishop; that is to say, a prince of the church, one of those gilded men with heraldic bearings and revenues, who have vast prebends,‚Äîthe bishopric of D‚Äî‚Äî fi
U||fteen thousand francs settled income, ten thousand in perquisites; total, twenty-five thousand francs,‚Äîwho have kitchens, who have liveries, who make good cheer, who eat moor-hens on Friday, who strut about, a lackey before, a lackey behind, in a gala coach, and who have palaces, and who roll in their carriages in the name of Jesus Christ who went barefoot! You are a prelate,‚Äîrevenues, palace, horses, servants, good table, all the sensualities of life; you have this like the rest, and like the rest, you enjoy it; it is well; but this says either too much or too little; this does not enlighten me upon the intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable intention of bringing wisdom to me. To whom do I speak? Who are you?‚Äù
U||The Bishop hung his head and replied, ‚ÄúVermis sum‚ÄîI am a worm.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA worm of the earth in a carriage?‚Äù growled the conventionary.
U||It was the conventionary‚Äôs turn to be arrogant, and the Bishop‚Äôs to be humble.
U||The Bishop resumed mildly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSo be it, sir. But explain to me how my carriage, which is a few paces off behind the trees yonder, how my good table and the moor-hens which I eat on Friday, how my twenty-five thousand francs income, how my palace and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty, and that ‚Äô93 was not inexorable.‚Äù
U||The conventionary passed his hand across his brow, as though to sweep away a cloud.
U||‚ÄúBefore replying to you,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI beseech you to pardon me. I have just committed a wrong, sir. You are at my house, you are my guest, I owe you courtesy. You discuss my ideas, and it becomes me to confine myself to combating your arguments. Your riches and your pleasures are advantages which I hold over you in the debate; but good taste dictates that I shall not make use of them. I promise you to make no use of them in the future.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI thank you,‚Äù said the Bishop.
U||G‚Äî‚Äî resumed.
U||‚ÄúLet us return to the explanation which you have asked of me. Where were we? What were you saying to me? That ‚Äô93 was inexorable?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúInexorable; yes,‚Äù said the Bishop. ‚ÄúWhat think you of Marat clapping his hands at the guillotine?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat think you of Bossuet chanting the Te Deum over the dragonnades?‚Äù
U||The retort was a harsh one, but it attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel. The Bishop quivered under it; no reply occurred to him; but he was offended by this mode of alluding to Bossuet. The best of minds will have their fetiches, and they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic.
U||The conventionary began to pant; the asthma of the agony which is mingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice; still, there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes. He went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLet me say a few words more in this and that direction; I am willing. Apart from the Revolution, which, taken as a whole, is an immense human affirmation, ‚Äô93 is, alas! a rejoinder. You think it inexorable, sir; but what of the whole monarchy, sir? Carrier is a bandit; but what name do you give to Montrevel? Fouquier-Tainville is a rascal; but what is your opinion as to Lamoignon-B√¢ville? Maillard is terrible; but Saulx-Tavannes, if you please? Duch√™ne senior is ferocious; but what epithet will you allow me for the elder Letellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Tet√™ is a monster; but not so great a one as M. the Marquis de Louvois. Sir, sir, I am sorry for Marie Antoinette, archduchess and queen; but I am also sorry for that poor Huguenot woman, who, in 1685, under Louis the Great, sir, while with a nursing infant, was bound, naked to the waist, to a stake, and the child kept at a distance; her breast swelled with milk and her heart with anguish; the little one, hungry and pale, beheld that breast and cried and agon
U||ized; the executioner said to the woman, a mother and a nurse, ‚ÄòAbjure!‚Äô giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the death of her conscience. What say you to that torture of Tantalus as applied to a mother? Bear this well in mind sir: the French Revolution had its reasons for existence; its wrath will be absolved by the future; its result is the world made better. From its most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the human race. I abridge, I stop, I have too much the advantage; moreover, I am dying.‚Äù
U||And ceasing to gaze at the Bishop, the conventionary concluded his thoughts in these tranquil words:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYes, the brutalities of progress are called revolutions. When they are over, this fact is recognized,‚Äîthat the human race has been treated harshly, but that it has progressed.‚Äù
U||The conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all the inmost intrenchments of the Bishop. One remained, however, and from this intrenchment, the last resource of Monseigneur Bienvenu‚Äôs resistance, came forth this reply, wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúProgress should believe in God. Good cannot have an impious servitor. He who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race.‚Äù
U||The former representative of the people made no reply. He was seized with a fit of trembling. He looked towards heaven, and in his glance a tear gathered slowly. When the eyelid was full, the tear trickled down his livid cheek, and he said, almost in a stammer, quite low, and to himself, while his eyes were plunged in the depths:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúO thou! O ideal! Thou alone existest!‚Äù
U||The Bishop experienced an indescribable shock.
U||After a pause, the old man raised a finger heavenward and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe infinite is. He is there. If the infinite had no person, person would be without limit; it would not be infinite; in other words, it would not exist. There is, then, an I. That I of the infinite is God.‚Äù
U||The dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice, and with the shiver of ecstasy, as though he beheld some one. When he had spoken, his eyes closed. The effort had exhausted him. It was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him. That which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death. The supreme moment was approaching.
U||The Bishop understood this; time pressed; it was as a priest that he had come: from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion; he gazed at those closed eyes, he took that wrinkled, aged and ice-cold hand in his, and bent over the dying man.
U||‚ÄúThis hour is the hour of God. Do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain?‚Äù
U||The conventionary opened his eyes again. A gravity mingled with gloom was imprinted on his countenance.
U||‚ÄúBishop,‚Äù said he, with a slowness which probably arose more from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength, ‚ÄúI have passed my life in meditation, study, and contemplation. I was sixty years of age when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs. I obeyed. Abuses existed, I combated them; tyrannies existed, I destroyed them; rights and principles existed, I proclaimed and confessed them. Our territory was invaded, I defended it; France was menaced, I offered my breast. I was not rich; I am poor. I have been one of the masters of the state; the vaults of the treasury were encumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls, which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and silver; I dined in Dead Tree Street, at twenty-two sous. I have succored the oppressed, I have comforted the suffering. I tore the cloth from the altar, it is true; but it was to bind up the wounds of my country. I have always upheld the march
U|| forward of the human race, forward towards the light, and I have sometimes resisted progress without pity. I have, when the occasion offered, protected my own adversaries, men of your profession. And there is at Peteghem, in Flanders, at the very spot where the Merovingian kings had their summer palace, a convent of Urbanists, the Abbey of Sainte Claire en Beaulieu, which I saved in 1793. I have done my duty according to my powers, and all the good that I was able. After which, I was hunted down, pursued, persecuted, blackened, jeered at, scorned, cursed, proscribed. For many years past, I with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they have the right to despise me; to the poor ignorant masses I present the visage of one damned. And I accept this isolation of hatred, without hating any one myself. Now I am eighty-six years old; I am on the point of death. What is it that you have come to ask of me?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYour blessing,‚Äù said the Bishop.
U||And he knelt down.
U||When the Bishop raised his head again, the face of the conventionary had become august. He had just expired.
U||The Bishop returned home, deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannot be known to us. He passed the whole night in prayer. On the following morning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about member of the Convention G‚Äî‚Äî; he contented himself with pointing heavenward.
U||From that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers.
U||Any allusion to ‚Äúthat old wretch of a G‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù caused him to fall into a singular preoccupation. No one could say that the passage of that soul before his, and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his, did not count for something in his approach to perfection.
U||This ‚Äúpastoral visit‚Äù naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coteries.
U||‚ÄúWas the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop? There was evidently no conversion to be expected. All those revolutionists are backsliders. Then why go there? What was there to be seen there? He must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried off by the devil.‚Äù
U||One day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself spiritual, addressed this sally to him, ‚ÄúMonseigneur, people are inquiring when Your Greatness will receive the red cap!‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúOh! oh! that‚Äôs a coarse color,‚Äù replied the Bishop. ‚ÄúIt is lucky that those who despise it in a cap revere it in a hat.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER XI‚ÄîA RESTRICTION
U||We should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves, were we to conclude from this that Monseigneur Welcome was ‚Äúa philosophical bishop,‚Äù or a ‚Äúpatriotic cur√©.‚Äù His meeting, which may almost be designated as his union, with conventionary G‚Äî‚Äî, left behind it in his mind a sort of astonishment, which rendered him still more gentle. That is all.
U||Although Monseigneur Bienvenu was far from being a politician, this is, perhaps, the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the events of that epoch, supposing that Monseigneur Bienvenu ever dreamed of having an attitude.
U||Let us, then, go back a few years.
U||Some time after the elevation of M. Myriel to the episcopate, the Emperor had made him a baron of the Empire, in company with many other bishops. The arrest of the Pope took place, as every one knows, on the night of the 5th to the 6th of July, 1809; on this occasion, M. Myriel was summoned by Napoleon to the synod of the bishops of France and Italy convened at Paris. This synod was held at Notre-Dame, and assembled for the first time on the 15th of June, 1811, under the presidency of Cardinal Fesch. M. Myriel was one of the ninety-five bishops who attended it. But he was present only at one sitting and at three or four private conferences. Bishop of a mountain diocese, living so very close to nature, in rusticity and deprivation, it appeared that he imported among these eminent personages, ideas which altered the temperature of the assembly. He very soon returned to D‚Äî‚Äî He was interrogated as to this speedy return, and he replied: ‚ÄúI embarrassed them. The outside air penetrated to them through me. I p
U||roduced on them the effect of an open door.‚Äù
U||On another occasion he said, ‚ÄúWhat would you have? Those gentlemen are princes. I am only a poor peasant bishop.‚Äù
U||The fact is that he displeased them. Among other strange things, it is said that he chanced to remark one evening, when he found himself at the house of one of his most notable colleagues: ‚ÄúWhat beautiful clocks! What beautiful carpets! What beautiful liveries! They must be a great trouble. I would not have all those superfluities, crying incessantly in my ears: ‚ÄòThere are people who are hungry! There are people who are cold! There are poor people! There are poor people!‚Äô‚Äù
U||Let us remark, by the way, that the hatred of luxury is not an intelligent hatred. This hatred would involve the hatred of the arts. Nevertheless, in churchmen, luxury is wrong, except in connection with representations and ceremonies. It seems to reveal habits which have very little that is charitable about them. An opulent priest is a contradiction. The priest must keep close to the poor. Now, can one come in contact incessantly night and day with all this distress, all these misfortunes, and this poverty, without having about one‚Äôs own person a little of that misery, like the dust of labor? Is it possible to imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm? Can one imagine a workman who is working near a furnace, and who has neither a singed hair, nor blackened nails, nor a drop of sweat, nor a speck of ashes on his face? The first proof of charity in the priest, in the bishop especially, is poverty.
U||This is, no doubt, what the Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî thought.
U||It must not be supposed, however, that he shared what we call the ‚Äúideas of the century‚Äù on certain delicate points. He took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment, and maintained silence on questions in which Church and State were implicated; but if he had been strongly pressed, it seems that he would have been found to be an ultramontane rather than a gallican. Since we are making a portrait, and since we do not wish to conceal anything, we are forced to add that he was glacial towards Napoleon in his decline. Beginning with 1813, he gave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations. He refused to see him, as he passed through on his return from the island of Elba, and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the Emperor in his diocese during the Hundred Days.
U||Besides his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, he had two brothers, one a general, the other a prefect. He wrote to both with tolerable frequency. He was harsh for a time towards the former, because, holding a command in Provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at Cannes, the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the Emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing to escape. His correspondence with the other brother, the ex-prefect, a fine, worthy man who lived in retirement at Paris, Rue Cassette, remained more affectionate.
U||Thus Monseigneur Bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit, his hour of bitterness, his cloud. The shadow of the passions of the moment traversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things. Certainly, such a man would have done well not to entertain any political opinions. Let there be no mistake as to our meaning: we are not confounding what is called ‚Äúpolitical opinions‚Äù with the grand aspiration for progress, with the sublime faith, patriotic, democratic, humane, which in our day should be the very foundation of every generous intellect. Without going deeply into questions which are only indirectly connected with the subject of this book, we will simply say this: It would have been well if Monseigneur Bienvenu had not been a Royalist, and if his glance had never been, for a single instant, turned away from that serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible, above the fictions and the hatreds of this world, above the stormy vicissitudes of human things, the beaming of those th
U||ree pure radiances, truth, justice, and charity.
U||While admitting that it was not for a political office that God created Monseigneur Welcome, we should have understood and admired his protest in the name of right and liberty, his proud opposition, his just but perilous resistance to the all-powerful Napoleon. But that which pleases us in people who are rising pleases us less in the case of people who are falling. We only love the fray so long as there is danger, and in any case, the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be the exterminators of the last. He who has not been a stubborn accuser in prosperity should hold his peace in the face of ruin. The denunciator of success is the only legitimate executioner of the fall. As for us, when Providence intervenes and strikes, we let it work. 1812 commenced to disarm us. In 1813 the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn legislative body, emboldened by catastrophe, possessed only traits which aroused indignation. And it was a crime to applaud, in 1814, in the presence of those marshals who be
U||trayed; in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another, insulting after having deified; in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol,‚Äîit was a duty to turn aside the head. In 1815, when the supreme disasters filled the air, when France was seized with a shiver at their sinister approach, when Waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before Napoleon, the mournful acclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it, and, after making all allowance for the despot, a heart like that of the Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî, ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink of the abyss.
U||With this exception, he was in all things just, true, equitable, intelligent, humble and dignified, beneficent and kindly, which is only another sort of benevolence. He was a priest, a sage, and a man. It must be admitted, that even in the political views with which we have just reproached him, and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity, he was tolerant and easy, more so, perhaps, than we who are speaking here. The porter of the town-hall had been placed there by the Emperor. He was an old non-commissioned officer of the old guard, a member of the Legion of Honor at Austerlitz, as much of a Bonapartist as the eagle. This poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks, which the law then stigmatized as seditious speeches. After the imperial profile disappeared from the Legion of Honor, he never dressed himself in his regimentals, as he said, so that he should not be obliged to wear his cross. He had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross which Napoleon had given him;
U|| this made a hole, and he would not put anything in its place. ‚ÄúI will die,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúrather than wear the three frogs upon my heart!‚Äù He liked to scoff aloud at Louis XVIII. ‚ÄúThe gouty old creature in English gaiters!‚Äù he said; ‚Äúlet him take himself off to Prussia with that queue of his.‚Äù He was happy to combine in the same imprecation the two things which he most detested, Prussia and England. He did it so often that he lost his place. There he was, turned out of the house, with his wife and children, and without bread. The Bishop sent for him, reproved him gently, and appointed him beadle in the cathedral.
U||In the course of nine years Monseigneur Bienvenu had, by dint of holy deeds and gentle manners, filled the town of D‚Äî‚Äîwith a sort of tender and filial reverence. Even his conduct towards Napoleon had been accepted and tacitly pardoned, as it were, by the people, the good and weakly flock who adored their emperor, but loved their bishop.
U||CHAPTER XII‚ÄîTHE SOLITUDE OF MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME
U||A bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little abb√©s, just as a general is by a covey of young officers. This is what that charming Saint Fran√ßois de Sales calls somewhere ‚Äúles pr√™tres blancs-becs,‚Äù callow priests. Every career has its aspirants, who form a train for those who have attained eminence in it. There is no power which has not its dependents. There is no fortune which has not its court. The seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present. Every metropolis has its staff of officials. Every bishop who possesses the least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary, which goes the round, and maintains good order in the episcopal palace, and mounts guard over monseigneur‚Äôs smile. To please a bishop is equivalent to getting one‚Äôs foot in the stirrup for a sub-diaconate. It is necessary to walk one‚Äôs path discreetly; the apostleship does not disdain the canonship.
U||Just as there are bigwigs elsewhere, there are big mitres in the Church. These are the bishops who stand well at Court, who are rich, well endowed, skilful, accepted by the world, who know how to pray, no doubt, but who know also how to beg, who feel little scruple at making a whole diocese dance attendance in their person, who are connecting links between the sacristy and diplomacy, who are abb√©s rather than priests, prelates rather than bishops. Happy those who approach them! Being persons of influence, they create a shower about them, upon the assiduous and the favored, and upon all the young men who understand the art of pleasing, of large parishes, prebends, archidiaconates, chaplaincies, and cathedral posts, while awaiting episcopal honors. As they advance themselves, they cause their satellites to progress also; it is a whole solar system on the march. Their radiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite. Their prosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes, into nice little promotions. The larger th
U||e diocese of the patron, the fatter the curacy for the favorite. And then, there is Rome. A bishop who understands how to become an archbishop, an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal, carries you with him as conclavist; you enter a court of papal jurisdiction, you receive the pallium, and behold! you are an auditor, then a papal chamberlain, then monsignor, and from a Grace to an Eminence is only a step, and between the Eminence and the Holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot. Every skull-cap may dream of the tiara. The priest is nowadays the only man who can become a king in a regular manner; and what a king! the supreme king. Then what a nursery of aspirations is a seminary! How many blushing choristers, how many youthful abb√©s bear on their heads Perrette‚Äôs pot of milk! Who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation? in good faith, perchance, and deceiving itself, devotee that it is.
U||Monseigneur Bienvenu, poor, humble, retiring, was not accounted among the big mitres. This was plain from the complete absence of young priests about him. We have seen that he ‚Äúdid not take‚Äù in Paris. Not a single future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man. Not a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow. His canons and grand-vicars were good old men, rather vulgar like himself, walled up like him in this diocese, without exit to a cardinalship, and who resembled their bishop, with this difference, that they were finished and he was completed. The impossibility of growing great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so well understood, that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix or of Auch, and went off in a great hurry. For, in short, we repeat it, men wish to be pushed. A saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor; he might communicate
U|| to you, by contagion, an incurable poverty, an anchylosis of the joints, which are useful in advancement, and in short, more renunciation than you desire; and this infectious virtue is avoided. Hence the isolation of Monseigneur Bienvenu. We live in the midst of a gloomy society. Success; that is the lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption.
U||Be it said in passing, that success is a very hideous thing. Its false resemblance to merit deceives men. For the masses, success has almost the same profile as supremacy. Success, that Men√¶chmus of talent, has one dupe,‚Äîhistory. Juvenal and Tacitus alone grumble at it. In our day, a philosophy which is almost official has entered into its service, wears the livery of success, and performs the service of its antechamber. Succeed: theory. Prosperity argues capacity. Win in the lottery, and behold! you are a clever man. He who triumphs is venerated. Be born with a silver spoon in your mouth! everything lies in that. Be lucky, and you will have all the rest; be happy, and people will think you great. Outside of five or six immense exceptions, which compose the splendor of a century, contemporary admiration is nothing but short-sightedness. Gilding is gold. It does no harm to be the first arrival by pure chance, so long as you do arrive. The common herd is an old Narcissus who adores himself, and who applauds
U|| the vulgar herd. That enormous ability by virtue of which one is Moses, √Üschylus, Dante, Michael Angelo, or Napoleon, the multitude awards on the spot, and by acclamation, to whomsoever attains his object, in whatsoever it may consist. Let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy: let a false Corneille compose Tiridate; let a eunuch come to possess a harem; let a military Prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch; let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe-soles for the army of the Sambre-and-Meuse, and construct for himself, out of this cardboard, sold as leather, four hundred thousand francs of income; let a pork-packer espouse usury, and cause it to bring forth seven or eight millions, of which he is the father and of which it is the mother; let a preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl; let the steward of a fine family be so rich on retiring from service that he is made minister of finances,‚Äîand men call that Genius, just as they call the face of Mousqueton Beauty, and th
U||e mien of Claude Majesty. With the constellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which are made in the soft mire of the puddle by the feet of ducks.
U||CHAPTER XIII‚ÄîWHAT HE BELIEVED
U||We are not obliged to sound the Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî on the score of orthodoxy. In the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect. The conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word. Moreover, certain natures being given, we admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own.
U||What did he think of this dogma, or of that mystery? These secrets of the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb, where souls enter naked. The point on which we are certain is, that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case. No decay is possible to the diamond. He believed to the extent of his powers. ‚ÄúCredo in Patrem,‚Äù he often exclaimed. Moreover, he drew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience, and which whispers to a man, ‚ÄúThou art with God!‚Äù
U||The point which we consider it our duty to note is, that outside of and beyond his faith, as it were, the Bishop possessed an excess of love. It was in that quarter, quia multum amavit,‚Äîbecause he loved much‚Äîthat he was regarded as vulnerable by ‚Äúserious men,‚Äù ‚Äúgrave persons‚Äù and ‚Äúreasonable people‚Äù; favorite locutions of our sad world where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry. What was this excess of love? It was a serene benevolence which overflowed men, as we have already pointed out, and which, on occasion, extended even to things. He lived without disdain. He was indulgent towards God‚Äôs creation. Every man, even the best, has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves for animals. The Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî had none of that harshness, which is peculiar to many priests, nevertheless. He did not go as far as the Brahmin, but he seemed to have weighed this saying of Ecclesiastes: ‚ÄúWho knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth?‚Äù Hideousness of aspect, deformity of i
U||nstinct, troubled him not, and did not arouse his indignation. He was touched, almost softened by them. It seemed as though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of life which is apparent, the cause, the explanation, or the excuse for them. He seemed at times to be asking God to commute these penalties. He examined without wrath, and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering a palimpsest, that portion of chaos which still exists in nature. This reverie sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings. One morning he was in his garden, and thought himself alone, but his sister was walking behind him, unseen by him: suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground; it was a large, black, hairy, frightful spider. His sister heard him say:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúPoor beast! It is not its fault!‚Äù
U||Why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness? Puerile they may be; but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to Saint Francis d‚ÄôAssisi and of Marcus Aurelius. One day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant. Thus lived this just man. Sometimes he fell asleep in his garden, and then there was nothing more venerable possible.
U||Monseigneur Bienvenu had formerly been, if the stories anent his youth, and even in regard to his manhood, were to be believed, a passionate, and, possibly, a violent man. His universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life, and had trickled there slowly, thought by thought; for, in a character, as in a rock, there may exist apertures made by drops of water. These hollows are uneffaceable; these formations are indestructible.
U||In 1815, as we think we have already said, he reached his seventy-fifth birthday, but he did not appear to be more than sixty. He was not tall; he was rather plump; and, in order to combat this tendency, he was fond of taking long strolls on foot; his step was firm, and his form was but slightly bent, a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion. Gregory XVI., at the age of eighty, held himself erect and smiling, which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop. Monseigneur Welcome had what the people term a ‚Äúfine head,‚Äù but so amiable was he that they forgot that it was fine.
U||When he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms, and of which we have already spoken, people felt at their ease with him, and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person. His fresh and ruddy complexion, his very white teeth, all of which he had preserved, and which were displayed by his smile, gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a good fellow‚Äù; and of an old man, ‚ÄúHe is a fine man.‚Äù That, it will be recalled, was the effect which he produced upon Napoleon. On the first encounter, and to one who saw him for the first time, he was nothing, in fact, but a fine man. But if one remained near him for a few hours, and beheld him in the least degree pensive, the fine man became gradually transfigured, and took on some imposing quality, I know not what; his broad and serious brow, rendered august by his white locks, became august also by virtue of meditation; majesty radiated from his goodness, though his goodness ceased not to be radian
U||t; one experienced something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings, without ceasing to smile. Respect, an unutterable respect, penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your heart, and one felt that one had before him one of those strong, thoroughly tried, and indulgent souls where thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle.
U||As we have seen, prayer, the celebration of the offices of religion, alms-giving, the consolation of the afflicted, the cultivation of a bit of land, fraternity, frugality, hospitality, renunciation, confidence, study, work, filled every day of his life. Filled is exactly the word; certainly the Bishop‚Äôs day was quite full to the brim, of good words and good deeds. Nevertheless, it was not complete if cold or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed, and after the two women had retired. It seemed to be a sort of rite with him, to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens. Sometimes, if the two old women were not asleep, they heard him pacing slowly along the walks at a very advanced hour of the night. He was there alone, communing with himself, peaceful, adoring, comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether, moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations 
U||and the invisible splendor of God, opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the Unknown. At such moments, while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume, illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night, as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation, he could not have told himself, probably, what was passing in his spirit; he felt something take its flight from him, and something descend into him. Mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe!
U||He thought of the grandeur and presence of God; of the future eternity, that strange mystery; of the eternity past, a mystery still more strange; of all the infinities, which pierced their way into all his senses, beneath his eyes; and, without seeking to comprehend the incomprehensible, he gazed upon it. He did not study God; he was dazzled by him. He considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms, which communicate aspects to matter, reveal forces by verifying them, create individualities in unity, proportions in extent, the innumerable in the infinite, and, through light, produce beauty. These conjunctions are formed and dissolved incessantly; hence life and death.
U||He seated himself on a wooden bench, with his back against a decrepit vine; he gazed at the stars, past the puny and stunted silhouettes of his fruit-trees. This quarter of an acre, so poorly planted, so encumbered with mean buildings and sheds, was dear to him, and satisfied his wants.
U||What more was needed by this old man, who divided the leisure of his life, where there was so little leisure, between gardening in the daytime and contemplation at night? Was not this narrow enclosure, with the heavens for a ceiling, sufficient to enable him to adore God in his most divine works, in turn? Does not this comprehend all, in fact? and what is there left to desire beyond it? A little garden in which to walk, and immensity in which to dream. At one‚Äôs feet that which can be cultivated and plucked; over head that which one can study and meditate upon: some flowers on earth, and all the stars in the sky.
U||CHAPTER XIV‚ÄîWHAT HE THOUGHT
U||One last word.
U||Since this sort of details might, particularly at the present moment, and to use an expression now in fashion, give to the Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî a certain ‚Äúpantheistical‚Äù physiognomy, and induce the belief, either to his credit or discredit, that he entertained one of those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century, which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits, and there take on a form and grow until they usurp the place of religion, we insist upon it, that not one of those persons who knew Monseigneur Welcome would have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort. That which enlightened this man was his heart. His wisdom was made of the light which comes from there.
U||No systems; many works. Abstruse speculations contain vertigo; no, there is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses. The apostle may be daring, but the bishop must be timid. He would probably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain problems which are, in a manner, reserved for terrible great minds. There is a sacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma; those gloomy openings stand yawning there, but something tells you, you, a passer-by in life, that you must not enter. Woe to him who penetrates thither!
U||Geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure speculation, situated, so to speak, above all dogmas, propose their ideas to God. Their prayer audaciously offers discussion. Their adoration interrogates. This is direct religion, which is full of anxiety and responsibility for him who attempts its steep cliffs.
U||Human meditation has no limits. At his own risk and peril, it analyzes and digs deep into its own bedazzlement. One might almost say, that by a sort of splendid reaction, it with it dazzles nature; the mysterious world which surrounds us renders back what it has received; it is probable that the contemplators are contemplated. However that may be, there are on earth men who‚Äîare they men?‚Äîperceive distinctly at the verge of the horizons of reverie the heights of the absolute, and who have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain. Monseigneur Welcome was one of these men; Monseigneur Welcome was not a genius. He would have feared those sublimities whence some very great men even, like Swedenborg and Pascal, have slipped into insanity. Certainly, these powerful reveries have their moral utility, and by these arduous paths one approaches to ideal perfection. As for him, he took the path which shortens,‚Äîthe Gospel‚Äôs.
U||He did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of Elijah‚Äôs mantle; he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of events; he did not see to condense in flame the light of things; he had nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him. This humble soul loved, and that was all.
U||That he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is probable: but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much; and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts, Saint Theresa and Saint Jerome would be heretics.
U||He inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates. The universe appeared to him like an immense malady; everywhere he felt fever, everywhere he heard the sound of suffering, and, without seeking to solve the enigma, he strove to dress the wound. The terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him; he was occupied only in finding for himself, and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and relieve. That which exists was for this good and rare priest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation.
U||There are men who toil at extracting gold; he toiled at the extraction of pity. Universal misery was his mine. The sadness which reigned everywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness. Love each other; he declared this to be complete, desired nothing further, and that was the whole of his doctrine. One day, that man who believed himself to be a ‚Äúphilosopher,‚Äù the senator who has already been alluded to, said to the Bishop: ‚ÄúJust survey the spectacle of the world: all war against all; the strongest has the most wit. Your love each other is nonsense.‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúWell,‚Äù replied Monseigneur Welcome, without contesting the point, ‚Äúif it is nonsense, the soul should shut itself up in it, as the pearl in the oyster.‚Äù Thus he shut himself up, he lived there, he was absolutely satisfied with it, leaving on one side the prodigious questions which attract and terrify, the fathomless perspectives of abstraction, the precipices of metaphysics‚Äîall those profundities which converge, for the apostle in God, f
U||or the atheist in nothingness; destiny, good and evil, the way of being against being, the conscience of man, the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal, the transformation in death, the recapitulation of existences which the tomb contains, the incomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the persistent I, the essence, the substance, the Nile, and the Ens, the soul, nature, liberty, necessity; perpendicular problems, sinister obscurities, where lean the gigantic archangels of the human mind; formidable abysses, which Lucretius, Manou, Saint Paul, Dante, contemplate with eyes flashing lightning, which seems by its steady gaze on the infinite to cause stars to blaze forth there.
U||Monseigneur Bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of mysterious questions without scrutinizing them, and without troubling his own mind with them, and who cherished in his own soul a grave respect for darkness.
U||BOOK SECOND‚ÄîTHE FALL
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîTHE EVENING OF A DAY OF WALKING
U||Early in the month of October, 1815, about an hour before sunset, a man who was travelling on foot entered the little town of D‚Äî‚Äî The few inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness. It was difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance. He was a man of medium stature, thickset and robust, in the prime of life. He might have been forty-six or forty-eight years old. A cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face, burned and tanned by sun and wind, and dripping with perspiration. His shirt of coarse yellow linen, fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitted a view of his hairy breast: he had a cravat twisted into a string; trousers of blue drilling, worn and threadbare, white on one knee and torn on the other; an old gray, tattered blouse, patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with twine; a tightly packed soldier knapsack, well buckled and perfectly new, on h
U||is back; an enormous, knotty stick in his hand; iron-shod shoes on his stockingless feet; a shaved head and a long beard.
U||The sweat, the heat, the journey on foot, the dust, added I know not what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole. His hair was closely cut, yet bristling, for it had begun to grow a little, and did not seem to have been cut for some time.
U||No one knew him. He was evidently only a chance passer-by. Whence came he? From the south; from the seashore, perhaps, for he made his entrance into D‚Äî‚Äî by the same street which, seven months previously, had witnessed the passage of the Emperor Napoleon on his way from Cannes to Paris. This man must have been walking all day. He seemed very much fatigued. Some women of the ancient market town which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard Gassendi, and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade. He must have been very thirsty: for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink, two hundred paces further on, at the fountain in the market-place.
U||On arriving at the corner of the Rue Poichevert, he turned to the left, and directed his steps toward the town-hall. He entered, then came out a quarter of an hour later. A gendarme was seated near the door, on the stone bench which General Drouot had mounted on the 4th of March to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of D‚Äî‚Äî the proclamation of the Gulf Juan. The man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the gendarme.
U||The gendarme, without replying to his salute, stared attentively at him, followed him for a while with his eyes, and then entered the town-hall.
U||There then existed at D‚Äî‚Äî a fine inn at the sign of the Cross of Colbas. This inn had for a landlord a certain Jacquin Labarre, a man of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another Labarre, who kept the inn of the Three Dauphins in Grenoble, and had served in the Guides. At the time of the Emperor‚Äôs landing, many rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the Three Dauphins. It was said that General Bertrand, disguised as a carter, had made frequent trips thither in the month of January, and that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls of gold to the citizens. The truth is, that when the Emperor entered Grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture; he had thanked the mayor, saying, ‚ÄúI am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance‚Äù; and he had betaken himself to the Three Dauphins. This glory of the Labarre of the Three Dauphins was reflected upon the Labarre of the Cross of Colbas, a
U||t a distance of five and twenty leagues. It was said of him in the town, ‚ÄúThat is the cousin of the man of Grenoble.‚Äù
U||The man bent his steps towards this inn, which was the best in the country-side. He entered the kitchen, which opened on a level with the street. All the stoves were lighted; a huge fire blazed gayly in the fireplace. The host, who was also the chief cook, was going from one stew-pan to another, very busily superintending an excellent dinner designed for the wagoners, whose loud talking, conversation, and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment. Any one who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoners. A fat marmot, flanked by white partridges and heather-cocks, was turning on a long spit before the fire; on the stove, two huge carps from Lake Lauzet and a trout from Lake Alloz were cooking.
U||The host, hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter, said, without raising his eyes from his stoves:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat do you wish, sir?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFood and lodging,‚Äù said the man.
U||‚ÄúNothing easier,‚Äù replied the host. At that moment he turned his head, took in the traveller‚Äôs appearance with a single glance, and added, ‚ÄúBy paying for it.‚Äù
U||The man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse, and answered, ‚ÄúI have money.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn that case, we are at your service,‚Äù said the host.
U||The man put his purse back in his pocket, removed his knapsack from his back, put it on the ground near the door, retained his stick in his hand, and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire. D‚Äî‚Äî is in the mountains. The evenings are cold there in October.
U||But as the host went back and forth, he scrutinized the traveller.
U||‚ÄúWill dinner be ready soon?‚Äù said the man.
U||‚ÄúImmediately,‚Äù replied the landlord.
U||While the newcomer was warming himself before the fire, with his back turned, the worthy host, Jacquin Labarre, drew a pencil from his pocket, then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small table near the window. On the white margin he wrote a line or two, folded it without sealing, and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lackey. The landlord whispered a word in the scullion‚Äôs ear, and the child set off on a run in the direction of the town-hall.
U||The traveller saw nothing of all this.
U||Once more he inquired, ‚ÄúWill dinner be ready soon?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúImmediately,‚Äù responded the host.
U||The child returned. He brought back the paper. The host unfolded it eagerly, like a person who is expecting a reply. He seemed to read it attentively, then tossed his head, and remained thoughtful for a moment. Then he took a step in the direction of the traveller, who appeared to be immersed in reflections which were not very serene.
U||‚ÄúI cannot receive you, sir,‚Äù said he.
U||The man half rose.
U||‚ÄúWhat! Are you afraid that I will not pay you? Do you want me to pay you in advance? I have money, I tell you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt is not that.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat then?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou have money‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the man.
U||‚ÄúAnd I,‚Äù said the host, ‚Äúhave no room.‚Äù
U||The man resumed tranquilly, ‚ÄúPut me in the stable.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI cannot.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe horses take up all the space.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúVery well!‚Äù retorted the man; ‚Äúa corner of the loft then, a truss of straw. We will see about that after dinner.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI cannot give you any dinner.‚Äù
U||This declaration, made in a measured but firm tone, struck the stranger as grave. He rose.
U||‚ÄúAh! bah! But I am dying of hunger. I have been walking since sunrise. I have travelled twelve leagues. I pay. I wish to eat.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have nothing,‚Äù said the landlord.
U||The man burst out laughing, and turned towards the fireplace and the stoves: ‚ÄúNothing! and all that?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAll that is engaged.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBy whom?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBy messieurs the wagoners.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHow many are there of them?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTwelve.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThere is enough food there for twenty.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThey have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance.‚Äù
U||The man seated himself again, and said, without raising his voice, ‚ÄúI am at an inn; I am hungry, and I shall remain.‚Äù
U||Then the host bent down to his ear, and said in a tone which made him start, ‚ÄúGo away!‚Äù
U||At that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brands into the fire with the iron-shod tip of his staff; he turned quickly round, and as he opened his mouth to reply, the host gazed steadily at him and added, still in a low voice: ‚ÄúStop! there‚Äôs enough of that sort of talk. Do you want me to tell you your name? Your name is Jean Valjean. Now do you want me to tell you who you are? When I saw you come in I suspected something; I sent to the town-hall, and this was the reply that was sent to me. Can you read?‚Äù
U||So saying, he held out to the stranger, fully unfolded, the paper which had just travelled from the inn to the town-hall, and from the town-hall to the inn. The man cast a glance upon it. The landlord resumed after a pause.
U||‚ÄúI am in the habit of being polite to every one. Go away!‚Äù
U||The man dropped his head, picked up the knapsack which he had deposited on the ground, and took his departure.
U||He chose the principal street. He walked straight on at a venture, keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man. He did not turn round a single time. Had he done so, he would have seen the host of the Cross of Colbas standing on his threshold, surrounded by all the guests of his inn, and all the passers-by in the street, talking vivaciously, and pointing him out with his finger; and, from the glances of terror and distrust cast by the group, he might have divined that his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town.
U||He saw nothing of all this. People who are crushed do not look behind them. They know but too well the evil fate which follows them.
U||Thus he proceeded for some time, walking on without ceasing, traversing at random streets of which he knew nothing, forgetful of his fatigue, as is often the case when a man is sad. All at once he felt the pangs of hunger sharply. Night was drawing near. He glanced about him, to see whether he could not discover some shelter.
U||The fine hostelry was closed to him; he was seeking some very humble public house, some hovel, however lowly.
U||Just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets; a pine branch suspended from a cross-beam of iron was outlined against the white sky of the twilight. He proceeded thither.
U||It proved to be, in fact, a public house. The public house which is in the Rue de Chaffaut.
U||The wayfarer halted for a moment, and peeped through the window into the interior of the low-studded room of the public house, illuminated by a small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth. Some men were engaged in drinking there. The landlord was warming himself. An iron pot, suspended from a crane, bubbled over the flame.
U||The entrance to this public house, which is also a sort of an inn, is by two doors. One opens on the street, the other upon a small yard filled with manure. The traveller dare not enter by the street door. He slipped into the yard, halted again, then raised the latch timidly and opened the door.
U||‚ÄúWho goes there?‚Äù said the master.
U||‚ÄúSome one who wants supper and bed.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGood. We furnish supper and bed here.‚Äù
U||He entered. All the men who were drinking turned round. The lamp illuminated him on one side, the firelight on the other. They examined him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack.
U||The host said to him, ‚ÄúThere is the fire. The supper is cooking in the pot. Come and warm yourself, comrade.‚Äù
U||He approached and seated himself near the hearth. He stretched out his feet, which were exhausted with fatigue, to the fire; a fine odor was emitted by the pot. All that could be distinguished of his face, beneath his cap, which was well pulled down, assumed a vague appearance of comfort, mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual suffering bestows.
U||It was, moreover, a firm, energetic, and melancholy profile. This physiognomy was strangely composed; it began by seeming humble, and ended by seeming severe. The eye shone beneath its lashes like a fire beneath brushwood.
U||One of the men seated at the table, however, was a fishmonger who, before entering the public house of the Rue de Chaffaut, had been to stable his horse at Labarre‚Äôs. It chanced that he had that very morning encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between Bras d‚ÄôAsse and‚ÄîI have forgotten the name. I think it was Escoublon. Now, when he met him, the man, who then seemed already extremely weary, had requested him to take him on his crupper; to which the fishmonger had made no reply except by redoubling his gait. This fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded Jacquin Labarre, and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the Cross of Colbas. From where he sat he made an imperceptible sign to the tavern-keeper. The tavern-keeper went to him. They exchanged a few words in a low tone. The man had again become absorbed in his reflections.
U||The tavern-keeper returned to the fireplace, laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man, and said to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou are going to get out of here.‚Äù
U||The stranger turned round and replied gently, ‚ÄúAh! You know?‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI was sent away from the other inn.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd you are to be turned out of this one.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhere would you have me go?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúElsewhere.‚Äù
U||The man took his stick and his knapsack and departed.
U||As he went out, some children who had followed him from the Cross of Colbas, and who seemed to be lying in wait for him, threw stones at him. He retraced his steps in anger, and threatened them with his stick: the children dispersed like a flock of birds.
U||He passed before the prison. At the door hung an iron chain attached to a bell. He rang.
U||The wicket opened.
U||‚ÄúTurnkey,‚Äù said he, removing his cap politely, ‚Äúwill you have the kindness to admit me, and give me a lodging for the night?‚Äù
U||A voice replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe prison is not an inn. Get yourself arrested, and you will be admitted.‚Äù
U||The wicket closed again.
U||He entered a little street in which there were many gardens. Some of them are enclosed only by hedges, which lends a cheerful aspect to the street. In the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a small house of a single story, the window of which was lighted up. He peered through the pane as he had done at the public house. Within was a large whitewashed room, with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff, and a cradle in one corner, a few wooden chairs, and a double-barrelled gun hanging on the wall. A table was spread in the centre of the room. A copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the pewter jug shining like silver, and filled with wine, and the brown, smoking soup-tureen. At this table sat a man of about forty, with a merry and open countenance, who was dandling a little child on his knees. Close by a very young woman was nursing another child. The father was laughing, the child was laughing, the mother was smiling.
U||The stranger paused a moment in reverie before this tender and calming spectacle. What was taking place within him? He alone could have told. It is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospitable, and that, in a place where he beheld so much happiness, he would find perhaps a little pity.
U||He tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock.
U||They did not hear him.
U||He tapped again.
U||He heard the woman say, ‚ÄúIt seems to me, husband, that some one is knocking.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù replied the husband.
U||He tapped a third time.
U||The husband rose, took the lamp, and went to the door, which he opened.
U||He was a man of lofty stature, half peasant, half artisan. He wore a huge leather apron, which reached to his left shoulder, and which a hammer, a red handkerchief, a powder-horn, and all sorts of objects which were upheld by the girdle, as in a pocket, caused to bulge out. He carried his head thrown backwards; his shirt, widely opened and turned back, displayed his bull neck, white and bare. He had thick eyelashes, enormous black whiskers, prominent eyes, the lower part of his face like a snout; and besides all this, that air of being on his own ground, which is indescribable.
U||‚ÄúPardon me, sir,‚Äù said the wayfarer, ‚ÄúCould you, in consideration of payment, give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in the garden, in which to sleep? Tell me; can you? For money?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù demanded the master of the house.
U||The man replied: ‚ÄúI have just come from Puy-Moisson. I have walked all day long. I have travelled twelve leagues. Can you?‚Äîif I pay?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI would not refuse,‚Äù said the peasant, ‚Äúto lodge any respectable man who would pay me. But why do you not go to the inn?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThere is no room.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBah! Impossible. This is neither a fair nor a market day. Have you been to Labarre?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù
U||The traveller replied with embarrassment: ‚ÄúI do not know. He did not receive me.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHave you been to What‚Äôs-his-name‚Äôs, in the Rue Chaffaut?‚Äù
U||The stranger‚Äôs embarrassment increased; he stammered, ‚ÄúHe did not receive me either.‚Äù
U||The peasant‚Äôs countenance assumed an expression of distrust; he surveyed the newcomer from head to feet, and suddenly exclaimed, with a sort of shudder:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAre you the man?‚Äî‚Äù
U||He cast a fresh glance upon the stranger, took three steps backwards, placed the lamp on the table, and took his gun down from the wall.
U||Meanwhile, at the words, Are you the man? the woman had risen, had clasped her two children in her arms, and had taken refuge precipitately behind her husband, staring in terror at the stranger, with her bosom uncovered, and with frightened eyes, as she murmured in a low tone, ‚ÄúTso-maraude.‚Äù1
U||All this took place in less time than it requires to picture it to one‚Äôs self. After having scrutinized the man for several moments, as one scrutinizes a viper, the master of the house returned to the door and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúClear out!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFor pity‚Äôs sake, a glass of water,‚Äù said the man.
U||‚ÄúA shot from my gun!‚Äù said the peasant.
U||Then he closed the door violently, and the man heard him shoot two large bolts. A moment later, the window-shutter was closed, and the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside.
U||Night continued to fall. A cold wind from the Alps was blowing. By the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived, in one of the gardens which bordered the street, a sort of hut, which seemed to him to be built of sods. He climbed over the wooden fence resolutely, and found himself in the garden. He approached the hut; its door consisted of a very low and narrow aperture, and it resembled those buildings which road-laborers construct for themselves along the roads. He thought without doubt, that it was, in fact, the dwelling of a road-laborer; he was suffering from cold and hunger, but this was, at least, a shelter from the cold. This sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night. He threw himself flat on his face, and crawled into the hut. It was warm there, and he found a tolerably good bed of straw. He lay, for a moment, stretched out on this bed, without the power to make a movement, so fatigued was he. Then, as the knapsack on his back was in his way, and as it furnished, moreover, a pillow re
U||ady to his hand, he set about unbuckling one of the straps. At that moment, a ferocious growl became audible. He raised his eyes. The head of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut.
U||It was a dog‚Äôs kennel.
U||He was himself vigorous and formidable; he armed himself with his staff, made a shield of his knapsack, and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could, not without enlarging the rents in his rags.
U||He left the garden in the same manner, but backwards, being obliged, in order to keep the dog respectful, to have recourse to that man≈ìuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as la rose couverte.
U||When he had, not without difficulty, repassed the fence, and found himself once more in the street, alone, without refuge, without shelter, without a roof over his head, chased even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel, he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone, and it appears that a passer-by heard him exclaim, ‚ÄúI am not even a dog!‚Äù
U||He soon rose again and resumed his march. He went out of the town, hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford him shelter.
U||He walked thus for some time, with his head still drooping. When he felt himself far from every human habitation, he raised his eyes and gazed searchingly about him. He was in a field. Before him was one of those low hills covered with close-cut stubble, which, after the harvest, resemble shaved heads.
U||The horizon was perfectly black. This was not alone the obscurity of night; it was caused by very low-hanging clouds which seemed to rest upon the hill itself, and which were mounting and filling the whole sky. Meanwhile, as the moon was about to rise, and as there was still floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight, these clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch, whence a gleam of light fell upon the earth.
U||The earth was thus better lighted than the sky, which produces a particularly sinister effect, and the hill, whose contour was poor and mean, was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon. The whole effect was hideous, petty, lugubrious, and narrow.
U||There was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree, which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer.
U||This man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious aspects of things; nevertheless, there was something in that sky, in that hill, in that plain, in that tree, which was so profoundly desolate, that after a moment of immobility and reverie he turned back abruptly. There are instants when nature seems hostile.
U||He retraced his steps; the gates of D‚Äî‚Äî were closed. D‚Äî‚Äî, which had sustained sieges during the wars of religion, was still surrounded in 1815 by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been demolished since. He passed through a breach and entered the town again.
U||It might have been eight o‚Äôclock in the evening. As he was not acquainted with the streets, he recommenced his walk at random.
U||In this way he came to the prefecture, then to the seminary. As he passed through the Cathedral Square, he shook his fist at the church.
U||At the corner of this square there is a printing establishment. It is there that the proclamations of the Emperor and of the Imperial Guard to the army, brought from the Island of Elba and dictated by Napoleon himself, were printed for the first time.
U||Worn out with fatigue, and no longer entertaining any hope, he lay down on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office.
U||At that moment an old woman came out of the church. She saw the man stretched out in the shadow. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing there, my friend?‚Äù said she.
U||He answered harshly and angrily: ‚ÄúAs you see, my good woman, I am sleeping.‚Äù The good woman, who was well worthy the name, in fact, was the Marquise de R‚Äî‚Äî
U||‚ÄúOn this bench?‚Äù she went on.
U||‚ÄúI have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years,‚Äù said the man; ‚Äúto-day I have a mattress of stone.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou have been a soldier?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, my good woman, a soldier.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy do you not go to the inn?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBecause I have no money.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAlas!‚Äù said Madame de R‚Äî‚Äî, ‚ÄúI have only four sous in my purse.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGive it to me all the same.‚Äù
U||The man took the four sous. Madame de R‚Äî‚Äî continued: ‚ÄúYou cannot obtain lodgings in an inn for so small a sum. But have you tried? It is impossible for you to pass the night thus. You are cold and hungry, no doubt. Some one might have given you a lodging out of charity.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have knocked at all doors.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have been driven away everywhere.‚Äù
U||The ‚Äúgood woman‚Äù touched the man‚Äôs arm, and pointed out to him on the other side of the street a small, low house, which stood beside the Bishop‚Äôs palace.
U||‚ÄúYou have knocked at all doors?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHave you knocked at that one?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúKnock there.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîPRUDENCE COUNSELLED TO WISDOM.
U||That evening, the Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî, after his promenade through the town, remained shut up rather late in his room. He was busy over a great work on Duties, which was never completed, unfortunately. He was carefully compiling everything that the Fathers and the doctors have said on this important subject. His book was divided into two parts: firstly, the duties of all; secondly, the duties of each individual, according to the class to which he belongs. The duties of all are the great duties. There are four of these. Saint Matthew points them out: duties towards God (Matt. vi.); duties towards one‚Äôs self (Matt. v. 29, 30); duties towards one‚Äôs neighbor (Matt. vii. 12); duties towards animals (Matt. vi. 20, 25). As for the other duties the Bishop found them pointed out and prescribed elsewhere: to sovereigns and subjects, in the Epistle to the Romans; to magistrates, to wives, to mothers, to young men, by Saint Peter; to husbands, fathers, children and servants, in the Epistle to the Ephesians; to the fai
U||thful, in the Epistle to the Hebrews; to virgins, in the Epistle to the Corinthians. Out of these precepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole, which he desired to present to souls.
U||At eight o‚Äôclock he was still at work, writing with a good deal of inconvenience upon little squares of paper, with a big book open on his knees, when Madame Magloire entered, according to her wont, to get the silver-ware from the cupboard near his bed. A moment later, the Bishop, knowing that the table was set, and that his sister was probably waiting for him, shut his book, rose from his table, and entered the dining-room.
U||The dining-room was an oblong apartment, with a fireplace, which had a door opening on the street (as we have said), and a window opening on the garden.
U||Madame Magloire was, in fact, just putting the last touches to the table.
U||As she performed this service, she was conversing with Mademoiselle Baptistine.
U||A lamp stood on the table; the table was near the fireplace. A wood fire was burning there.
U||One can easily picture to one‚Äôs self these two women, both of whom were over sixty years of age. Madame Magloire small, plump, vivacious; Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller than her brother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of 1806, which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which had lasted ever since. To borrow vulgar phrases, which possess the merit of giving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly suffice to express, Madame Magloire had the air of a peasant, and Mademoiselle Baptistine that of a lady. Madame Magloire wore a white quilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck, the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, a very white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff, with large, short sleeves, an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks, knotted round the waist with a green ribbon, with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins at the upper c
U||orners, coarse shoes on her feet, and yellow stockings, like the women of Marseilles. Mademoiselle Baptistine‚Äôs gown was cut on the patterns of 1806, with a short waist, a narrow, sheath-like skirt, puffed sleeves, with flaps and buttons. She concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig. Madame Magloire had an intelligent, vivacious, and kindly air; the two corners of her mouth unequally raised, and her upper lip, which was larger than the lower, imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious look. So long as Monseigneur held his peace, she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom; but as soon as Monseigneur began to speak, as we have seen, she obeyed passively like her mistress. Mademoiselle Baptistine did not even speak. She confined herself to obeying and pleasing him. She had never been pretty, even when she was young; she had large, blue, prominent eyes, and a long arched nose; but her whole visage, her whole person, breathed forth an ineffable goodness, as w
U||e stated in the beginning. She had always been predestined to gentleness; but faith, charity, hope, those three virtues which mildly warm the soul, had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity. Nature had made her a lamb, religion had made her an angel. Poor sainted virgin! Sweet memory which has vanished!
U||Mademoiselle Baptistine has so often narrated what passed at the episcopal residence that evening, that there are many people now living who still recall the most minute details.
U||At the moment when the Bishop entered, Madame Magloire was talking with considerable vivacity. She was haranguing Mademoiselle Baptistine on a subject which was familiar to her and to which the Bishop was also accustomed. The question concerned the lock upon the entrance door.
U||It appears that while procuring some provisions for supper, Madame Magloire had heard things in divers places. People had spoken of a prowler of evil appearance; a suspicious vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about the town, and those who should take it into their heads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasant encounters. The police was very badly organized, moreover, because there was no love lost between the Prefect and the Mayor, who sought to injure each other by making things happen. It behooved wise people to play the part of their own police, and to guard themselves well, and care must be taken to duly close, bar and barricade their houses, and to fasten the doors well.
U||Madame Magloire emphasized these last words; but the Bishop had just come from his room, where it was rather cold. He seated himself in front of the fire, and warmed himself, and then fell to thinking of other things. He did not take up the remark dropped with design by Madame Magloire. She repeated it. Then Mademoiselle Baptistine, desirous of satisfying Madame Magloire without displeasing her brother, ventured to say timidly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDid you hear what Madame Magloire is saying, brother?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have heard something of it in a vague way,‚Äù replied the Bishop. Then half-turning in his chair, placing his hands on his knees, and raising towards the old servant woman his cordial face, which so easily grew joyous, and which was illuminated from below by the firelight,‚Äî‚ÄúCome, what is the matter? What is the matter? Are we in any great danger?‚Äù
U||Then Madame Magloire began the whole story afresh, exaggerating it a little without being aware of the fact. It appeared that a Bohemian, a bare-footed vagabond, a sort of dangerous mendicant, was at that moment in the town. He had presented himself at Jacquin Labarre‚Äôs to obtain lodgings, but the latter had not been willing to take him in. He had been seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard Gassendi and roam about the streets in the gloaming. A gallows-bird with a terrible face.
U||‚ÄúReally!‚Äù said the Bishop.
U||This willingness to interrogate encouraged Madame Magloire; it seemed to her to indicate that the Bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed; she pursued triumphantly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYes, Monseigneur. That is how it is. There will be some sort of catastrophe in this town to-night. Every one says so. And withal, the police is so badly regulated‚Äù (a useful repetition). ‚ÄúThe idea of living in a mountainous country, and not even having lights in the streets at night! One goes out. Black as ovens, indeed! And I say, Monseigneur, and Mademoiselle there says with me‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI,‚Äù interrupted his sister, ‚Äúsay nothing. What my brother does is well done.‚Äù
U||Madame Magloire continued as though there had been no protest:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWe say that this house is not safe at all; that if Monseigneur will permit, I will go and tell Paulin Musebois, the locksmith, to come and replace the ancient locks on the doors; we have them, and it is only the work of a moment; for I say that nothing is more terrible than a door which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first passer-by; and I say that we need bolts, Monseigneur, if only for this night; moreover, Monseigneur has the habit of always saying ‚Äòcome in‚Äô; and besides, even in the middle of the night, O mon Dieu! there is no need to ask permission.‚Äù
U||At that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door.
U||‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù said the Bishop.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîTHE HEROISM OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE.
U||The door opened.
U||It opened wide with a rapid movement, as though some one had given it an energetic and resolute push.
U||A man entered.
U||We already know the man. It was the wayfarer whom we have seen wandering about in search of shelter.
U||He entered, advanced a step, and halted, leaving the door open behind him. He had his knapsack on his shoulders, his cudgel in his hand, a rough, audacious, weary, and violent expression in his eyes. The fire on the hearth lighted him up. He was hideous. It was a sinister apparition.
U||Madame Magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry. She trembled, and stood with her mouth wide open.
U||Mademoiselle Baptistine turned round, beheld the man entering, and half started up in terror; then, turning her head by degrees towards the fireplace again, she began to observe her brother, and her face became once more profoundly calm and serene.
U||The Bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man.
U||As he opened his mouth, doubtless to ask the newcomer what he desired, the man rested both hands on his staff, directed his gaze at the old man and the two women, and without waiting for the Bishop to speak, he said, in a loud voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSee here. My name is Jean Valjean. I am a convict from the galleys. I have passed nineteen years in the galleys. I was liberated four days ago, and am on my way to Pontarlier, which is my destination. I have been walking for four days since I left Toulon. I have travelled a dozen leagues to-day on foot. This evening, when I arrived in these parts, I went to an inn, and they turned me out, because of my yellow passport, which I had shown at the town-hall. I had to do it. I went to an inn. They said to me, ‚ÄòBe off,‚Äô at both places. No one would take me. I went to the prison; the jailer would not admit me. I went into a dog‚Äôs kennel; the dog bit me and chased me off, as though he had been a man. One would have said that he knew who I was. I went into the fields, intending to sleep in the open air, beneath the stars. There were no stars. I thought it was going to rain, and I re-entered the town, to seek the recess of a doorway. Yonder, in the square, I meant to sleep on a stone bench. A good woman point
U||ed out your house to me, and said to me, ‚ÄòKnock there!‚Äô I have knocked. What is this place? Do you keep an inn? I have money‚Äîsavings. One hundred and nine francs fifteen sous, which I earned in the galleys by my labor, in the course of nineteen years. I will pay. What is that to me? I have money. I am very weary; twelve leagues on foot; I am very hungry. Are you willing that I should remain?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMadame Magloire,‚Äù said the Bishop, ‚Äúyou will set another place.‚Äù
U||The man advanced three paces, and approached the lamp which was on the table. ‚ÄúStop,‚Äù he resumed, as though he had not quite understood; ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not it. Did you hear? I am a galley-slave; a convict. I come from the galleys.‚Äù He drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow paper, which he unfolded. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs my passport. Yellow, as you see. This serves to expel me from every place where I go. Will you read it? I know how to read. I learned in the galleys. There is a school there for those who choose to learn. Hold, this is what they put on this passport: ‚ÄòJean Valjean, discharged convict, native of‚Äô‚Äîthat is nothing to you‚Äî‚Äòhas been nineteen years in the galleys: five years for house-breaking and burglary; fourteen years for having attempted to escape on four occasions. He is a very dangerous man.‚Äô There! Every one has cast me out. Are you willing to receive me? Is this an inn? Will you give me something to eat and a bed? Have you a stable?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMadame Magloire,‚Äù said the Bishop, ‚Äúyou will put white sheets on the bed in the alcove.‚Äù We have already explained the character of the two women‚Äôs obedience.
U||Madame Magloire retired to execute these orders.
U||The Bishop turned to the man.
U||‚ÄúSit down, sir, and warm yourself. We are going to sup in a few moments, and your bed will be prepared while you are supping.‚Äù
U||At this point the man suddenly comprehended. The expression of his face, up to that time sombre and harsh, bore the imprint of stupefaction, of doubt, of joy, and became extraordinary. He began stammering like a crazy man:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúReally? What! You will keep me? You do not drive me forth? A convict! You call me sir! You do not address me as thou? ‚ÄòGet out of here, you dog!‚Äô is what people always say to me. I felt sure that you would expel me, so I told you at once who I am. Oh, what a good woman that was who directed me hither! I am going to sup! A bed with a mattress and sheets, like the rest of the world! a bed! It is nineteen years since I have slept in a bed! You actually do not want me to go! You are good people. Besides, I have money. I will pay well. Pardon me, monsieur the inn-keeper, but what is your name? I will pay anything you ask. You are a fine man. You are an inn-keeper, are you not?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am,‚Äù replied the Bishop, ‚Äúa priest who lives here.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA priest!‚Äù said the man. ‚ÄúOh, what a fine priest! Then you are not going to demand any money of me? You are the cur√©, are you not? the cur√© of this big church? Well! I am a fool, truly! I had not perceived your skull-cap.‚Äù
U||As he spoke, he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner, replaced his passport in his pocket, and seated himself. Mademoiselle Baptistine gazed mildly at him. He continued:
U||‚ÄúYou are humane, Monsieur le Cur√©; you have not scorned me. A good priest is a very good thing. Then you do not require me to pay?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said the Bishop; ‚Äúkeep your money. How much have you? Did you not tell me one hundred and nine francs?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd fifteen sous,‚Äù added the man.
U||‚ÄúOne hundred and nine francs fifteen sous. And how long did it take you to earn that?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNineteen years.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNineteen years!‚Äù
U||The Bishop sighed deeply.
U||The man continued: ‚ÄúI have still the whole of my money. In four days I have spent only twenty-five sous, which I earned by helping unload some wagons at Grasse. Since you are an abb√©, I will tell you that we had a chaplain in the galleys. And one day I saw a bishop there. Monseigneur is what they call him. He was the Bishop of Majore at Marseilles. He is the cur√© who rules over the other cur√©s, you understand. Pardon me, I say that very badly; but it is such a far-off thing to me! You understand what we are! He said mass in the middle of the galleys, on an altar. He had a pointed thing, made of gold, on his head; it glittered in the bright light of midday. We were all ranged in lines on the three sides, with cannons with lighted matches facing us. We could not see very well. He spoke; but he was too far off, and we did not hear. That is what a bishop is like.‚Äù
U||While he was speaking, the Bishop had gone and shut the door, which had remained wide open.
U||Madame Magloire returned. She brought a silver fork and spoon, which she placed on the table.
U||‚ÄúMadame Magloire,‚Äù said the Bishop, ‚Äúplace those things as near the fire as possible.‚Äù And turning to his guest: ‚ÄúThe night wind is harsh on the Alps. You must be cold, sir.‚Äù
U||Each time that he uttered the word sir, in his voice which was so gently grave and polished, the man‚Äôs face lighted up. Monsieur to a convict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the Medusa. Ignominy thirsts for consideration.
U||‚ÄúThis lamp gives a very bad light,‚Äù said the Bishop.
U||Madame Magloire understood him, and went to get the two silver candlesticks from the chimney-piece in Monseigneur‚Äôs bed-chamber, and placed them, lighted, on the table.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur le Cur√©,‚Äù said the man, ‚Äúyou are good; you do not despise me. You receive me into your house. You light your candles for me. Yet I have not concealed from you whence I come and that I am an unfortunate man.‚Äù
U||The Bishop, who was sitting close to him, gently touched his hand. ‚ÄúYou could not help telling me who you were. This is not my house; it is the house of Jesus Christ. This door does not demand of him who enters whether he has a name, but whether he has a grief. You suffer, you are hungry and thirsty; you are welcome. And do not thank me; do not say that I receive you in my house. No one is at home here, except the man who needs a refuge. I say to you, who are passing by, that you are much more at home here than I am myself. Everything here is yours. What need have I to know your name? Besides, before you told me you had one which I knew.‚Äù
U||The man opened his eyes in astonishment.
U||‚ÄúReally? You knew what I was called?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied the Bishop, ‚Äúyou are called my brother.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúStop, Monsieur le Cur√©,‚Äù exclaimed the man. ‚ÄúI was very hungry when I entered here; but you are so good, that I no longer know what has happened to me.‚Äù
U||The Bishop looked at him, and said,‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou have suffered much?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOh, the red coat, the ball on the ankle, a plank to sleep on, heat, cold, toil, the convicts, the thrashings, the double chain for nothing, the cell for one word; even sick and in bed, still the chain! Dogs, dogs are happier! Nineteen years! I am forty-six. Now there is the yellow passport. That is what it is like.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù resumed the Bishop, ‚Äúyou have come from a very sad place. Listen. There will be more joy in heaven over the tear-bathed face of a repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men. If you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind, you are deserving of pity; if you emerge with thoughts of good-will and of peace, you are more worthy than any one of us.‚Äù
U||In the meantime, Madame Magloire had served supper: soup, made with water, oil, bread, and salt; a little bacon, a bit of mutton, figs, a fresh cheese, and a large loaf of rye bread. She had, of her own accord, added to the Bishop‚Äôs ordinary fare a bottle of his old Mauves wine.
U||The Bishop‚Äôs face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is peculiar to hospitable natures. ‚ÄúTo table!‚Äù he cried vivaciously. As was his custom when a stranger supped with him, he made the man sit on his right. Mademoiselle Baptistine, perfectly peaceable and natural, took her seat at his left.
U||The Bishop asked a blessing; then helped the soup himself, according to his custom. The man began to eat with avidity.
U||All at once the Bishop said: ‚ÄúIt strikes me there is something missing on this table.‚Äù
U||Madame Magloire had, in fact, only placed the three sets of forks and spoons which were absolutely necessary. Now, it was the usage of the house, when the Bishop had any one to supper, to lay out the whole six sets of silver on the table-cloth‚Äîan innocent ostentation. This graceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child‚Äôs play, which was full of charm in that gentle and severe household, which raised poverty into dignity.
U||Madame Magloire understood the remark, went out without saying a word, and a moment later the three sets of silver forks and spoons demanded by the Bishop were glittering upon the cloth, symmetrically arranged before the three persons seated at the table.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîDETAILS CONCERNING THE CHEESE-DAIRIES OF PONTARLIER.
U||Now, in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table, we cannot do better than to transcribe here a passage from one of Mademoiselle Baptistine‚Äôs letters to Madame Boischevron, wherein the conversation between the convict and the Bishop is described with ingenious minuteness.
U||‚Äú. . . This man paid no attention to any one. He ate with the voracity of a starving man. However, after supper he said:
U||‚Äú‚ÄòMonsieur le Cur√© of the good God, all this is far too good for me; but I must say that the carters who would not allow me to eat with them keep a better table than you do.‚Äô
U||‚ÄúBetween ourselves, the remark rather shocked me. My brother replied:‚Äî
U||‚Äú‚ÄòThey are more fatigued than I.‚Äô
U||‚Äú‚ÄòNo,‚Äô returned the man, ‚Äòthey have more money. You are poor; I see that plainly. You cannot be even a curate. Are you really a cur√©? Ah, if the good God were but just, you certainly ought to be a cur√©!‚Äô
U||‚Äú‚ÄòThe good God is more than just,‚Äô said my brother.
U||‚ÄúA moment later he added:‚Äî
U||‚Äú‚ÄòMonsieur Jean Valjean, is it to Pontarlier that you are going?‚Äô
U||‚Äú‚ÄòWith my road marked out for me.‚Äô
U||‚ÄúI think that is what the man said. Then he went on:‚Äî
U||‚Äú‚ÄòI must be on my way by daybreak to-morrow. Travelling is hard. If the nights are cold, the days are hot.‚Äô
U||‚Äú‚ÄòYou are going to a good country,‚Äô said my brother. ‚ÄòDuring the Revolution my family was ruined. I took refuge in Franche-Comt√© at first, and there I lived for some time by the toil of my hands. My will was good. I found plenty to occupy me. One has only to choose. There are paper mills, tanneries, distilleries, oil factories, watch factories on a large scale, steel mills, copper works, twenty iron foundries at least, four of which, situated at Lods, at Ch√¢tillon, at Audincourt, and at Beure, are tolerably large.‚Äô
U||‚ÄúI think I am not mistaken in saying that those are the names which my brother mentioned. Then he interrupted himself and addressed me:‚Äî
U||‚Äú‚ÄòHave we not some relatives in those parts, my dear sister?‚Äô
U||‚ÄúI replied,‚Äî
U||‚Äú‚ÄòWe did have some; among others, M. de Lucenet, who was captain of the gates at Pontarlier under the old r√©gime.‚Äô
U||‚Äú‚ÄòYes,‚Äô resumed my brother; ‚Äòbut in ‚Äô93, one had no longer any relatives, one had only one‚Äôs arms. I worked. They have, in the country of Pontarlier, whither you are going, Monsieur Valjean, a truly patriarchal and truly charming industry, my sister. It is their cheese-dairies, which they call fruiti√®res.‚Äô
U||‚ÄúThen my brother, while urging the man to eat, explained to him, with great minuteness, what these fruiti√®res of Pontarlier were; that they were divided into two classes: the big barns which belong to the rich, and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven to eight thousand cheeses each summer, and the associated fruiti√®res, which belong to the poor; these are the peasants of mid-mountain, who hold their cows in common, and share the proceeds. ‚ÄòThey engage the services of a cheese-maker, whom they call the grurin; the grurin receives the milk of the associates three times a day, and marks the quantity on a double tally. It is towards the end of April that the work of the cheese-dairies begins; it is towards the middle of June that the cheese-makers drive their cows to the mountains.‚Äô
U||‚ÄúThe man recovered his animation as he ate. My brother made him drink that good Mauves wine, which he does not drink himself, because he says that wine is expensive. My brother imparted all these details with that easy gayety of his with which you are acquainted, interspersing his words with graceful attentions to me. He recurred frequently to that comfortable trade of grurin, as though he wished the man to understand, without advising him directly and harshly, that this would afford him a refuge. One thing struck me. This man was what I have told you. Well, neither during supper, nor during the entire evening, did my brother utter a single word, with the exception of a few words about Jesus when he entered, which could remind the man of what he was, nor of what my brother was. To all appearances, it was an occasion for preaching him a little sermon, and of impressing the Bishop on the convict, so that a mark of the passage might remain behind. This might have appeared to any one else who had this, unfortu
U||nate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well as his body, and to bestow upon him some reproach, seasoned with moralizing and advice, or a little commiseration, with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the future. My brother did not even ask him from what country he came, nor what was his history. For in his history there is a fault, and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it. To such a point did he carry it, that at one time, when my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of Pontarlier, who exercise a gentle labor near heaven, and who, he added, are happy because they are innocent, he stopped short, fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him something which might wound the man. By dint of reflection, I think I have comprehended what was passing in my brother‚Äôs heart. He was thinking, no doubt, that this man, whose name is Jean Valjean, had his misfortune only too vividly present in his mind; that the best thing was to divert him fr
U||om it, and to make him believe, if only momentarily, that he was a person like any other, by treating him just in his ordinary way. Is not this indeed, to understand charity well? Is there not, dear Madame, something truly evangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon, from moralizing, from allusions? and is not the truest pity, when a man has a sore point, not to touch it at all? It has seemed to me that this might have been my brother‚Äôs private thought. In any case, what I can say is that, if he entertained all these ideas, he gave no sign of them; from beginning to end, even to me he was the same as he is every evening, and he supped with this Jean Valjean with the same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with M. G√©d√©on le Pr√©vost, or with the curate of the parish.
U||‚ÄúTowards the end, when he had reached the figs, there came a knock at the door. It was Mother Gerbaud, with her little one in her arms. My brother kissed the child on the brow, and borrowed fifteen sous which I had about me to give to Mother Gerbaud. The man was not paying much heed to anything then. He was no longer talking, and he seemed very much fatigued. After poor old Gerbaud had taken her departure, my brother said grace; then he turned to the man and said to him, ‚ÄòYou must be in great need of your bed.‚Äô Madame Magloire cleared the table very promptly. I understood that we must retire, in order to allow this traveller to go to sleep, and we both went upstairs. Nevertheless, I sent Madame Magloire down a moment later, to carry to the man‚Äôs bed a goat skin from the Black Forest, which was in my room. The nights are frigid, and that keeps one warm. It is a pity that this skin is old; all the hair is falling out. My brother bought it while he was in Germany, at Tottlingen, near the sources of the 
U||Danube, as well as the little ivory-handled knife which I use at table.
U||‚ÄúMadame Magloire returned immediately. We said our prayers in the drawing-room, where we hang up the linen, and then we each retired to our own chambers, without saying a word to each other.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîTRANQUILLITY
U||After bidding his sister good night, Monseigneur Bienvenu took one of the two silver candlesticks from the table, handed the other to his guest, and said to him,‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur, I will conduct you to your room.‚Äù
U||The man followed him.
U||As might have been observed from what has been said above, the house was so arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove was situated, or to get out of it, it was necessary to traverse the Bishop‚Äôs bedroom.
U||At the moment when he was crossing this apartment, Madame Magloire was putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed. This was her last care every evening before she went to bed.
U||The Bishop installed his guest in the alcove. A fresh white bed had been prepared there. The man set the candle down on a small table.
U||‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said the Bishop, ‚Äúmay you pass a good night. To-morrow morning, before you set out, you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThanks, Monsieur l‚ÄôAbb√©,‚Äù said the man.
U||Hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace, when all of a sudden, and without transition, he made a strange movement, which would have frozen the two sainted women with horror, had they witnessed it. Even at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him at that moment. Did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a menace? Was he simply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscure even to himself? He turned abruptly to the old man, folded his arms, and bending upon his host a savage gaze, he exclaimed in a hoarse voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAh! really! You lodge me in your house, close to yourself like this?‚Äù
U||He broke off, and added with a laugh in which there lurked something monstrous:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHave you really reflected well? How do you know that I have not been an assassin?‚Äù
U||The Bishop replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat is the concern of the good God.‚Äù
U||Then gravely, and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking to himself, he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed his benediction on the man, who did not bow, and without turning his head or looking behind him, he returned to his bedroom.
U||When the alcove was in use, a large serge curtain drawn from wall to wall concealed the altar. The Bishop knelt before this curtain as he passed and said a brief prayer. A moment later he was in his garden, walking, meditating, contemplating, his heart and soul wholly absorbed in those grand and mysterious things which God shows at night to the eyes which remain open.
U||As for the man, he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit by the nice white sheets. Snuffing out his candle with his nostrils after the manner of convicts, he dropped, all dressed as he was, upon the bed, where he immediately fell into a profound sleep.
U||Midnight struck as the Bishop returned from his garden to his apartment.
U||A few minutes later all were asleep in the little house.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîJEAN VALJEAN
U||Towards the middle of the night Jean Valjean woke.
U||Jean Valjean came from a poor peasant family of Brie. He had not learned to read in his childhood. When he reached man‚Äôs estate, he became a tree-pruner at Faverolles. His mother was named Jeanne Mathieu; his father was called Jean Valjean or Vlajean, probably a sobriquet, and a contraction of voil√† Jean, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs Jean.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures. On the whole, however, there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about Jean Valjean in appearance, at least. He had lost his father and mother at a very early age. His mother had died of a milk fever, which had not been properly attended to. His father, a tree-pruner, like himself, had been killed by a fall from a tree. All that remained to Jean Valjean was a sister older than himself,‚Äîa widow with seven children, boys and girls. This sister had brought up Jean Valjean, and so long as she had a husband she lodged and fed her young brother.
U||The husband died. The eldest of the seven children was eight years old. The youngest, one.
U||Jean Valjean had just attained his twenty-fifth year. He took the father‚Äôs place, and, in his turn, supported the sister who had brought him up. This was done simply as a duty and even a little churlishly on the part of Jean Valjean. Thus his youth had been spent in rude and ill-paid toil. He had never known a ‚Äúkind woman friend‚Äù in his native parts. He had not had the time to fall in love.
U||He returned at night weary, and ate his broth without uttering a word. His sister, mother Jeanne, often took the best part of his repast from his bowl while he was eating,‚Äîa bit of meat, a slice of bacon, the heart of the cabbage,‚Äîto give to one of her children. As he went on eating, with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup, his long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes, he had the air of perceiving nothing and allowing it. There was at Faverolles, not far from the Valjean thatched cottage, on the other side of the lane, a farmer‚Äôs wife named Marie-Claude; the Valjean children, habitually famished, sometimes went to borrow from Marie-Claude a pint of milk, in their mother‚Äôs name, which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley corner, snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the little girls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks. If their mother had known of this marauding, she would have punished the delinquents severely. Jean Valjean gruffly and 
U||grumblingly paid Marie-Claude for the pint of milk behind their mother‚Äôs back, and the children were not punished.
U||In pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day; then he hired out as a hay-maker, as laborer, as neat-herd on a farm, as a drudge. He did whatever he could. His sister worked also but what could she do with seven little children? It was a sad group enveloped in misery, which was being gradually annihilated. A very hard winter came. Jean had no work. The family had no bread. No bread literally. Seven children!
U||One Sunday evening, Maubert Isabeau, the baker on the Church Square at Faverolles, was preparing to go to bed, when he heard a violent blow on the grated front of his shop. He arrived in time to see an arm passed through a hole made by a blow from a fist, through the grating and the glass. The arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off. Isabeau ran out in haste; the robber fled at the full speed of his legs. Isabeau ran after him and stopped him. The thief had flung away the loaf, but his arm was still bleeding. It was Jean Valjean.
U||This took place in 1795. Jean Valjean was taken before the tribunals of the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at night. He had a gun which he used better than any one else in the world, he was a bit of a poacher, and this injured his case. There exists a legitimate prejudice against poachers. The poacher, like the smuggler, smacks too strongly of the brigand. Nevertheless, we will remark cursorily, there is still an abyss between these races of men and the hideous assassin of the towns. The poacher lives in the forest, the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea. The cities make ferocious men because they make corrupt men. The mountain, the sea, the forest, make savage men; they develop the fierce side, but often without destroying the humane side.
U||Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty. The terms of the Code were explicit. There occur formidable hours in our civilization; there are moments when the penal laws decree a shipwreck. What an ominous minute is that in which society draws back and consummates the irreparable abandonment of a sentient being! Jean Valjean was condemned to five years in the galleys.
U||On the 22d of April, 1796, the victory of Montenotte, won by the general-in-chief of the army of Italy, whom the message of the Directory to the Five Hundred, of the 2d of Flor√©al, year IV., calls Buona-Parte, was announced in Paris; on that same day a great gang of galley-slaves was put in chains at Bic√™tre. Jean Valjean formed a part of that gang. An old turnkey of the prison, who is now nearly eighty years old, still recalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of the fourth line, in the north angle of the courtyard. He was seated on the ground like the others. He did not seem to comprehend his position, except that it was horrible. It is probable that he, also, was disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor man, ignorant of everything, something excessive. While the bolt of his iron collar was being riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer, he wept, his tears stifled him, they impeded his speech; he only managed to say from time to time, ‚ÄúI was a tree-pr
U||uner at Faverolles.‚Äù Then still sobbing, he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times, as though he were touching in succession seven heads of unequal heights, and from this gesture it was divined that the thing which he had done, whatever it was, he had done for the sake of clothing and nourishing seven little children.
U||He set out for Toulon. He arrived there, after a journey of twenty-seven days, on a cart, with a chain on his neck. At Toulon he was clothed in the red cassock. All that had constituted his life, even to his name, was effaced; he was no longer even Jean Valjean; he was number 24,601. What became of his sister? What became of the seven children? Who troubled himself about that? What becomes of the handful of leaves from the young tree which is sawed off at the root?
U||It is always the same story. These poor living beings, these creatures of God, henceforth without support, without guide, without refuge, wandered away at random,‚Äîwho even knows?‚Äîeach in his own direction perhaps, and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which engulfs solitary destinies; gloomy shades, into which disappear in succession so many unlucky heads, in the sombre march of the human race. They quitted the country. The clock-tower of what had been their village forgot them; the boundary line of what had been their field forgot them; after a few years‚Äô residence in the galleys, Jean Valjean himself forgot them. In that heart, where there had been a wound, there was a scar. That is all. Only once, during all the time which he spent at Toulon, did he hear his sister mentioned. This happened, I think, towards the end of the fourth year of his captivity. I know not through what channels the news reached him. Some one who had known them in their own country had seen his sister. She wa
U||s in Paris. She lived in a poor street near Saint-Sulpice, in the Rue du Gindre. She had with her only one child, a little boy, the youngest. Where were the other six? Perhaps she did not know herself. Every morning she went to a printing office, No. 3 Rue du Sabot, where she was a folder and stitcher. She was obliged to be there at six o‚Äôclock in the morning‚Äîlong before daylight in winter. In the same building with the printing office there was a school, and to this school she took her little boy, who was seven years old. But as she entered the printing office at six, and the school only opened at seven, the child had to wait in the courtyard, for the school to open, for an hour‚Äîone hour of a winter night in the open air! They would not allow the child to come into the printing office, because he was in the way, they said. When the workmen passed in the morning, they beheld this poor little being seated on the pavement, overcome with drowsiness, and often fast asleep in the shadow, crouched down and d
U||oubled up over his basket. When it rained, an old woman, the portress, took pity on him; she took him into her den, where there was a pallet, a spinning-wheel, and two wooden chairs, and the little one slumbered in a corner, pressing himself close to the cat that he might suffer less from cold. At seven o‚Äôclock the school opened, and he entered. That is what was told to Jean Valjean.
U||They talked to him about it for one day; it was a moment, a flash, as though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those things whom he had loved; then all closed again. He heard nothing more forever. Nothing from them ever reached him again; he never beheld them; he never met them again; and in the continuation of this mournful history they will not be met with any more.
U||Towards the end of this fourth year Jean Valjean‚Äôs turn to escape arrived. His comrades assisted him, as is the custom in that sad place. He escaped. He wandered for two days in the fields at liberty, if being at liberty is to be hunted, to turn the head every instant, to quake at the slightest noise, to be afraid of everything,‚Äîof a smoking roof, of a passing man, of a barking dog, of a galloping horse, of a striking clock, of the day because one can see, of the night because one cannot see, of the highway, of the path, of a bush, of sleep. On the evening of the second day he was captured. He had neither eaten nor slept for thirty-six hours. The maritime tribunal condemned him, for this crime, to a prolongation of his term for three years, which made eight years. In the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again; he availed himself of it, but could not accomplish his flight fully. He was missing at roll-call. The cannon were fired, and at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vessel in
U|| process of construction; he resisted the galley guards who seized him. Escape and rebellion. This case, provided for by a special code, was punished by an addition of five years, two of them in the double chain. Thirteen years. In the tenth year his turn came round again; he again profited by it; he succeeded no better. Three years for this fresh attempt. Sixteen years. Finally, I think it was during his thirteenth year, he made a last attempt, and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of four hours of absence. Three years for those four hours. Nineteen years. In October, 1815, he was released; he had entered there in 1796, for having broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread.
U||Room for a brief parenthesis. This is the second time, during his studies on the penal question and damnation by law, that the author of this book has come across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of departure for the disaster of a destiny. Claude Gaux had stolen a loaf; Jean Valjean had stolen a loaf. English statistics prove the fact that four thefts out of five in London have hunger for their immediate cause.
U||Jean Valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering; he emerged impassive. He had entered in despair; he emerged gloomy.
U||What had taken place in that soul?
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîTHE INTERIOR OF DESPAIR
U||Let us try to say it.
U||It is necessary that society should look at these things, because it is itself which creates them.
U||He was, as we have said, an ignorant man, but he was not a fool. The light of nature was ignited in him. Unhappiness, which also possesses a clearness of vision of its own, augmented the small amount of daylight which existed in this mind. Beneath the cudgel, beneath the chain, in the cell, in hardship, beneath the burning sun of the galleys, upon the plank bed of the convict, he withdrew into his own consciousness and meditated.
U||He constituted himself the tribunal.
U||He began by putting himself on trial.
U||He recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly punished. He admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy act; that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused to him had he asked for it; that, in any case, it would have been better to wait until he could get it through compassion or through work; that it is not an unanswerable argument to say, ‚ÄúCan one wait when one is hungry?‚Äù That, in the first place, it is very rare for any one to die of hunger, literally; and next, that, fortunately or unfortunately, man is so constituted that he can suffer long and much, both morally and physically, without dying; that it is therefore necessary to have patience; that that would even have been better for those poor little children; that it had been an act of madness for him, a miserable, unfortunate wretch, to take society at large violently by the collar, and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft; that that is in any case a poor door through which to escap
U||e from misery through which infamy enters; in short, that he was in the wrong.
U||Then he asked himself:‚Äî
U||Whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history. Whether it was not a serious thing, that he, a laborer, out of work, that he, an industrious man, should have lacked bread. And whether, the fault once committed and confessed, the chastisement had not been ferocious and disproportioned. Whether there had not been more abuse on the part of the law, in respect to the penalty, than there had been on the part of the culprit in respect to his fault. Whether there had not been an excess of weights in one balance of the scale, in the one which contains expiation. Whether the over-weight of the penalty was not equivalent to the annihilation of the crime, and did not result in reversing the situation, of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of the repression, of converting the guilty man into the victim, and the debtor into the creditor, and of ranging the law definitely on the side of the man who had violated it.
U||Whether this penalty, complicated by successive aggravations for attempts at escape, had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage perpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler, a crime of society against the individual, a crime which was being committed afresh every day, a crime which had lasted nineteen years.
U||He asked himself whether human society could have the right to force its members to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lack of foresight, and in the other case for its pitiless foresight; and to seize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess, a default of work and an excess of punishment.
U||Whether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely those of its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods made by chance, and consequently the most deserving of consideration.
U||These questions put and answered, he judged society and condemned it.
U||He condemned it to his hatred.
U||He made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering, and he said to himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to call it to account. He declared to himself that there was no equilibrium between the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done to him; he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was not, in truth, unjust, but that it most assuredly was iniquitous.
U||Anger may be both foolish and absurd; one can be irritated wrongfully; one is exasperated only when there is some show of right on one‚Äôs side at bottom. Jean Valjean felt himself exasperated.
U||And besides, human society had done him nothing but harm; he had never seen anything of it save that angry face which it calls Justice, and which it shows to those whom it strikes. Men had only touched him to bruise him. Every contact with them had been a blow. Never, since his infancy, since the days of his mother, of his sister, had he ever encountered a friendly word and a kindly glance. From suffering to suffering, he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is a war; and that in this war he was the conquered. He had no other weapon than his hate. He resolved to whet it in the galleys and to bear it away with him when he departed.
U||There was at Toulon a school for the convicts, kept by the Ignorantin friars, where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the unfortunate men who had a mind for them. He was of the number who had a mind. He went to school at the age of forty, and learned to read, to write, to cipher. He felt that to fortify his intelligence was to fortify his hate. In certain cases, education and enlightenment can serve to eke out evil.
U||This is a sad thing to say; after having judged society, which had caused his unhappiness, he judged Providence, which had made society, and he condemned it also.
U||Thus during nineteen years of torture and slavery, this soul mounted and at the same time fell. Light entered it on one side, and darkness on the other.
U||Jean Valjean had not, as we have seen, an evil nature. He was still good when he arrived at the galleys. He there condemned society, and felt that he was becoming wicked; he there condemned Providence, and was conscious that he was becoming impious.
U||It is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point.
U||Does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom? Can the man created good by God be rendered wicked by man? Can the soul be completely made over by fate, and become evil, fate being evil? Can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness, as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault? Is there not in every human soul, was there not in the soul of Jean Valjean in particular, a first spark, a divine element, incorruptible in this world, immortal in the other, which good can develop, fan, ignite, and make to glow with splendor, and which evil can never wholly extinguish?
U||Grave and obscure questions, to the last of which every physiologist would probably have responded no, and that without hesitation, had he beheld at Toulon, during the hours of repose, which were for Jean Valjean hours of reverie, this gloomy galley-slave, seated with folded arms upon the bar of some capstan, with the end of his chain thrust into his pocket to prevent its dragging, serious, silent, and thoughtful, a pariah of the laws which regarded the man with wrath, condemned by civilization, and regarding heaven with severity.
U||Certainly,‚Äîand we make no attempt to dissimulate the fact,‚Äîthe observing physiologist would have beheld an irremediable misery; he would, perchance, have pitied this sick man, of the law‚Äôs making; but he would not have even essayed any treatment; he would have turned aside his gaze from the caverns of which he would have caught a glimpse within this soul, and, like Dante at the portals of hell, he would have effaced from this existence the word which the finger of God has, nevertheless, inscribed upon the brow of every man,‚Äîhope.
U||Was this state of his soul, which we have attempted to analyze, as perfectly clear to Jean Valjean as we have tried to render it for those who read us? Did Jean Valjean distinctly perceive, after their formation, and had he seen distinctly during the process of their formation, all the elements of which his moral misery was composed? Had this rough and unlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception of the succession of ideas through which he had, by degrees, mounted and descended to the lugubrious aspects which had, for so many years, formed the inner horizon of his spirit? Was he conscious of all that passed within him, and of all that was working there? That is something which we do not presume to state; it is something which we do not even believe. There was too much ignorance in Jean Valjean, even after his misfortune, to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there. At times he did not rightly know himself what he felt. Jean Valjean was in the shadows; he suffered in the shadows; he hated in 
U||the shadows; one might have said that he hated in advance of himself. He dwelt habitually in this shadow, feeling his way like a blind man and a dreamer. Only, at intervals, there suddenly came to him, from without and from within, an access of wrath, a surcharge of suffering, a livid and rapid flash which illuminated his whole soul, and caused to appear abruptly all around him, in front, behind, amid the gleams of a frightful light, the hideous precipices and the sombre perspective of his destiny.
U||The flash passed, the night closed in again; and where was he? He no longer knew. The peculiarity of pains of this nature, in which that which is pitiless‚Äîthat is to say, that which is brutalizing‚Äîpredominates, is to transform a man, little by little, by a sort of stupid transfiguration, into a wild beast; sometimes into a ferocious beast.
U||Jean Valjean‚Äôs successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alone suffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul. Jean Valjean would have renewed these attempts, utterly useless and foolish as they were, as often as the opportunity had presented itself, without reflecting for an instant on the result, nor on the experiences which he had already gone through. He escaped impetuously, like the wolf who finds his cage open. Instinct said to him, ‚ÄúFlee!‚Äù Reason would have said, ‚ÄúRemain!‚Äù But in the presence of so violent a temptation, reason vanished; nothing remained but instinct. The beast alone acted. When he was recaptured, the fresh severities inflicted on him only served to render him still more wild.
U||One detail, which we must not omit, is that he possessed a physical strength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of the galleys. At work, at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan, Jean Valjean was worth four men. He sometimes lifted and sustained enormous weights on his back; and when the occasion demanded it, he replaced that implement which is called a jack-screw, and was formerly called orgueil [pride], whence, we may remark in passing, is derived the name of the Rue Montorgueil, near the Halles [Fishmarket] in Paris. His comrades had nicknamed him Jean the Jack-screw. Once, when they were repairing the balcony of the town-hall at Toulon, one of those admirable caryatids of Puget, which support the balcony, became loosened, and was on the point of falling. Jean Valjean, who was present, supported the caryatid with his shoulder, and gave the workmen time to arrive.
U||His suppleness even exceeded his strength. Certain convicts who were forever dreaming of escape, ended by making a veritable science of force and skill combined. It is the science of muscles. An entire system of mysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners, men who are forever envious of the flies and birds. To climb a vertical surface, and to find points of support where hardly a projection was visible, was play to Jean Valjean. An angle of the wall being given, with the tension of his back and legs, with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness of the stone, he raised himself as if by magic to the third story. He sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison.
U||He spoke but little. He laughed not at all. An excessive emotion was required to wring from him, once or twice a year, that lugubrious laugh of the convict, which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon. To all appearance, he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of something terrible.
U||He was absorbed, in fact.
U||Athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed intelligence, he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing was resting on him. In that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled, each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance, he perceived with terror, mingled with rage, a sort of frightful accumulation of things, collecting and mounting above him, beyond the range of his vision,‚Äîlaws, prejudices, men, and deeds,‚Äîwhose outlines escaped him, whose mass terrified him, and which was nothing else than that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization. He distinguished, here and there in that swarming and formless mass, now near him, now afar off and on inaccessible table-lands, some group, some detail, vividly illuminated; here the galley-sergeant and his cudgel; there the gendarme and his sword; yonder the mitred archbishop; away at the top, like a sort of sun, the Emperor, crowned and dazzling. It seemed to him that these distant splendors, far from 
U||dissipating his night, rendered it more funereal and more black. All this‚Äîlaws, prejudices, deeds, men, things‚Äîwent and came above him, over his head, in accordance with the complicated and mysterious movement which God imparts to civilization, walking over him and crushing him with I know not what peacefulness in its cruelty and inexorability in its indifference. Souls which have fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune, unhappy men lost in the lowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks, the reproved of the law, feel the whole weight of this human society, so formidable for him who is without, so frightful for him who is beneath, resting upon their heads.
U||In this situation Jean Valjean meditated; and what could be the nature of his meditation?
U||If the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts, it would, doubtless, think that same thing which Jean Valjean thought.
U||All these things, realities full of spectres, phantasmagories full of realities, had eventually created for him a sort of interior state which is almost indescribable.
U||At times, amid his convict toil, he paused. He fell to thinking. His reason, at one and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore, rose in revolt. Everything which had happened to him seemed to him absurd; everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible. He said to himself, ‚ÄúIt is a dream.‚Äù He gazed at the galley-sergeant standing a few paces from him; the galley-sergeant seemed a phantom to him. All of a sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel.
U||Visible nature hardly existed for him. It would almost be true to say that there existed for Jean Valjean neither sun, nor fine summer days, nor radiant sky, nor fresh April dawns. I know not what vent-hole daylight habitually illumined his soul.
U||To sum up, in conclusion, that which can be summed up and translated into positive results in all that we have just pointed out, we will confine ourselves to the statement that, in the course of nineteen years, Jean Valjean, the inoffensive tree-pruner of Faverolles, the formidable convict of Toulon, had become capable, thanks to the manner in which the galleys had moulded him, of two sorts of evil action: firstly, of evil action which was rapid, unpremeditated, dashing, entirely instinctive, in the nature of reprisals for the evil which he had undergone; secondly, of evil action which was serious, grave, consciously argued out and premeditated, with the false ideas which such a misfortune can furnish. His deliberate deeds passed through three successive phases, which natures of a certain stamp can alone traverse,‚Äîreasoning, will, perseverance. He had for moving causes his habitual wrath, bitterness of soul, a profound sense of indignities suffered, the reaction even against the good, the innocent, and the
U|| just, if there are any such. The point of departure, like the point of arrival, for all his thoughts, was hatred of human law; that hatred which, if it be not arrested in its development by some providential incident, becomes, within a given time, the hatred of society, then the hatred of the human race, then the hatred of creation, and which manifests itself by a vague, incessant, and brutal desire to do harm to some living being, no matter whom. It will be perceived that it was not without reason that Jean Valjean‚Äôs passport described him as a very dangerous man.
U||From year to year this soul had dried away slowly, but with fatal sureness. When the heart is dry, the eye is dry. On his departure from the galleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear.
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîBILLOWS AND SHADOWS
U||A man overboard!
U||What matters it? The vessel does not halt. The wind blows. That sombre ship has a path which it is forced to pursue. It passes on.
U||The man disappears, then reappears; he plunges, he rises again to the surface; he calls, he stretches out his arms; he is not heard. The vessel, trembling under the hurricane, is wholly absorbed in its own workings; the passengers and sailors do not even see the drowning man; his miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of the waves. He gives vent to desperate cries from out of the depths. What a spectre is that retreating sail! He gazes and gazes at it frantically. It retreats, it grows dim, it diminishes in size. He was there but just now, he was one of the crew, he went and came along the deck with the rest, he had his part of breath and of sunlight, he was a living man. Now, what has taken place? He has slipped, he has fallen; all is at an end.
U||He is in the tremendous sea. Under foot he has nothing but what flees and crumbles. The billows, torn and lashed by the wind, encompass him hideously; the tossings of the abyss bear him away; all the tongues of water dash over his head; a populace of waves spits upon him; confused openings half devour him; every time that he sinks, he catches glimpses of precipices filled with night; frightful and unknown vegetations seize him, knot about his feet, draw him to them; he is conscious that he is becoming an abyss, that he forms part of the foam; the waves toss him from one to another; he drinks in the bitterness; the cowardly ocean attacks him furiously, to drown him; the enormity plays with his agony. It seems as though all that water were hate.
U||Nevertheless, he struggles.
U||He tries to defend himself; he tries to sustain himself; he makes an effort; he swims. He, his petty strength all exhausted instantly, combats the inexhaustible.
U||Where, then, is the ship? Yonder. Barely visible in the pale shadows of the horizon.
U||The wind blows in gusts; all the foam overwhelms him. He raises his eyes and beholds only the lividness of the clouds. He witnesses, amid his death-pangs, the immense madness of the sea. He is tortured by this madness; he hears noises strange to man, which seem to come from beyond the limits of the earth, and from one knows not what frightful region beyond.
U||There are birds in the clouds, just as there are angels above human distresses; but what can they do for him? They sing and fly and float, and he, he rattles in the death agony.
U||He feels himself buried in those two infinities, the ocean and the sky, at one and the same time: the one is a tomb; the other is a shroud.
U||Night descends; he has been swimming for hours; his strength is exhausted; that ship, that distant thing in which there were men, has vanished; he is alone in the formidable twilight gulf; he sinks, he stiffens himself, he twists himself; he feels under him the monstrous billows of the invisible; he shouts.
U||There are no more men. Where is God?
U||He shouts. Help! Help! He still shouts on.
U||Nothing on the horizon; nothing in heaven.
U||He implores the expanse, the waves, the seaweed, the reef; they are deaf. He beseeches the tempest; the imperturbable tempest obeys only the infinite.
U||Around him darkness, fog, solitude, the stormy and nonsentient tumult, the undefined curling of those wild waters. In him horror and fatigue. Beneath him the depths. Not a point of support. He thinks of the gloomy adventures of the corpse in the limitless shadow. The bottomless cold paralyzes him. His hands contract convulsively; they close, and grasp nothingness. Winds, clouds, whirlwinds, gusts, useless stars! What is to be done? The desperate man gives up; he is weary, he chooses the alternative of death; he resists not; he lets himself go; he abandons his grip; and then he tosses forevermore in the lugubrious dreary depths of engulfment.
U||Oh, implacable march of human societies! Oh, losses of men and of souls on the way! Ocean into which falls all that the law lets slip! Disastrous absence of help! Oh, moral death!
U||The sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws fling their condemned. The sea is the immensity of wretchedness.
U||The soul, going downstream in this gulf, may become a corpse. Who shall resuscitate it?
U||CHAPTER IX‚ÄîNEW TROUBLES
U||When the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys, when Jean Valjean heard in his ear the strange words, Thou art free! the moment seemed improbable and unprecedented; a ray of vivid light, a ray of the true light of the living, suddenly penetrated within him. But it was not long before this ray paled. Jean Valjean had been dazzled by the idea of liberty. He had believed in a new life. He very speedily perceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is provided.
U||And this was encompassed with much bitterness. He had calculated that his earnings, during his sojourn in the galleys, ought to amount to a hundred and seventy-one francs. It is but just to add that he had forgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of Sundays and festival days during nineteen years, which entailed a diminution of about eighty francs. At all events, his hoard had been reduced by various local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous, which had been counted out to him on his departure. He had understood nothing of this, and had thought himself wronged. Let us say the word‚Äîrobbed.
U||On the day following his liberation, he saw, at Grasse, in front of an orange-flower distillery, some men engaged in unloading bales. He offered his services. Business was pressing; they were accepted. He set to work. He was intelligent, robust, adroit; he did his best; the master seemed pleased. While he was at work, a gendarme passed, observed him, and demanded his papers. It was necessary to show him the yellow passport. That done, Jean Valjean resumed his labor. A little while before he had questioned one of the workmen as to the amount which they earned each day at this occupation; he had been told thirty sous. When evening arrived, as he was forced to set out again on the following day, he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be paid. The owner did not utter a word, but handed him fifteen sous. He objected. He was told, ‚ÄúThat is enough for thee.‚Äù He persisted. The master looked him straight between the eyes, and said to him ‚ÄúBeware of the prison.‚Äù
U||There, again, he considered that he had been robbed.
U||Society, the State, by diminishing his hoard, had robbed him wholesale. Now it was the individual who was robbing him at retail.
U||Liberation is not deliverance. One gets free from the galleys, but not from the sentence.
U||That is what happened to him at Grasse. We have seen in what manner he was received at D‚Äî‚Äî
U||CHAPTER X‚ÄîTHE MAN AROUSED
U||As the Cathedral clock struck two in the morning, Jean Valjean awoke.
U||What woke him was that his bed was too good. It was nearly twenty years since he had slept in a bed, and, although he had not undressed, the sensation was too novel not to disturb his slumbers.
U||He had slept more than four hours. His fatigue had passed away. He was accustomed not to devote many hours to repose.
U||He opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him; then he closed them again, with the intention of going to sleep once more.
U||When many varied sensations have agitated the day, when various matters preoccupy the mind, one falls asleep once, but not a second time. Sleep comes more easily than it returns. This is what happened to Jean Valjean. He could not get to sleep again, and he fell to thinking.
U||He was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one‚Äôs mind are troubled. There was a sort of dark confusion in his brain. His memories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there pell-mell and mingled confusedly, losing their proper forms, becoming disproportionately large, then suddenly disappearing, as in a muddy and perturbed pool. Many thoughts occurred to him; but there was one which kept constantly presenting itself afresh, and which drove away all others. We will mention this thought at once: he had observed the six sets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle which Madame Magloire had placed on the table.
U||Those six sets of silver haunted him.‚ÄîThey were there.‚ÄîA few paces distant.‚ÄîJust as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the one in which he then was, the old servant-woman had been in the act of placing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed.‚ÄîHe had taken careful note of this cupboard.‚ÄîOn the right, as you entered from the dining-room.‚ÄîThey were solid.‚ÄîAnd old silver.‚ÄîFrom the ladle one could get at least two hundred francs.‚ÄîDouble what he had earned in nineteen years.‚ÄîIt is true that he would have earned more if ‚Äúthe administration had not robbed him.‚Äù
U||His mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there was certainly mingled some struggle. Three o‚Äôclock struck. He opened his eyes again, drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture, stretched out his arm and felt of his knapsack, which he had thrown down on a corner of the alcove; then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed, and placed his feet on the floor, and thus found himself, almost without knowing it, seated on his bed.
U||He remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude, which would have been suggestive of something sinister for any one who had seen him thus in the dark, the only person awake in that house where all were sleeping. All of a sudden he stooped down, removed his shoes and placed them softly on the mat beside the bed; then he resumed his thoughtful attitude, and became motionless once more.
U||Throughout this hideous meditation, the thoughts which we have above indicated moved incessantly through his brain; entered, withdrew, re-entered, and in a manner oppressed him; and then he thought, also, without knowing why, and with the mechanical persistence of reverie, of a convict named Brevet, whom he had known in the galleys, and whose trousers had been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton. The checkered pattern of that suspender recurred incessantly to his mind.
U||He remained in this situation, and would have so remained indefinitely, even until daybreak, had not the clock struck one‚Äîthe half or quarter hour. It seemed to him that that stroke said to him, ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù
U||He rose to his feet, hesitated still another moment, and listened; all was quiet in the house; then he walked straight ahead, with short steps, to the window, of which he caught a glimpse. The night was not very dark; there was a full moon, across which coursed large clouds driven by the wind. This created, outdoors, alternate shadow and gleams of light, eclipses, then bright openings of the clouds; and indoors a sort of twilight. This twilight, sufficient to enable a person to see his way, intermittent on account of the clouds, resembled the sort of livid light which falls through an air-hole in a cellar, before which the passers-by come and go. On arriving at the window, Jean Valjean examined it. It had no grating; it opened in the garden and was fastened, according to the fashion of the country, only by a small pin. He opened it; but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly, he closed it again immediately. He scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than 
U||looks. The garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall, easy to climb. Far away, at the extremity, he perceived tops of trees, spaced at regular intervals, which indicated that the wall separated the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees.
U||Having taken this survey, he executed a movement like that of a man who has made up his mind, strode to his alcove, grasped his knapsack, opened it, fumbled in it, pulled out of it something which he placed on the bed, put his shoes into one of his pockets, shut the whole thing up again, threw the knapsack on his shoulders, put on his cap, drew the visor down over his eyes, felt for his cudgel, went and placed it in the angle of the window; then returned to the bed, and resolutely seized the object which he had deposited there. It resembled a short bar of iron, pointed like a pike at one end. It would have been difficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit of iron could have been designed. Perhaps it was a lever; possibly it was a club.
U||In the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing more than a miner‚Äôs candlestick. Convicts were, at that period, sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which environ Toulon, and it was not rare for them to have miners‚Äô tools at their command. These miners‚Äô candlesticks are of massive iron, terminated at the lower extremity by a point, by means of which they are stuck into the rock.
U||He took the candlestick in his right hand; holding his breath and trying to deaden the sound of his tread, he directed his steps to the door of the adjoining room, occupied by the Bishop, as we already know.
U||On arriving at this door, he found it ajar. The Bishop had not closed it.
U||CHAPTER XI‚ÄîWHAT HE DOES
U||Jean Valjean listened. Not a sound.
U||He gave the door a push.
U||He pushed it gently with the tip of his finger, lightly, with the furtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering.
U||The door yielded to this pressure, and made an imperceptible and silent movement, which enlarged the opening a little.
U||He waited a moment; then gave the door a second and a bolder push.
U||It continued to yield in silence. The opening was now large enough to allow him to pass. But near the door there stood a little table, which formed an embarrassing angle with it, and barred the entrance.
U||Jean Valjean recognized the difficulty. It was necessary, at any cost, to enlarge the aperture still further.
U||He decided on his course of action, and gave the door a third push, more energetic than the two preceding. This time a badly oiled hinge suddenly emitted amid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry.
U||Jean Valjean shuddered. The noise of the hinge rang in his ears with something of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the Day of Judgment.
U||In the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined that that hinge had just become animated, and had suddenly assumed a terrible life, and that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one, and warn and to wake those who were asleep. He halted, shuddering, bewildered, and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels. He heard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers, and it seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar of the wind issuing from a cavern. It seemed impossible to him that the horrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed the entire household, like the shock of an earthquake; the door, pushed by him, had taken the alarm, and had shouted; the old man would rise at once; the two old women would shriek out; people would come to their assistance; in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an uproar, and the gendarmerie on hand. For a moment he thought himself lost.
U||He remained where he was, petrified like the statue of salt, not daring to make a movement. Several minutes elapsed. The door had fallen wide open. He ventured to peep into the next room. Nothing had stirred there. He lent an ear. Nothing was moving in the house. The noise made by the rusty hinge had not awakened any one.
U||This first danger was past; but there still reigned a frightful tumult within him. Nevertheless, he did not retreat. Even when he had thought himself lost, he had not drawn back. His only thought now was to finish as soon as possible. He took a step and entered the room.
U||This room was in a state of perfect calm. Here and there vague and confused forms were distinguishable, which in the daylight were papers scattered on a table, open folios, volumes piled upon a stool, an armchair heaped with clothing, a prie-Dieu, and which at that hour were only shadowy corners and whitish spots. Jean Valjean advanced with precaution, taking care not to knock against the furniture. He could hear, at the extremity of the room, the even and tranquil breathing of the sleeping Bishop.
U||He suddenly came to a halt. He was near the bed. He had arrived there sooner than he had thought for.
U||Nature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with our actions with sombre and intelligent appropriateness, as though she desired to make us reflect. For the last half-hour a large cloud had covered the heavens. At the moment when Jean Valjean paused in front of the bed, this cloud parted, as though on purpose, and a ray of light, traversing the long window, suddenly illuminated the Bishop‚Äôs pale face. He was sleeping peacefully. He lay in his bed almost completely dressed, on account of the cold of the Basses-Alps, in a garment of brown wool, which covered his arms to the wrists. His head was thrown back on the pillow, in the careless attitude of repose; his hand, adorned with the pastoral ring, and whence had fallen so many good deeds and so many holy actions, was hanging over the edge of the bed. His whole face was illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction, of hope, and of felicity. It was more than a smile, and almost a radiance. He bore upon his brow the indescribable reflection of a
U|| light which was invisible. The soul of the just contemplates in sleep a mysterious heaven.
U||A reflection of that heaven rested on the Bishop.
U||It was, at the same time, a luminous transparency, for that heaven was within him. That heaven was his conscience.
U||The Fall
U||At the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself, so to speak, upon that inward radiance, the sleeping Bishop seemed as in a glory. It remained, however, gentle and veiled in an ineffable half-light. That moon in the sky, that slumbering nature, that garden without a quiver, that house which was so calm, the hour, the moment, the silence, added some solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man, and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white hair, those closed eyes, that face in which all was hope and all was confidence, that head of an old man, and that slumber of an infant.
U||There was something almost divine in this man, who was thus august, without being himself aware of it.
U||Jean Valjean was in the shadow, and stood motionless, with his iron candlestick in his hand, frightened by this luminous old man. Never had he beheld anything like this. This confidence terrified him. The moral world has no grander spectacle than this: a troubled and uneasy conscience, which has arrived on the brink of an evil action, contemplating the slumber of the just.
U||That slumber in that isolation, and with a neighbor like himself, had about it something sublime, of which he was vaguely but imperiously conscious.
U||No one could have told what was passing within him, not even himself. In order to attempt to form an idea of it, it is necessary to think of the most violent of things in the presence of the most gentle. Even on his visage it would have been impossible to distinguish anything with certainty. It was a sort of haggard astonishment. He gazed at it, and that was all. But what was his thought? It would have been impossible to divine it. What was evident was, that he was touched and astounded. But what was the nature of this emotion?
U||His eye never quitted the old man. The only thing which was clearly to be inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange indecision. One would have said that he was hesitating between the two abysses,‚Äîthe one in which one loses one‚Äôs self and that in which one saves one‚Äôs self. He seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss that hand.
U||At the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards his brow, and he took off his cap; then his arm fell back with the same deliberation, and Jean Valjean fell to meditating once more, his cap in his left hand, his club in his right hand, his hair bristling all over his savage head.
U||The Bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying gaze.
U||The gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over the chimney-piece, which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them, with a benediction for one and pardon for the other.
U||Suddenly Jean Valjean replaced his cap on his brow; then stepped rapidly past the bed, without glancing at the Bishop, straight to the cupboard, which he saw near the head; he raised his iron candlestick as though to force the lock; the key was there; he opened it; the first thing which presented itself to him was the basket of silverware; he seized it, traversed the chamber with long strides, without taking any precautions and without troubling himself about the noise, gained the door, re-entered the oratory, opened the window, seized his cudgel, bestrode the window-sill of the ground floor, put the silver into his knapsack, threw away the basket, crossed the garden, leaped over the wall like a tiger, and fled.
U||CHAPTER XII‚ÄîTHE BISHOP WORKS
U||The next morning at sunrise Monseigneur Bienvenu was strolling in his garden. Madame Magloire ran up to him in utter consternation.
U||‚ÄúMonseigneur, Monseigneur!‚Äù she exclaimed, ‚Äúdoes your Grace know where the basket of silver is?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied the Bishop.
U||‚ÄúJesus the Lord be blessed!‚Äù she resumed; ‚ÄúI did not know what had become of it.‚Äù
U||The Bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower-bed. He presented it to Madame Magloire.
U||‚ÄúHere it is.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell!‚Äù said she. ‚ÄúNothing in it! And the silver?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh,‚Äù returned the Bishop, ‚Äúso it is the silver which troubles you? I don‚Äôt know where it is.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGreat, good God! It is stolen! That man who was here last night has stolen it.‚Äù
U||In a twinkling, with all the vivacity of an alert old woman, Madame Magloire had rushed to the oratory, entered the alcove, and returned to the Bishop. The Bishop had just bent down, and was sighing as he examined a plant of cochlearia des Guillons, which the basket had broken as it fell across the bed. He rose up at Madame Magloire‚Äôs cry.
U||‚ÄúMonseigneur, the man is gone! The silver has been stolen!‚Äù
U||As she uttered this exclamation, her eyes fell upon a corner of the garden, where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible. The coping of the wall had been torn away.
U||‚ÄúStay! yonder is the way he went. He jumped over into Cochefilet Lane. Ah, the abomination! He has stolen our silver!‚Äù
U||The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he raised his grave eyes, and said gently to Madame Magloire:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd, in the first place, was that silver ours?‚Äù
U||Madame Magloire was speechless. Another silence ensued; then the Bishop went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMadame Magloire, I have for a long time detained that silver wrongfully. It belonged to the poor. Who was that man? A poor man, evidently.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAlas! Jesus!‚Äù returned Madame Magloire. ‚ÄúIt is not for my sake, nor for Mademoiselle‚Äôs. It makes no difference to us. But it is for the sake of Monseigneur. What is Monseigneur to eat with now?‚Äù
U||The Bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement.
U||‚ÄúAh, come! Are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons?‚Äù
U||Madame Magloire shrugged her shoulders.
U||‚ÄúPewter has an odor.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIron forks and spoons, then.‚Äù
U||Madame Magloire made an expressive grimace.
U||‚ÄúIron has a taste.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù said the Bishop; ‚Äúwooden ones then.‚Äù
U||A few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which Jean Valjean had sat on the previous evening. As he ate his breakfast, Monseigneur Welcome remarked gayly to his sister, who said nothing, and to Madame Magloire, who was grumbling under her breath, that one really does not need either fork or spoon, even of wood, in order to dip a bit of bread in a cup of milk.
U||‚ÄúA pretty idea, truly,‚Äù said Madame Magloire to herself, as she went and came, ‚Äúto take in a man like that! and to lodge him close to one‚Äôs self! And how fortunate that he did nothing but steal! Ah, mon Dieu! it makes one shudder to think of it!‚Äù
U||As the brother and sister were about to rise from the table, there came a knock at the door.
U||‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù said the Bishop.
U||The door opened. A singular and violent group made its appearance on the threshold. Three men were holding a fourth man by the collar. The three men were gendarmes; the other was Jean Valjean.
U||A brigadier of gendarmes, who seemed to be in command of the group, was standing near the door. He entered and advanced to the Bishop, making a military salute.
U||‚ÄúMonseigneur‚Äî‚Äù said he.
U||At this word, Jean Valjean, who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed, raised his head with an air of stupefaction.
U||‚ÄúMonseigneur!‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúSo he is not the cur√©?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSilence!‚Äù said the gendarme. ‚ÄúHe is Monseigneur the Bishop.‚Äù
U||In the meantime, Monseigneur Bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his great age permitted.
U||‚ÄúAh! here you are!‚Äù he exclaimed, looking at Jean Valjean. ‚ÄúI am glad to see you. Well, but how is this? I gave you the candlesticks too, which are of silver like the rest, and for which you can certainly get two hundred francs. Why did you not carry them away with your forks and spoons?‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean opened his eyes wide, and stared at the venerable Bishop with an expression which no human tongue can render any account of.
U||‚ÄúMonseigneur,‚Äù said the brigadier of gendarmes, ‚Äúso what this man said is true, then? We came across him. He was walking like a man who is running away. We stopped him to look into the matter. He had this silver‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd he told you,‚Äù interposed the Bishop with a smile, ‚Äúthat it had been given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed the night? I see how the matter stands. And you have brought him back here? It is a mistake.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn that case,‚Äù replied the brigadier, ‚Äúwe can let him go?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCertainly,‚Äù replied the Bishop.
U||The gendarmes released Jean Valjean, who recoiled.
U||‚ÄúIs it true that I am to be released?‚Äù he said, in an almost inarticulate voice, and as though he were talking in his sleep.
U||‚ÄúYes, thou art released; dost thou not understand?‚Äù said one of the gendarmes.
U||‚ÄúMy friend,‚Äù resumed the Bishop, ‚Äúbefore you go, here are your candlesticks. Take them.‚Äù
U||He stepped to the chimney-piece, took the two silver candlesticks, and brought them to Jean Valjean. The two women looked on without uttering a word, without a gesture, without a look which could disconcert the Bishop.
U||Jean Valjean was trembling in every limb. He took the two candlesticks mechanically, and with a bewildered air.
U||‚ÄúNow,‚Äù said the Bishop, ‚Äúgo in peace. By the way, when you return, my friend, it is not necessary to pass through the garden. You can always enter and depart through the street door. It is never fastened with anything but a latch, either by day or by night.‚Äù
U||Then, turning to the gendarmes:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou may retire, gentlemen.‚Äù
U||The gendarmes retired.
U||Jean Valjean was like a man on the point of fainting.
U||The Bishop drew near to him, and said in a low voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDo not forget, never forget, that you have promised to use this money in becoming an honest man.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean, who had no recollection of ever having promised anything, remained speechless. The Bishop had emphasized the words when he uttered them. He resumed with solemnity:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúJean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. It is your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER XIII‚ÄîLITTLE GERVAIS
U||Jean Valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it. He set out at a very hasty pace through the fields, taking whatever roads and paths presented themselves to him, without perceiving that he was incessantly retracing his steps. He wandered thus the whole morning, without having eaten anything and without feeling hungry. He was the prey of a throng of novel sensations. He was conscious of a sort of rage; he did not know against whom it was directed. He could not have told whether he was touched or humiliated. There came over him at moments a strange emotion which he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired during the last twenty years of his life. This state of mind fatigued him. He perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within him. He asked himself what would replace this. At times he would have actually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes, and that things should not have happened in t
U||his way; it would have agitated him less. Although the season was tolerably far advanced, there were still a few late flowers in the hedge-rows here and there, whose odor as he passed through them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood. These memories were almost intolerable to him, it was so long since they had recurred to him.
U||Unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long.
U||As the sun declined to its setting, casting long shadows athwart the soil from every pebble, Jean Valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large ruddy plain, which was absolutely deserted. There was nothing on the horizon except the Alps. Not even the spire of a distant village. Jean Valjean might have been three leagues distant from D‚Äî‚Äî A path which intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush.
U||In the middle of this meditation, which would have contributed not a little to render his rags terrifying to any one who might have encountered him, a joyous sound became audible.
U||He turned his head and saw a little Savoyard, about ten years of age, coming up the path and singing, his hurdy-gurdy on his hip, and his marmot-box on his back.
U||One of those gay and gentle children, who go from land to land affording a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers.
U||Without stopping his song, the lad halted in his march from time to time, and played at knuckle-bones with some coins which he had in his hand‚Äîhis whole fortune, probably.
U||Among this money there was one forty-sou piece.
U||The child halted beside the bush, without perceiving Jean Valjean, and tossed up his handful of sous, which, up to that time, he had caught with a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand.
U||This time the forty-sou piece escaped him, and went rolling towards the brushwood until it reached Jean Valjean.
U||Jean Valjean set his foot upon it.
U||In the meantime, the child had looked after his coin and had caught sight of him.
U||He showed no astonishment, but walked straight up to the man.
U||The spot was absolutely solitary. As far as the eye could see there was not a person on the plain or on the path. The only sound was the tiny, feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage, which was traversing the heavens at an immense height. The child was standing with his back to the sun, which cast threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with its blood-red gleam the savage face of Jean Valjean.
U||‚ÄúSir,‚Äù said the little Savoyard, with that childish confidence which is composed of ignorance and innocence, ‚Äúmy money.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù said Jean Valjean.
U||‚ÄúLittle Gervais, sir.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGo away,‚Äù said Jean Valjean.
U||‚ÄúSir,‚Äù resumed the child, ‚Äúgive me back my money.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean dropped his head, and made no reply.
U||The child began again, ‚ÄúMy money, sir.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean‚Äôs eyes remained fixed on the earth.
U||‚ÄúMy piece of money!‚Äù cried the child, ‚Äúmy white piece! my silver!‚Äù
U||It seemed as though Jean Valjean did not hear him. The child grasped him by the collar of his blouse and shook him. At the same time he made an effort to displace the big iron-shod shoe which rested on his treasure.
U||‚ÄúI want my piece of money! my piece of forty sous!‚Äù
U||The child wept. Jean Valjean raised his head. He still remained seated. His eyes were troubled. He gazed at the child, in a sort of amazement, then he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a terrible voice, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI, sir,‚Äù replied the child. ‚ÄúLittle Gervais! I! Give me back my forty sous, if you please! Take your foot away, sir, if you please!‚Äù
U||Then irritated, though he was so small, and becoming almost menacing:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCome now, will you take your foot away? Take your foot away, or we‚Äôll see!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh! It‚Äôs still you!‚Äù said Jean Valjean, and rising abruptly to his feet, his foot still resting on the silver piece, he added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWill you take yourself off!‚Äù
U||The frightened child looked at him, then began to tremble from head to foot, and after a few moments of stupor he set out, running at the top of his speed, without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry.
U||Nevertheless, lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain distance, and Jean Valjean heard him sobbing, in the midst of his own reverie.
U||At the end of a few moments the child had disappeared.
U||The sun had set.
U||The shadows were descending around Jean Valjean. He had eaten nothing all day; it is probable that he was feverish.
U||He had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after the child‚Äôs flight. The breath heaved his chest at long and irregular intervals. His gaze, fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him, seemed to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass. All at once he shivered; he had just begun to feel the chill of evening.
U||He settled his cap more firmly on his brow, sought mechanically to cross and button his blouse, advanced a step and stopped to pick up his cudgel.
U||At that moment he caught sight of the forty-sou piece, which his foot had half ground into the earth, and which was shining among the pebbles. It was as though he had received a galvanic shock. ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù he muttered between his teeth. He recoiled three paces, then halted, without being able to detach his gaze from the spot which his foot had trodden but an instant before, as though the thing which lay glittering there in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him.
U||At the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the silver coin, seized it, and straightened himself up again and began to gaze afar off over the plain, at the same time casting his eyes towards all points of the horizon, as he stood there erect and shivering, like a terrified wild animal which is seeking refuge.
U||He saw nothing. Night was falling, the plain was cold and vague, great banks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight.
U||He said, ‚ÄúAh!‚Äù and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child had disappeared. After about thirty paces he paused, looked about him and saw nothing.
U||Then he shouted with all his might:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLittle Gervais! Little Gervais!‚Äù
U||He paused and waited.
U||There was no reply.
U||The landscape was gloomy and deserted. He was encompassed by space. There was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was lost, and a silence which engulfed his voice.
U||An icy north wind was blowing, and imparted to things around him a sort of lugubrious life. The bushes shook their thin little arms with incredible fury. One would have said that they were threatening and pursuing some one.
U||He set out on his march again, then he began to run; and from time to time he halted and shouted into that solitude, with a voice which was the most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to hear, ‚ÄúLittle Gervais! Little Gervais!‚Äù
U||Assuredly, if the child had heard him, he would have been alarmed and would have taken good care not to show himself. But the child was no doubt already far away.
U||He encountered a priest on horseback. He stepped up to him and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur le Cur√©, have you seen a child pass?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said the priest.
U||‚ÄúOne named Little Gervais?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have seen no one.‚Äù
U||He drew two five-franc pieces from his money-bag and handed them to the priest.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur le Cur√©, this is for your poor people. Monsieur le Cur√©, he was a little lad, about ten years old, with a marmot, I think, and a hurdy-gurdy. One of those Savoyards, you know?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have not seen him.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúLittle Gervais? There are no villages here? Can you tell me?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIf he is like what you say, my friend, he is a little stranger. Such persons pass through these parts. We know nothing of them.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence, and gave them to the priest.
U||‚ÄúFor your poor,‚Äù he said.
U||Then he added, wildly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur l‚ÄôAbb√©, have me arrested. I am a thief.‚Äù
U||The priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste, much alarmed.
U||Jean Valjean set out on a run, in the direction which he had first taken.
U||In this way he traversed a tolerably long distance, gazing, calling, shouting, but he met no one. Two or three times he ran across the plain towards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being reclining or crouching down; it turned out to be nothing but brushwood or rocks nearly on a level with the earth. At length, at a spot where three paths intersected each other, he stopped. The moon had risen. He sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time, ‚ÄúLittle Gervais! Little Gervais! Little Gervais!‚Äù His shout died away in the mist, without even awakening an echo. He murmured yet once more, ‚ÄúLittle Gervais!‚Äù but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice. It was his last effort; his legs gave way abruptly under him, as though an invisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil conscience; he fell exhausted, on a large stone, his fists clenched in his hair and his face on his knees, and he cried, ‚ÄúI am a wretch!‚Äù
U||Then his heart burst, and he began to cry. It was the first time that he had wept in nineteen years.
U||When Jean Valjean left the Bishop‚Äôs house, he was, as we have seen, quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto. He could not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him. He hardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the old man. ‚ÄúYou have promised me to become an honest man. I buy your soul. I take it away from the spirit of perversity; I give it to the good God.‚Äù
U||This recurred to his mind unceasingly. To this celestial kindness he opposed pride, which is the fortress of evil within us. He was indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest assault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet; that his obduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency; that if he yielded, he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul through so many years, and which pleased him; that this time it was necessary to conquer or to be conquered; and that a struggle, a colossal and final struggle, had been begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man.
U||In the presence of these lights, he proceeded like a man who is intoxicated. As he walked thus with haggard eyes, did he have a distinct perception of what might result to him from his adventure at D‚Äî‚Äî? Did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the spirit at certain moments of life? Did a voice whisper in his ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny; that there no longer remained a middle course for him; that if he were not henceforth the best of men, he would be the worst; that it behooved him now, so to speak, to mount higher than the Bishop, or fall lower than the convict; that if he wished to become good he must become an angel; that if he wished to remain evil, he must become a monster?
U||Here, again, some questions must be put, which we have already put to ourselves elsewhere: did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought, in a confused way? Misfortune certainly, as we have said, does form the education of the intelligence; nevertheless, it is doubtful whether Jean Valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have here indicated. If these ideas occurred to him, he but caught glimpses of, rather than saw them, and they only succeeded in throwing him into an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion. On emerging from that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys, the Bishop had hurt his soul, as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark. The future life, the possible life which offered itself to him henceforth, all pure and radiant, filled him with tremors and anxiety. He no longer knew where he really was. Like an owl, who should suddenly see the sun rise, the convict had been dazzled and blinded, as it were, by virtue.
U||That which was certain, that which he did not doubt, was that he was no longer the same man, that everything about him was changed, that it was no longer in his power to make it as though the Bishop had not spoken to him and had not touched him.
U||In this state of mind he had encountered little Gervais, and had robbed him of his forty sous. Why? He certainly could not have explained it; was this the last effect and the supreme effort, as it were, of the evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys,‚Äîa remnant of impulse, a result of what is called in statics, acquired force? It was that, and it was also, perhaps, even less than that. Let us say it simply, it was not he who stole; it was not the man; it was the beast, who, by habit and instinct, had simply placed his foot upon that money, while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hitherto unheard-of thoughts besetting it.
U||When intelligence reawakened and beheld that action of the brute, Jean Valjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror.
U||Awakened
U||It was because,‚Äîstrange phenomenon, and one which was possible only in the situation in which he found himself,‚Äîin stealing the money from that child, he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable.
U||However that may be, this last evil action had a decisive effect on him; it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind, and dispersed it, placed on one side the thick obscurity, and on the other the light, and acted on his soul, in the state in which it then was, as certain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating one element and clarifying the other.
U||First of all, even before examining himself and reflecting, all bewildered, like one who seeks to save himself, he tried to find the child in order to return his money to him; then, when he recognized the fact that this was impossible, he halted in despair. At the moment when he exclaimed ‚ÄúI am a wretch!‚Äù he had just perceived what he was, and he was already separated from himself to such a degree, that he seemed to himself to be no longer anything more than a phantom, and as if he had, there before him, in flesh and blood, the hideous galley-convict, Jean Valjean, cudgel in hand, his blouse on his hips, his knapsack filled with stolen objects on his back, with his resolute and gloomy visage, with his thoughts filled with abominable projects.
U||Excess of unhappiness had, as we have remarked, made him in some sort a visionary. This, then, was in the nature of a vision. He actually saw that Jean Valjean, that sinister face, before him. He had almost reached the point of asking himself who that man was, and he was horrified by him.
U||His brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm moments in which reverie is so profound that it absorbs reality. One no longer beholds the object which one has before one, and one sees, as though apart from one‚Äôs self, the figures which one has in one‚Äôs own mind.
U||Thus he contemplated himself, so to speak, face to face, and at the same time, athwart this hallucination, he perceived in a mysterious depth a sort of light which he at first took for a torch. On scrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience with more attention, he recognized the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch was the Bishop.
U||His conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it,‚Äîthe Bishop and Jean Valjean. Nothing less than the first was required to soften the second. By one of those singular effects, which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies, in proportion as his reverie continued, as the Bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes, so did Jean Valjean grow less and vanish. After a certain time he was no longer anything more than a shade. All at once he disappeared. The Bishop alone remained; he filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance.
U||Jean Valjean wept for a long time. He wept burning tears, he sobbed with more weakness than a woman, with more fright than a child.
U||As he wept, daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul; an extraordinary light; a light at once ravishing and terrible. His past life, his first fault, his long expiation, his external brutishness, his internal hardness, his dismissal to liberty, rejoicing in manifold plans of vengeance, what had happened to him at the Bishop‚Äôs, the last thing that he had done, that theft of forty sous from a child, a crime all the more cowardly, and all the more monstrous since it had come after the Bishop‚Äôs pardon,‚Äîall this recurred to his mind and appeared clearly to him, but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed. He examined his life, and it seemed horrible to him; his soul, and it seemed frightful to him. In the meantime a gentle light rested over this life and this soul. It seemed to him that he beheld Satan by the light of Paradise.
U||How many hours did he weep thus? What did he do after he had wept? Whither did he go! No one ever knew. The only thing which seems to be authenticated is that that same night the carrier who served Grenoble at that epoch, and who arrived at D‚Äî‚Äî about three o‚Äôclock in the morning, saw, as he traversed the street in which the Bishop‚Äôs residence was situated, a man in the attitude of prayer, kneeling on the pavement in the shadow, in front of the door of Monseigneur Welcome.
U||BOOK THIRD‚ÄîIN THE YEAR 1817
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîTHE YEAR 1817
U||1817 is the year which Louis XVIII., with a certain royal assurance which was not wanting in pride, entitled the twenty-second of his reign. It is the year in which M. Brugui√®re de Sorsum was celebrated. All the hairdressers‚Äô shops, hoping for powder and the return of the royal bird, were besmeared with azure and decked with fleurs-de-lys. It was the candid time at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as church-warden in the church-warden‚Äôs pew of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, in his costume of a peer of France, with his red ribbon and his long nose and the majesty of profile peculiar to a man who has performed a brilliant action. The brilliant action performed by M. Lynch was this: being mayor of Bordeaux, on the 12th of March, 1814, he had surrendered the city a little too promptly to M. the Duke d‚ÄôAngoul√™me. Hence his peerage. In 1817 fashion swallowed up little boys of from four to six years of age in vast caps of morocco leather with ear-tabs resembling Esquimaux mitres. The French army was dressed in 
U||white, after the mode of the Austrian; the regiments were called legions; instead of numbers they bore the names of departments; Napoleon was at St. Helena; and since England refused him green cloth, he was having his old coats turned. In 1817 Pelligrini sang; Mademoiselle Bigottini danced; Potier reigned; Odry did not yet exist. Madame Saqui had succeeded to Forioso. There were still Prussians in France. M. Delalot was a personage. Legitimacy had just asserted itself by cutting off the hand, then the head, of Pleignier, of Carbonneau, and of Tolleron. The Prince de Talleyrand, grand chamberlain, and the Abb√© Louis, appointed minister of finance, laughed as they looked at each other, with the laugh of the two augurs; both of them had celebrated, on the 14th of July, 1790, the mass of federation in the Champ de Mars; Talleyrand had said it as bishop, Louis had served it in the capacity of deacon. In 1817, in the side-alleys of this same Champ de Mars, two great cylinders of wood might have been seen lying in
U|| the rain, rotting amid the grass, painted blue, with traces of eagles and bees, from which the gilding was falling. These were the columns which two years before had upheld the Emperor‚Äôs platform in the Champ de Mai. They were blackened here and there with the scorches of the bivouac of Austrians encamped near Gros-Caillou. Two or three of these columns had disappeared in these bivouac fires, and had warmed the large hands of the Imperial troops. The Field of May had this remarkable point: that it had been held in the month of June and in the Field of March (Mars). In this year, 1817, two things were popular: the Voltaire-Touquet and the snuff-box √† la Charter. The most recent Parisian sensation was the crime of Dautun, who had thrown his brother‚Äôs head into the fountain of the Flower-Market.
U||They had begun to feel anxious at the Naval Department, on account of the lack of news from that fatal frigate, The Medusa, which was destined to cover Chaumareix with infamy and G√©ricault with glory. Colonel Selves was going to Egypt to become Soliman-Pasha. The palace of Thermes, in the Rue de La Harpe, served as a shop for a cooper. On the platform of the octagonal tower of the Hotel de Cluny, the little shed of boards, which had served as an observatory to Messier, the naval astronomer under Louis XVI., was still to be seen. The Duchesse de Duras read to three or four friends her unpublished Ourika, in her boudoir furnished by X. in sky-blue satin. The N‚Äôs were scratched off the Louvre. The bridge of Austerlitz had abdicated, and was entitled the bridge of the King‚Äôs Garden [du Jardin du Roi], a double enigma, which disguised the bridge of Austerlitz and the Jardin des Plantes at one stroke. Louis XVIII., much preoccupied while annotating Horace with the corner of his finger-nail, heroes who have be
U||come emperors, and makers of wooden shoes who have become dauphins, had two anxieties,‚ÄîNapoleon and Mathurin Bruneau. The French Academy had given for its prize subject, The Happiness procured through Study. M. Bellart was officially eloquent. In his shadow could be seen germinating that future advocate-general of Bro√´, dedicated to the sarcasms of Paul-Louis Courier. There was a false Chateaubriand, named Marchangy, in the interim, until there should be a false Marchangy, named d‚ÄôArlincourt. Claire d‚ÄôAlbe and Malek-Adel were masterpieces; Madame Cottin was proclaimed the chief writer of the epoch. The Institute had the academician, Napoleon Bonaparte, stricken from its list of members. A royal ordinance erected Angoul√™me into a naval school; for the Duc d‚ÄôAngoul√™me, being lord high admiral, it was evident that the city of Angoul√™me had all the qualities of a seaport; otherwise the monarchical principle would have received a wound. In the Council of Ministers the question was agitated whether vig
U||nettes representing slack-rope performances, which adorned Franconi‚Äôs advertising posters, and which attracted throngs of street urchins, should be tolerated. M. Pa√´r, the author of Agnese, a good sort of fellow, with a square face and a wart on his cheek, directed the little private concerts of the Marquise de Sasenaye in the Rue Ville l‚Äô√âv√™que. All the young girls were singing the Hermit of Saint-Avelle, with words by Edmond G√©raud. The Yellow Dwarf was transferred into Mirror. The Caf√© Lemblin stood up for the Emperor, against the Caf√© Valois, which upheld the Bourbons. The Duc de Berri, already surveyed from the shadow by Louvel, had just been married to a princess of Sicily. Madame de Sta√´l had died a year previously. The body-guard hissed Mademoiselle Mars. The grand newspapers were all very small. Their form was restricted, but their liberty was great. The Constitutionnel was constitutional. La Minerve called Chateaubriand Chateaubriant. That t made the good middle-class people laugh hearti
U||ly at the expense of the great writer. In journals which sold themselves, prostituted journalists, insulted the exiles of 1815. David had no longer any talent, Arnault had no longer any wit, Carnot was no longer honest, Soult had won no battles; it is true that Napoleon had no longer any genius. No one is ignorant of the fact that letters sent to an exile by post very rarely reached him, as the police made it their religious duty to intercept them. This is no new fact; Descartes complained of it in his exile. Now David, having, in a Belgian publication, shown some displeasure at not receiving letters which had been written to him, it struck the royalist journals as amusing; and they derided the prescribed man well on this occasion. What separated two men more than an abyss was to say, the regicides, or to say the voters; to say the enemies, or to say the allies; to say Napoleon, or to say Buonaparte. All sensible people were agreed that the era of revolution had been closed forever by King Louis XVIII., surn
U||amed ‚ÄúThe Immortal Author of the Charter.‚Äù On the platform of the Pont-Neuf, the word Redivivus was carved on the pedestal that awaited the statue of Henry IV. M. Piet, in the Rue Th√©r√®se, No. 4, was making the rough draft of his privy assembly to consolidate the monarchy. The leaders of the Right said at grave conjunctures, ‚ÄúWe must write to Bacot.‚Äù MM. Canuel, O‚ÄôMahoney, and De Chappedelaine were preparing the sketch, to some extent with Monsieur‚Äôs approval, of what was to become later on ‚ÄúThe Conspiracy of the Bord de l‚ÄôEau‚Äù‚Äîof the waterside. L‚Äô√âpingle Noire was already plotting in his own quarter. Delaverderie was conferring with Trogoff. M. Decazes, who was liberal to a degree, reigned. Chateaubriand stood every morning at his window at No. 27 Rue Saint-Dominique, clad in footed trousers, and slippers, with a madras kerchief knotted over his gray hair, with his eyes fixed on a mirror, a complete set of dentist‚Äôs instruments spread out before him, cleaning his teeth, which were
U|| charming, while he dictated The Monarchy according to the Charter to M. Pilorge, his secretary. Criticism, assuming an authoritative tone, preferred Lafon to Talma. M. de F√©letez signed himself A.; M. Hoffmann signed himself Z. Charles Nodier wrote Th√©r√®se Aubert. Divorce was abolished. Lyceums called themselves colleges. The collegians, decorated on the collar with a golden fleur-de-lys, fought each other apropos of the King of Rome. The counter-police of the ch√¢teau had denounced to her Royal Highness Madame, the portrait, everywhere exhibited, of M. the Duc d‚ÄôOrl√©ans, who made a better appearance in his uniform of a colonel-general of hussars than M. the Duc de Berri, in his uniform of colonel-general of dragoons‚Äîa serious inconvenience. The city of Paris was having the dome of the Invalides regilded at its own expense. Serious men asked themselves what M. de Trinquelague would do on such or such an occasion; M. Clausel de Montals differed on divers points from M. Clausel de Coussergues; M. de S
U||alaberry was not satisfied. The comedian Picard, who belonged to the Academy, which the comedian Moli√®re had not been able to do, had The Two Philiberts played at the Od√©on, upon whose pediment the removal of the letters still allowed THEATRE OF THE EMPRESS to be plainly read. People took part for or against Cugnet de Montarlot. Fabvier was factious; Bavoux was revolutionary. The Liberal, P√©licier, published an edition of Voltaire, with the following title: Works of Voltaire, of the French Academy. ‚ÄúThat will attract purchasers,‚Äù said the ingenious editor. The general opinion was that M. Charles Loyson would be the genius of the century; envy was beginning to gnaw at him‚Äîa sign of glory; and this verse was composed on him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúEven when Loyson steals, one feels that he has paws.‚Äù
U||As Cardinal Fesch refused to resign, M. de Pins, Archbishop of Amasie, administered the diocese of Lyons. The quarrel over the valley of Dappes was begun between Switzerland and France by a memoir from Captain, afterwards General Dufour. Saint-Simon, ignored, was erecting his sublime dream. There was a celebrated Fourier at the Academy of Science, whom posterity has forgotten; and in some garret an obscure Fourier, whom the future will recall. Lord Byron was beginning to make his mark; a note to a poem by Millevoye introduced him to France in these terms: a certain Lord Baron. David d‚ÄôAngers was trying to work in marble. The Abb√© Caron was speaking, in terms of praise, to a private gathering of seminarists in the blind alley of Feuillantines, of an unknown priest, named F√©licit√©-Robert, who, at a latter date, became Lamennais. A thing which smoked and clattered on the Seine with the noise of a swimming dog went and came beneath the windows of the Tuileries, from the Pont Royal to the Pont Louis XV.; it 
U||was a piece of mechanism which was not good for much; a sort of plaything, the idle dream of a dream-ridden inventor; an utopia‚Äîa steamboat. The Parisians stared indifferently at this useless thing. M. de Vaublanc, the reformer of the Institute by a coup d‚Äô√©tat, the distinguished author of numerous academicians, ordinances, and batches of members, after having created them, could not succeed in becoming one himself. The Faubourg Saint-Germain and the pavilion de Marsan wished to have M. Delaveau for prefect of police, on account of his piety. Dupuytren and R√©camier entered into a quarrel in the amphitheatre of the School of Medicine, and threatened each other with their fists on the subject of the divinity of Jesus Christ. Cuvier, with one eye on Genesis and the other on nature, tried to please bigoted reaction by reconciling fossils with texts and by making mastodons flatter Moses.
U||M. Fran√ßois de Neufch√¢teau, the praiseworthy cultivator of the memory of Parmentier, made a thousand efforts to have pomme de terre [potato] pronounced parmenti√®re, and succeeded therein not at all. The Abb√© Gr√©goire, ex-bishop, ex-conventionary, ex-senator, had passed, in the royalist polemics, to the state of ‚ÄúInfamous Gr√©goire.‚Äù The locution of which we have made use‚Äîpassed to the state of‚Äîhas been condemned as a neologism by M. Royer Collard. Under the third arch of the Pont de J√©na, the new stone with which, the two years previously, the mining aperture made by Bl√ºcher to blow up the bridge had been stopped up, was still recognizable on account of its whiteness. Justice summoned to its bar a man who, on seeing the Comte d‚ÄôArtois enter Notre Dame, had said aloud: ‚ÄúSapristi! I regret the time when I saw Bonaparte and Talma enter the Bel Sauvage, arm in arm.‚Äù A seditious utterance. Six months in prison. Traitors showed themselves unbuttoned; men who had gone over to the enemy on the e
U||ve of battle made no secret of their recompense, and strutted immodestly in the light of day, in the cynicism of riches and dignities; deserters from Ligny and Quatre-Bras, in the brazenness of their well-paid turpitude, exhibited their devotion to the monarchy in the most barefaced manner.
U||This is what floats up confusedly, pell-mell, for the year 1817, and is now forgotten. History neglects nearly all these particulars, and cannot do otherwise; the infinity would overwhelm it. Nevertheless, these details, which are wrongly called trivial,‚Äîthere are no trivial facts in humanity, nor little leaves in vegetation,‚Äîare useful. It is of the physiognomy of the years that the physiognomy of the centuries is composed. In this year of 1817 four young Parisians arranged ‚Äúa fine farce.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîA DOUBLE QUARTETTE
U||These Parisians came, one from Toulouse, another from Limoges, the third from Cahors, and the fourth from Montauban; but they were students; and when one says student, one says Parisian: to study in Paris is to be born in Paris.
U||These young men were insignificant; every one has seen such faces; four specimens of humanity taken at random; neither good nor bad, neither wise nor ignorant, neither geniuses nor fools; handsome, with that charming April which is called twenty years. They were four Oscars; for, at that epoch, Arthurs did not yet exist. Burn for him the perfumes of Araby! exclaimed romance. Oscar advances. Oscar, I shall behold him! People had just emerged from Ossian; elegance was Scandinavian and Caledonian; the pure English style was only to prevail later, and the first of the Arthurs, Wellington, had but just won the battle of Waterloo.
U||These Oscars bore the names, one of F√©lix Tholomy√®s, of Toulouse; the second, Listolier, of Cahors; the next, Fameuil, of Limoges; the last, Blachevelle, of Montauban. Naturally, each of them had his mistress. Blachevelle loved Favourite, so named because she had been in England; Listolier adored Dahlia, who had taken for her nickname the name of a flower; Fameuil idolized Z√©phine, an abridgment of Jos√©phine; Tholomy√®s had Fantine, called the Blonde, because of her beautiful, sunny hair.
U||Favourite, Dahlia, Z√©phine, and Fantine were four ravishing young women, perfumed and radiant, still a little like working-women, and not yet entirely divorced from their needles; somewhat disturbed by intrigues, but still retaining on their faces something of the serenity of toil, and in their souls that flower of honesty which survives the first fall in woman. One of the four was called the young, because she was the youngest of them, and one was called the old; the old one was twenty-three. Not to conceal anything, the three first were more experienced, more heedless, and more emancipated into the tumult of life than Fantine the Blonde, who was still in her first illusions.
U||Dahlia, Z√©phine, and especially Favourite, could not have said as much. There had already been more than one episode in their romance, though hardly begun; and the lover who had borne the name of Adolph in the first chapter had turned out to be Alphonse in the second, and Gustave in the third. Poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors; one scolds and the other flatters, and the beautiful daughters of the people have both of them whispering in their ear, each on its own side. These badly guarded souls listen. Hence the falls which they accomplish, and the stones which are thrown at them. They are overwhelmed with splendor of all that is immaculate and inaccessible. Alas! what if the Jungfrau were hungry?
U||Favourite having been in England, was admired by Dahlia and Z√©phine. She had had an establishment of her own very early in life. Her father was an old unmarried professor of mathematics, a brutal man and a braggart, who went out to give lessons in spite of his age. This professor, when he was a young man, had one day seen a chambermaid‚Äôs gown catch on a fender; he had fallen in love in consequence of this accident. The result had been Favourite. She met her father from time to time, and he bowed to her. One morning an old woman with the air of a devotee, had entered her apartments, and had said to her, ‚ÄúYou do not know me, Mamemoiselle?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am your mother.‚Äù Then the old woman opened the sideboard, and ate and drank, had a mattress which she owned brought in, and installed herself. This cross and pious old mother never spoke to Favourite, remained hours without uttering a word, breakfasted, dined, and supped for four, and went down to the porter‚Äôs quarters for company, where she spoke i
U||ll of her daughter.
U||It was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn Dahlia to Listolier, to others perhaps, to idleness. How could she make such nails work? She who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her hands. As for Z√©phine, she had conquered Fameuil by her roguish and caressing little way of saying ‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù
U||The young men were comrades; the young girls were friends. Such loves are always accompanied by such friendships.
U||Goodness and philosophy are two distinct things; the proof of this is that, after making all due allowances for these little irregular households, Favourite, Z√©phine, and Dahlia were philosophical young women, while Fantine was a good girl.
U||Good! some one will exclaim; and Tholomy√®s? Solomon would reply that love forms a part of wisdom. We will confine ourselves to saying that the love of Fantine was a first love, a sole love, a faithful love.
U||She alone, of all the four, was not called ‚Äúthou‚Äù by a single one of them.
U||Fantine was one of those beings who blossom, so to speak, from the dregs of the people. Though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depths of social shadow, she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous and the unknown. She was born at M. sur M. Of what parents? Who can say? She had never known father or mother. She was called Fantine. Why Fantine? She had never borne any other name. At the epoch of her birth the Directory still existed. She had no family name; she had no family; no baptismal name; the Church no longer existed. She bore the name which pleased the first random passer-by, who had encountered her, when a very small child, running bare-legged in the street. She received the name as she received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it rained. She was called little Fantine. No one knew more than that. This human creature had entered life in just this way. At the age of ten, Fantine quitted the town and went to service with some farmers in the neighborhood. At fifteen she came to Par
U||is ‚Äúto seek her fortune.‚Äù Fantine was beautiful, and remained pure as long as she could. She was a lovely blonde, with fine teeth. She had gold and pearls for her dowry; but her gold was on her head, and her pearls were in her mouth.
U||She worked for her living; then, still for the sake of her living,‚Äîfor the heart, also, has its hunger,‚Äîshe loved.
U||She loved Tholomy√®s.
U||An amour for him; passion for her. The streets of the Latin quarter, filled with throngs of students and grisettes, saw the beginning of their dream. Fantine had long evaded Tholomy√®s in the mazes of the hill of the Pantheon, where so many adventurers twine and untwine, but in such a way as constantly to encounter him again. There is a way of avoiding which resembles seeking. In short, the eclogue took place.
U||Blachevelle, Listolier, and Fameuil formed a sort of group of which Tholomy√®s was the head. It was he who possessed the wit.
U||Tholomy√®s was the antique old student; he was rich; he had an income of four thousand francs; four thousand francs! a splendid scandal on Mount Sainte-Genevi√®ve. Tholomy√®s was a fast man of thirty, and badly preserved. He was wrinkled and toothless, and he had the beginning of a bald spot, of which he himself said with sadness, the skull at thirty, the knee at forty. His digestion was mediocre, and he had been attacked by a watering in one eye. But in proportion as his youth disappeared, gayety was kindled; he replaced his teeth with buffooneries, his hair with mirth, his health with irony, his weeping eye laughed incessantly. He was dilapidated but still in flower. His youth, which was packing up for departure long before its time, beat a retreat in good order, bursting with laughter, and no one saw anything but fire. He had had a piece rejected at the Vaudeville. He made a few verses now and then. In addition to this he doubted everything to the last degree, which is a vast force in the eyes of the weak
U||. Being thus ironical and bald, he was the leader. Iron is an English word. Is it possible that irony is derived from it?
U||One day Tholomy√®s took the three others aside, with the gesture of an oracle, and said to them:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFantine, Dahlia, Z√©phine, and Favourite have been teasing us for nearly a year to give them a surprise. We have promised them solemnly that we would. They are forever talking about it to us, to me in particular, just as the old women in Naples cry to Saint Januarius, ‚ÄòFaccia gialluta, fa o miracolo, Yellow face, perform thy miracle,‚Äô so our beauties say to me incessantly, ‚ÄòTholomy√®s, when will you bring forth your surprise?‚Äô At the same time our parents keep writing to us. Pressure on both sides. The moment has arrived, it seems to me; let us discuss the question.‚Äù
U||Thereupon, Tholomy√®s lowered his voice and articulated something so mirthful, that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the four mouths simultaneously, and Blachevelle exclaimed, ‚ÄúThat is an idea.‚Äù
U||A smoky tap-room presented itself; they entered, and the remainder of their confidential colloquy was lost in shadow.
U||The result of these shades was a dazzling pleasure party which took place on the following Sunday, the four young men inviting the four young girls.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîFOUR AND FOUR
U||It is hard nowadays to picture to one‚Äôs self what a pleasure-trip of students and grisettes to the country was like, forty-five years ago. The suburbs of Paris are no longer the same; the physiognomy of what may be called circumparisian life has changed completely in the last half-century; where there was the cuckoo, there is the railway car; where there was a tender-boat, there is now the steamboat; people speak of F√©camp nowadays as they spoke of Saint-Cloud in those days. The Paris of 1862 is a city which has France for its outskirts.
U||The four couples conscientiously went through with all the country follies possible at that time. The vacation was beginning, and it was a warm, bright, summer day. On the preceding day, Favourite, the only one who knew how to write, had written the following to Tholomy√®s in the name of the four: ‚ÄúIt is a good hour to emerge from happiness.‚Äù That is why they rose at five o‚Äôclock in the morning. Then they went to Saint-Cloud by the coach, looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed, ‚ÄúThis must be very beautiful when there is water!‚Äù They breakfasted at the T√™te-Noir, where Castaing had not yet been; they treated themselves to a game of ring-throwing under the quincunx of trees of the grand fountain; they ascended Diogenes‚Äô lantern, they gambled for macaroons at the roulette establishment of the Pont de S√®vres, picked bouquets at Pateaux, bought reed-pipes at Neuilly, ate apple tarts everywhere, and were perfectly happy.
U||The young girls rustled and chatted like warblers escaped from their cage. It was a perfect delirium. From time to time they bestowed little taps on the young men. Matutinal intoxication of life! adorable years! the wings of the dragonfly quiver. Oh, whoever you may be, do you not remember? Have you rambled through the brushwood, holding aside the branches, on account of the charming head which is coming on behind you? Have you slid, laughing, down a slope all wet with rain, with a beloved woman holding your hand, and crying, ‚ÄúAh, my new boots! what a state they are in!‚Äù
U||Let us say at once that that merry obstacle, a shower, was lacking in the case of this good-humored party, although Favourite had said as they set out, with a magisterial and maternal tone, ‚ÄúThe slugs are crawling in the paths,‚Äîa sign of rain, children.‚Äù
U||All four were madly pretty. A good old classic poet, then famous, a good fellow who had an √âl√©onore, M. le Chevalier de Labouisse, as he strolled that day beneath the chestnut-trees of Saint-Cloud, saw them pass about ten o‚Äôclock in the morning, and exclaimed, ‚ÄúThere is one too many of them,‚Äù as he thought of the Graces. Favourite, Blachevelle‚Äôs friend, the one aged three and twenty, the old one, ran on in front under the great green boughs, jumped the ditches, stalked distractedly over bushes, and presided over this merry-making with the spirit of a young female faun. Z√©phine and Dahlia, whom chance had made beautiful in such a way that they set each off when they were together, and completed each other, never left each other, more from an instinct of coquetry than from friendship, and clinging to each other, they assumed English poses; the first keepsakes had just made their appearance, melancholy was dawning for women, as later on, Byronism dawned for men; and the hair of the tender sex began t
U||o droop dolefully. Z√©phine and Dahlia had their hair dressed in rolls. Listolier and Fameuil, who were engaged in discussing their professors, explained to Fantine the difference that existed between M. Delvincourt and M. Blondeau.
U||Blachevelle seemed to have been created expressly to carry Favourite‚Äôs single-bordered, imitation India shawl of Ternaux‚Äôs manufacture, on his arm on Sundays.
U||Tholomy√®s followed, dominating the group. He was very gay, but one felt the force of government in him; there was dictation in his joviality; his principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant-leg pattern of nankeen, with straps of braided copper wire; he carried a stout rattan worth two hundred francs in his hand, and, as he treated himself to everything, a strange thing called a cigar in his mouth. Nothing was sacred to him; he smoked.
U||‚ÄúThat Tholomy√®s is astounding!‚Äù said the others, with veneration. ‚ÄúWhat trousers! What energy!‚Äù
U||As for Fantine, she was a joy to behold. Her splendid teeth had evidently received an office from God,‚Äîlaughter. She preferred to carry her little hat of sewed straw, with its long white strings, in her hand rather than on her head. Her thick blond hair, which was inclined to wave, and which easily uncoiled, and which it was necessary to fasten up incessantly, seemed made for the flight of Galatea under the willows. Her rosy lips babbled enchantingly. The corners of her mouth voluptuously turned up, as in the antique masks of Erigone, had an air of encouraging the audacious; but her long, shadowy lashes drooped discreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as though to call a halt. There was something indescribably harmonious and striking about her entire dress. She wore a gown of mauve bar√®ge, little reddish brown buskins, whose ribbons traced an X on her fine, white, open-worked stockings, and that sort of muslin spencer, a Marseilles invention, whose name, canezou, a corruption of the words
U|| quinze ao√ªt, pronounced after the fashion of the Canebi√®re, signifies fine weather, heat, and midday. The three others, less timid, as we have already said, wore low-necked dresses without disguise, which in summer, beneath flower-adorned hats, are very graceful and enticing; but by the side of these audacious outfits, blond Fantine‚Äôs canezou, with its transparencies, its indiscretion, and its reticence, concealing and displaying at one and the same time, seemed an alluring godsend of decency, and the famous Court of Love, presided over by the Vicomtesse de Cette, with the sea-green eyes, would, perhaps, have awarded the prize for coquetry to this canezou, in the contest for the prize of modesty. The most ingenious is, at times, the wisest. This does happen.
U||Brilliant of face, delicate of profile, with eyes of a deep blue, heavy lids, feet arched and small, wrists and ankles admirably formed, a white skin which, here and there allowed the azure branching of the veins to be seen, joy, a cheek that was young and fresh, the robust throat of the Juno of √Ügina, a strong and supple nape of the neck, shoulders modelled as though by Coustou, with a voluptuous dimple in the middle, visible through the muslin; a gayety cooled by dreaminess; sculptural and exquisite‚Äîsuch was Fantine; and beneath these feminine adornments and these ribbons one could divine a statue, and in that statue a soul.
U||Fantine was beautiful, without being too conscious of it. Those rare dreamers, mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confront everything with perfection, would have caught a glimpse in this little working-woman, through the transparency of her Parisian grace, of the ancient sacred euphony. This daughter of the shadows was thoroughbred. She was beautiful in the two ways‚Äîstyle and rhythm. Style is the form of the ideal; rhythm is its movement.
U||We have said that Fantine was joy; she was also modesty.
U||To an observer who studied her attentively, that which breathed from her athwart all the intoxication of her age, the season, and her love affair, was an invincible expression of reserve and modesty. She remained a little astonished. This chaste astonishment is the shade of difference which separates Psyche from Venus. Fantine had the long, white, fine fingers of the vestal virgin who stirs the ashes of the sacred fire with a golden pin. Although she would have refused nothing to Tholomy√®s, as we shall have more than ample opportunity to see, her face in repose was supremely virginal; a sort of serious and almost austere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times, and there was nothing more singular and disturbing than to see gayety become so suddenly extinct there, and meditation succeed to cheerfulness without any transition state. This sudden and sometimes severely accentuated gravity resembled the disdain of a goddess. Her brow, her nose, her chin, presented that equilibrium of outline which is q
U||uite distinct from equilibrium of proportion, and from which harmony of countenance results; in the very characteristic interval which separates the base of the nose from the upper lip, she had that imperceptible and charming fold, a mysterious sign of chastity, which makes Barberousse fall in love with a Diana found in the treasures of Iconia.
U||Love is a fault; so be it. Fantine was innocence floating high over fault.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîTHOLOMY√àS IS SO MERRY THAT HE SINGS A SPANISH DITTY
U||That day was composed of dawn, from one end to the other. All nature seemed to be having a holiday, and to be laughing. The flower-beds of Saint-Cloud perfumed the air; the breath of the Seine rustled the leaves vaguely; the branches gesticulated in the wind, bees pillaged the jasmines; a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon the yarrow, the clover, and the sterile oats; in the august park of the King of France there was a pack of vagabonds, the birds.
U||The four merry couples, mingled with the sun, the fields, the flowers, the trees, were resplendent.
U||And in this community of Paradise, talking, singing, running, dancing, chasing butterflies, plucking convolvulus, wetting their pink, open-work stockings in the tall grass, fresh, wild, without malice, all received, to some extent, the kisses of all, with the exception of Fantine, who was hedged about with that vague resistance of hers composed of dreaminess and wildness, and who was in love. ‚ÄúYou always have a queer look about you,‚Äù said Favourite to her.
U||Such things are joys. These passages of happy couples are a profound appeal to life and nature, and make a caress and light spring forth from everything. There was once a fairy who created the fields and forests expressly for those in love,‚Äîin that eternal hedge-school of lovers, which is forever beginning anew, and which will last as long as there are hedges and scholars. Hence the popularity of spring among thinkers. The patrician and the knife-grinder, the duke and the peer, the limb of the law, the courtiers and townspeople, as they used to say in olden times, all are subjects of this fairy. They laugh and hunt, and there is in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis‚Äîwhat a transfiguration effected by love! Notaries‚Äô clerks are gods. And the little cries, the pursuits through the grass, the waists embraced on the fly, those jargons which are melodies, those adorations which burst forth in the manner of pronouncing a syllable, those cherries torn from one mouth by another,‚Äîall this blazes forth an
U||d takes its place among the celestial glories. Beautiful women waste themselves sweetly. They think that this will never come to an end. Philosophers, poets, painters, observe these ecstasies and know not what to make of it, so greatly are they dazzled by it. The departure for Cythera! exclaims Watteau; Lancret, the painter of plebeians, contemplates his bourgeois, who have flitted away into the azure sky; Diderot stretches out his arms to all these love idyls, and d‚ÄôUrf√© mingles druids with them.
U||After breakfast the four couples went to what was then called the King‚Äôs Square to see a newly arrived plant from India, whose name escapes our memory at this moment, and which, at that epoch, was attracting all Paris to Saint-Cloud. It was an odd and charming shrub with a long stem, whose numerous branches, bristling and leafless and as fine as threads, were covered with a million tiny white rosettes; this gave the shrub the air of a head of hair studded with flowers. There was always an admiring crowd about it.
U||After viewing the shrub, Tholomy√®s exclaimed, ‚ÄúI offer you asses!‚Äù and having agreed upon a price with the owner of the asses, they returned by way of Vanvres and Issy. At Issy an incident occurred. The truly national park, at that time owned by Bourguin the contractor, happened to be wide open. They passed the gates, visited the manikin anchorite in his grotto, tried the mysterious little effects of the famous cabinet of mirrors, the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become a millionaire or of Turcaret metamorphosed into a Priapus. They had stoutly shaken the swing attached to the two chestnut-trees celebrated by the Abb√© de Bernis. As he swung these beauties, one after the other, producing folds in the fluttering skirts which Greuze would have found to his taste, amid peals of laughter, the Toulousan Tholomy√®s, who was somewhat of a Spaniard, Toulouse being the cousin of Tolosa, sang, to a melancholy chant, the old ballad gallega, probably inspired by some lovely maid dashing in full flight upon a rope 
U||between two trees:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSoy de Badajoz,
U||Amor me llama,
U||Toda mi alma,
U||Es en mi ojos,
U||Porque ense√±as,
U||A tuas piernas.
U||‚ÄúBadajoz is my home,
U||And Love is my name;
U||To my eyes in flame,
U||All my soul doth come;
U||For instruction meet
U||I receive at thy feet‚Äù
U||Fantine alone refused to swing.
U||‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to have people put on airs like that,‚Äù muttered Favourite, with a good deal of acrimony.
U||After leaving the asses there was a fresh delight; they crossed the Seine in a boat, and proceeding from Passy on foot they reached the barrier of l‚Äô√âtoile. They had been up since five o‚Äôclock that morning, as the reader will remember; but bah! there is no such thing as fatigue on Sunday, said Favourite; on Sunday fatigue does not work.
U||About three o‚Äôclock the four couples, frightened at their happiness, were sliding down the Russian mountains, a singular edifice which then occupied the heights of Beaujon, and whose undulating line was visible above the trees of the Champs-√âlys√©es.
U||From time to time Favourite exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd the surprise? I claim the surprise.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPatience,‚Äù replied Tholomy√®s.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîAT BOMBARDA‚ÄôS
U||The Russian mountains having been exhausted, they began to think about dinner; and the radiant party of eight, somewhat weary at last, became stranded in Bombarda‚Äôs public house, a branch establishment which had been set up in the Champs-√âlys√©es by that famous restaurant-keeper, Bombarda, whose sign could then be seen in the Rue de Rivoli, near Delorme Alley.
U||A large but ugly room, with an alcove and a bed at the end (they had been obliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the Sunday crowd); two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms, the quay and the river; a magnificent August sunlight lightly touching the panes; two tables; upon one of them a triumphant mountain of bouquets, mingled with the hats of men and women; at the other the four couples seated round a merry confusion of platters, dishes, glasses, and bottles; jugs of beer mingled with flasks of wine; very little order on the table, some disorder beneath it;
U||‚ÄúThey made beneath the table
U||A noise, a clatter of the feet that was abominable,‚Äù
U||says Moli√®re.
U||This was the state which the shepherd idyl, begun at five o‚Äôclock in the morning, had reached at half-past four in the afternoon. The sun was setting; their appetites were satisfied.
U||The Champs-√âlys√©es, filled with sunshine and with people, were nothing but light and dust, the two things of which glory is composed. The horses of Marly, those neighing marbles, were prancing in a cloud of gold. Carriages were going and coming. A squadron of magnificent body-guards, with their clarions at their head, were descending the Avenue de Neuilly; the white flag, showing faintly rosy in the setting sun, floated over the dome of the Tuileries. The Place de la Concorde, which had become the Place Louis XV. once more, was choked with happy promenaders. Many wore the silver fleur-de-lys suspended from the white-watered ribbon, which had not yet wholly disappeared from button-holes in the year 1817. Here and there choruses of little girls threw to the winds, amid the passers-by, who formed into circles and applauded, the then celebrated Bourbon air, which was destined to strike the Hundred Days with lightning, and which had for its refrain:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúRendez-nous notre p√®re de Gand,
U||Rendez-nous notre p√®re.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGive us back our father from Ghent,
U||Give us back our father.‚Äù
U||Groups of dwellers in the suburbs, in Sunday array, sometimes even decorated with the fleur-de-lys, like the bourgeois, scattered over the large square and the Marigny square, were playing at rings and revolving on the wooden horses; others were engaged in drinking; some journeyman printers had on paper caps; their laughter was audible. Everything was radiant. It was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalist security; it was the epoch when a special and private report of Chief of Police Angl√®s to the King, on the subject of the suburbs of Paris, terminated with these lines:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúTaking all things into consideration, Sire, there is nothing to be feared from these people. They are as heedless and as indolent as cats. The populace is restless in the provinces; it is not in Paris. These are very pretty men, Sire. It would take all of two of them to make one of your grenadiers. There is nothing to be feared on the part of the populace of Paris the capital. It is remarkable that the stature of this population should have diminished in the last fifty years; and the populace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the Revolution. It is not dangerous. In short, it is an amiable rabble.‚Äù
U||Prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transform itself into a lion; that does happen, however, and in that lies the miracle wrought by the populace of Paris. Moreover, the cat so despised by Count Angl√®s possessed the esteem of the republics of old. In their eyes it was liberty incarnate; and as though to serve as pendant to the Minerva Aptera of the Pir√¶us, there stood on the public square in Corinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat. The ingenuous police of the Restoration beheld the populace of Paris in too ‚Äúrose-colored‚Äù a light; it is not so much of ‚Äúan amiable rabble‚Äù as it is thought. The Parisian is to the Frenchman what the Athenian was to the Greek: no one sleeps more soundly than he, no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than he, no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness; let him not be trusted nevertheless; he is ready for any sort of cool deed; but when there is glory at the end of it, he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury. Give him a pi
U||ke, he will produce the 10th of August; give him a gun, you will have Austerlitz. He is Napoleon‚Äôs stay and Danton‚Äôs resource. Is it a question of country, he enlists; is it a question of liberty, he tears up the pavements. Beware! his hair filled with wrath, is epic; his blouse drapes itself like the folds of a chlamys. Take care! he will make of the first Rue Gren√©tat which comes to hand Caudine Forks. When the hour strikes, this man of the faubourgs will grow in stature; this little man will arise, and his gaze will be terrible, and his breath will become a tempest, and there will issue forth from that slender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds of the Alps. It is, thanks to the suburban man of Paris, that the Revolution, mixed with arms, conquers Europe. He sings; it is his delight. Proportion his song to his nature, and you will see! As long as he has for refrain nothing but la Carmagnole, he only overthrows Louis XVI.; make him sing the Marseillaise, and he will free the world.
U||This note jotted down on the margin of Angl√®s‚Äô report, we will return to our four couples. The dinner, as we have said, was drawing to its close.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîA CHAPTER IN WHICH THEY ADORE EACH OTHER
U||Chat at table, the chat of love; it is as impossible to reproduce one as the other; the chat of love is a cloud; the chat at table is smoke.
U||Fameuil and Dahlia were humming. Tholomy√®s was drinking. Z√©phine was laughing, Fantine smiling, Listolier blowing a wooden trumpet which he had purchased at Saint-Cloud.
U||Favourite gazed tenderly at Blachevelle and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBlachevelle, I adore you.‚Äù
U||This called forth a question from Blachevelle:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat would you do, Favourite, if I were to cease to love you?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI!‚Äù cried Favourite. ‚ÄúAh! Do not say that even in jest! If you were to cease to love me, I would spring after you, I would scratch you, I should rend you, I would throw you into the water, I would have you arrested.‚Äù
U||Blachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self-conceit of a man who is tickled in his self-love. Favourite resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYes, I would scream to the police! Ah! I should not restrain myself, not at all! Rabble!‚Äù
U||Blachevelle threw himself back in his chair, in an ecstasy, and closed both eyes proudly.
U||Dahlia, as she ate, said in a low voice to Favourite, amid the uproar:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSo you really idolize him deeply, that Blachevelle of yours?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI? I detest him,‚Äù replied Favourite in the same tone, seizing her fork again. ‚ÄúHe is avaricious. I love the little fellow opposite me in my house. He is very nice, that young man; do you know him? One can see that he is an actor by profession. I love actors. As soon as he comes in, his mother says to him: ‚ÄòAh! mon Dieu! my peace of mind is gone. There he goes with his shouting. But, my dear, you are splitting my head!‚Äô So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets, to black holes, as high as he can mount, and there he sets to singing, declaiming, how do I know what? so that he can be heard downstairs! He earns twenty sous a day at an attorney‚Äôs by penning quibbles. He is the son of a former precentor of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. Ah! he is very nice. He idolizes me so, that one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes, he said to me: ‚ÄòMamselle, make your gloves into fritters, and I will eat them.‚Äô It is only artists who can say such things as that. Ah! he is very nice. I am in a fair way to 
U||go out of my head over that little fellow. Never mind; I tell Blachevelle that I adore him‚Äîhow I lie! Hey! How I do lie!‚Äù
U||Favourite paused, and then went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am sad, you see, Dahlia. It has done nothing but rain all summer; the wind irritates me; the wind does not abate. Blachevelle is very stingy; there are hardly any green peas in the market; one does not know what to eat. I have the spleen, as the English say, butter is so dear! and then you see it is horrible, here we are dining in a room with a bed in it, and that disgusts me with life.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîTHE WISDOM OF THOLOMY√àS
U||In the meantime, while some sang, the rest talked together tumultuously all at once; it was no longer anything but noise. Tholomy√®s intervened.
U||‚ÄúLet us not talk at random nor too fast,‚Äù he exclaimed. ‚ÄúLet us reflect, if we wish to be brilliant. Too much improvisation empties the mind in a stupid way. Running beer gathers no froth. No haste, gentlemen. Let us mingle majesty with the feast. Let us eat with meditation; let us make haste slowly. Let us not hurry. Consider the springtime; if it makes haste, it is done for; that is to say, it gets frozen. Excess of zeal ruins peach-trees and apricot-trees. Excess of zeal kills the grace and the mirth of good dinners. No zeal, gentlemen! Grimod de la Reyni√®re agrees with Talleyrand.‚Äù
U||A hollow sound of rebellion rumbled through the group.
U||‚ÄúLeave us in peace, Tholomy√®s,‚Äù said Blachevelle.
U||‚ÄúDown with the tyrant!‚Äù said Fameuil.
U||‚ÄúBombarda, Bombance, and Bambochel!‚Äù cried Listolier.
U||‚ÄúSunday exists,‚Äù resumed Fameuil.
U||‚ÄúWe are sober,‚Äù added Listolier.
U||‚ÄúTholomy√®s,‚Äù remarked Blachevelle, ‚Äúcontemplate my calmness [mon calme].‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are the Marquis of that,‚Äù retorted Tholomy√®s.
U||This mediocre play upon words produced the effect of a stone in a pool. The Marquis de Montcalm was at that time a celebrated royalist. All the frogs held their peace.
U||‚ÄúFriends,‚Äù cried Tholomy√®s, with the accent of a man who had recovered his empire, ‚ÄúCome to yourselves. This pun which has fallen from the skies must not be received with too much stupor. Everything which falls in that way is not necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect. The pun is the dung of the mind which soars. The jest falls, no matter where; and the mind after producing a piece of stupidity plunges into the azure depths. A whitish speck flattened against the rock does not prevent the condor from soaring aloft. Far be it from me to insult the pun! I honor it in proportion to its merits; nothing more. All the most august, the most sublime, the most charming of humanity, and perhaps outside of humanity, have made puns. Jesus Christ made a pun on St. Peter, Moses on Isaac, √Üschylus on Polynices, Cleopatra on Octavius. And observe that Cleopatra‚Äôs pun preceded the battle of Actium, and that had it not been for it, no one would have remembered the city of Toryne, a Greek name which signifies a 
U||ladle. That once conceded, I return to my exhortation. I repeat, brothers, I repeat, no zeal, no hubbub, no excess; even in witticisms, gayety, jollities, or plays on words. Listen to me. I have the prudence of Amphiara√ºs and the baldness of C√¶sar. There must be a limit, even to rebuses. Est modus in rebus.
U||‚ÄúThere must be a limit, even to dinners. You are fond of apple turnovers, ladies; do not indulge in them to excess. Even in the matter of turnovers, good sense and art are requisite. Gluttony chastises the glutton, Gula punit Gulax. Indigestion is charged by the good God with preaching morality to stomachs. And remember this: each one of our passions, even love, has a stomach which must not be filled too full. In all things the word finis must be written in good season; self-control must be exercised when the matter becomes urgent; the bolt must be drawn on appetite; one must set one‚Äôs own fantasy to the violin, and carry one‚Äôs self to the post. The sage is the man who knows how, at a given moment, to effect his own arrest. Have some confidence in me, for I have succeeded to some extent in my study of the law, according to the verdict of my examinations, for I know the difference between the question put and the question pending, for I have sustained a thesis in Latin upon the manner in which torture w
U||as administered at Rome at the epoch when Munatius Demens was qu√¶stor of the Parricide; because I am going to be a doctor, apparently it does not follow that it is absolutely necessary that I should be an imbecile. I recommend you to moderation in your desires. It is true that my name is F√©lix Tholomy√®s; I speak well. Happy is he who, when the hour strikes, takes a heroic resolve, and abdicates like Sylla or Origenes.‚Äù
U||Favourite listened with profound attention.
U||‚ÄúF√©lix,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúwhat a pretty word! I love that name. It is Latin; it means prosper.‚Äù
U||Tholomy√®s went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúQuirites, gentlemen, caballeros, my friends. Do you wish never to feel the prick, to do without the nuptial bed, and to brave love? Nothing more simple. Here is the receipt: lemonade, excessive exercise, hard labor; work yourself to death, drag blocks, sleep not, hold vigil, gorge yourself with nitrous beverages, and potions of nymph√¶as; drink emulsions of poppies and agnus castus; season this with a strict diet, starve yourself, and add thereto cold baths, girdles of herbs, the application of a plate of lead, lotions made with the subacetate of lead, and fomentations of oxycrat.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI prefer a woman,‚Äù said Listolier.
U||‚ÄúWoman,‚Äù resumed Tholomy√®s; ‚Äúdistrust her. Woe to him who yields himself to the unstable heart of woman! Woman is perfidious and disingenuous. She detests the serpent from professional jealousy. The serpent is the shop over the way.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTholomy√®s!‚Äù cried Blachevelle, ‚Äúyou are drunk!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPardieu,‚Äù said Tholomy√®s.
U||‚ÄúThen be gay,‚Äù resumed Blachevelle.
U||‚ÄúI agree to that,‚Äù responded Tholomy√®s.
U||And, refilling his glass, he rose.
U||‚ÄúGlory to wine! Nunc te, Bacche, canam! Pardon me ladies; that is Spanish. And the proof of it, se√±oras, is this: like people, like cask. The arrobe of Castille contains sixteen litres; the cantaro of Alicante, twelve; the almude of the Canaries, twenty-five; the cuartin of the Balearic Isles, twenty-six; the boot of Tzar Peter, thirty. Long live that Tzar who was great, and long live his boot, which was still greater! Ladies, take the advice of a friend; make a mistake in your neighbor if you see fit. The property of love is to err. A love affair is not made to crouch down and brutalize itself like an English serving-maid who has callouses on her knees from scrubbing. It is not made for that; it errs gayly, our gentle love. It has been said, error is human; I say, error is love. Ladies, I idolize you all. O Z√©phine, O Jos√©phine, face more than irregular, you would be charming were you not all askew. You have the air of a pretty face upon which some one has sat down by mistake. As for Favourite, O nymph
U||s and muses! one day when Blachevelle was crossing the gutter in the Rue Gu√©rin-Boisseau, he espied a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up, which displayed her legs. This prologue pleased him, and Blachevelle fell in love. The one he loved was Favourite. O Favourite, thou hast Ionian lips. There was a Greek painter named Euphorion, who was surnamed the painter of the lips. That Greek alone would have been worthy to paint thy mouth. Listen! before thee, there was never a creature worthy of the name. Thou wert made to receive the apple like Venus, or to eat it like Eve; beauty begins with thee. I have just referred to Eve; it is thou who hast created her. Thou deservest the letters-patent of the beautiful woman. O Favourite, I cease to address you as ‚Äòthou,‚Äô because I pass from poetry to prose. You were speaking of my name a little while ago. That touched me; but let us, whoever we may be, distrust names. They may delude us. I am called F√©lix, and I am not happy. Words are liars. Let us not 
U||blindly accept the indications which they afford us. It would be a mistake to write to Li√®ge 2 for corks, and to Pau for gloves. Miss Dahlia, were I in your place, I would call myself Rosa. A flower should smell sweet, and woman should have wit. I say nothing of Fantine; she is a dreamer, a musing, thoughtful, pensive person; she is a phantom possessed of the form of a nymph and the modesty of a nun, who has strayed into the life of a grisette, but who takes refuge in illusions, and who sings and prays and gazes into the azure without very well knowing what she sees or what she is doing, and who, with her eyes fixed on heaven, wanders in a garden where there are more birds than are in existence. O Fantine, know this: I, Tholomy√®s, I am an illusion; but she does not even hear me, that blond maid of Chimeras! as for the rest, everything about her is freshness, suavity, youth, sweet morning light. O Fantine, maid worthy of being called Marguerite or Pearl, you are a woman from the beauteous Orient. Ladies, a 
U||second piece of advice: do not marry; marriage is a graft; it takes well or ill; avoid that risk. But bah! what am I saying? I am wasting my words. Girls are incurable on the subject of marriage, and all that we wise men can say will not prevent the waistcoat-makers and the shoe-stitchers from dreaming of husbands studded with diamonds. Well, so be it; but, my beauties, remember this, you eat too much sugar. You have but one fault, O woman, and that is nibbling sugar. O nibbling sex, your pretty little white teeth adore sugar. Now, heed me well, sugar is a salt. All salts are withering. Sugar is the most desiccating of all salts; it sucks the liquids of the blood through the veins; hence the coagulation, and then the solidification of the blood; hence tubercles in the lungs, hence death. That is why diabetes borders on consumption. Then, do not crunch sugar, and you will live. I turn to the men: gentlemen, make conquest, rob each other of your well-beloved without remorse. Chassez across. In love there are n
U||o friends. Everywhere where there is a pretty woman hostility is open. No quarter, war to the death! a pretty woman is a casus belli; a pretty woman is flagrant misdemeanor. All the invasions of history have been determined by petticoats. Woman is man‚Äôs right. Romulus carried off the Sabines; William carried off the Saxon women; C√¶sar carried off the Roman women. The man who is not loved soars like a vulture over the mistresses of other men; and for my own part, to all those unfortunate men who are widowers, I throw the sublime proclamation of Bonaparte to the army of Italy: ‚ÄúSoldiers, you are in need of everything; the enemy has it.‚Äù
U||Tholomy√®s paused.
U||‚ÄúTake breath, Tholomy√®s,‚Äù said Blachevelle.
U||At the same moment Blachevelle, supported by Listolier and Fameuil, struck up to a plaintive air, one of those studio songs composed of the first words which come to hand, rhymed richly and not at all, as destitute of sense as the gesture of the tree and the sound of the wind, which have their birth in the vapor of pipes, and are dissipated and take their flight with them. This is the couplet by which the group replied to Tholomy√®s‚Äô harangue:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe father turkey-cocks so grave
U||Some money to an agent gave,
U||That master good Clermont-Tonnerre
U||Might be made pope on Saint Johns‚Äô day fair.
U||But this good Clermont could not be
U||Made pope, because no priest was he;
U||And then their agent, whose wrath burned,
U||With all their money back returned.‚Äù
U||This was not calculated to calm Tholomy√®s‚Äô improvisation; he emptied his glass, filled, refilled it, and began again:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDown with wisdom! Forget all that I have said. Let us be neither prudes nor prudent men nor prudhommes. I propose a toast to mirth; be merry. Let us complete our course of law by folly and eating! Indigestion and the digest. Let Justinian be the male, and Feasting, the female! Joy in the depths! Live, O creation! The world is a great diamond. I am happy. The birds are astonishing. What a festival everywhere! The nightingale is a gratuitous Elleviou. Summer, I salute thee! O Luxembourg! O Georgics of the Rue Madame, and of the All√©e de l‚ÄôObservatoire! O pensive infantry soldiers! O all those charming nurses who, while they guard the children, amuse themselves! The pampas of America would please me if I had not the arcades of the Od√©on. My soul flits away into the virgin forests and to the savannas. All is beautiful. The flies buzz in the sun. The sun has sneezed out the humming bird. Embrace me, Fantine!‚Äù
U||He made a mistake and embraced Favourite.
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîTHE DEATH OF A HORSE
U||‚ÄúThe dinners are better at √âdon‚Äôs than at Bombarda‚Äôs,‚Äù exclaimed Z√©phine.
U||‚ÄúI prefer Bombarda to √âdon,‚Äù declared Blachevelle. ‚ÄúThere is more luxury. It is more Asiatic. Look at the room downstairs; there are mirrors [glaces] on the walls.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI prefer them [glaces, ices] on my plate,‚Äù said Favourite.
U||Blachevelle persisted:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLook at the knives. The handles are of silver at Bombarda‚Äôs and of bone at √âdon‚Äôs. Now, silver is more valuable than bone.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúExcept for those who have a silver chin,‚Äù observed Tholomy√®s.
U||He was looking at the dome of the Invalides, which was visible from Bombarda‚Äôs windows.
U||A pause ensued.
U||‚ÄúTholomy√®s,‚Äù exclaimed Fameuil, ‚ÄúListolier and I were having a discussion just now.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA discussion is a good thing,‚Äù replied Tholomy√®s; ‚Äúa quarrel is better.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWe were disputing about philosophy.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhich do you prefer, Descartes or Spinoza?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúD√©saugiers,‚Äù said Tholomy√®s.
U||This decree pronounced, he took a drink, and went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI consent to live. All is not at an end on earth since we can still talk nonsense. For that I return thanks to the immortal gods. We lie. One lies, but one laughs. One affirms, but one doubts. The unexpected bursts forth from the syllogism. That is fine. There are still human beings here below who know how to open and close the surprise box of the paradox merrily. This, ladies, which you are drinking with so tranquil an air is Madeira wine, you must know, from the vineyard of Coural das Freiras, which is three hundred and seventeen fathoms above the level of the sea. Attention while you drink! three hundred and seventeen fathoms! and Monsieur Bombarda, the magnificent eating-house keeper, gives you those three hundred and seventeen fathoms for four francs and fifty centimes.‚Äù
U||Again Fameuil interrupted him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúTholomy√®s, your opinions fix the law. Who is your favorite author?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBer‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúQuin?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo; Choux.‚Äù
U||And Tholomy√®s continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHonor to Bombarda! He would equal Munophis of Elephanta if he could but get me an Indian dancing-girl, and Thygelion of Ch√¶ronea if he could bring me a Greek courtesan; for, oh, ladies! there were Bombardas in Greece and in Egypt. Apuleius tells us of them. Alas! always the same, and nothing new; nothing more unpublished by the creator in creation! Nil sub sole novum, says Solomon; amor omnibus idem, says Virgil; and Carabine mounts with Carabin into the bark at Saint-Cloud, as Aspasia embarked with Pericles upon the fleet at Samos. One last word. Do you know what Aspasia was, ladies? Although she lived at an epoch when women had, as yet, no soul, she was a soul; a soul of a rosy and purple hue, more ardent hued than fire, fresher than the dawn. Aspasia was a creature in whom two extremes of womanhood met; she was the goddess prostitute; Socrates plus Manon Lescaut. Aspasia was created in case a mistress should be needed for Prometheus.‚Äù
U||Tholomy√®s, once started, would have found some difficulty in stopping, had not a horse fallen down upon the quay just at that moment. The shock caused the cart and the orator to come to a dead halt. It was a Beauceron mare, old and thin, and one fit for the knacker, which was dragging a very heavy cart. On arriving in front of Bombarda‚Äôs, the worn-out, exhausted beast had refused to proceed any further. This incident attracted a crowd. Hardly had the cursing and indignant carter had time to utter with proper energy the sacramental word, M√¢tin (the jade), backed up with a pitiless cut of the whip, when the jade fell, never to rise again. On hearing the hubbub made by the passers-by, Tholomy√®s‚Äô merry auditors turned their heads, and Tholomy√®s took advantage of the opportunity to bring his allocution to a close with this melancholy strophe:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúElle √©tait de ce monde ou coucous et carrosses
U||    Ont le m√™me destin;
U||Et, rosse, elle a v√©cu ce que vivant les rosses,
U||    L‚Äôespace d‚Äôun m√¢tin!‚Äù 3
U||‚ÄúPoor horse!‚Äù sighed Fantine.
U||And Dahlia exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThere is Fantine on the point of crying over horses. How can one be such a pitiful fool as that!‚Äù
U||At that moment Favourite, folding her arms and throwing her head back, looked resolutely at Tholomy√®s and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCome, now! the surprise?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúExactly. The moment has arrived,‚Äù replied Tholomy√®s. ‚ÄúGentlemen, the hour for giving these ladies a surprise has struck. Wait for us a moment, ladies.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt begins with a kiss,‚Äù said Blachevelle.
U||‚ÄúOn the brow,‚Äù added Tholomy√®s.
U||Each gravely bestowed a kiss on his mistress‚Äôs brow; then all four filed out through the door, with their fingers on their lips.
U||Favourite clapped her hands on their departure.
U||‚ÄúIt is beginning to be amusing already,‚Äù said she.
U||‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be too long,‚Äù murmured Fantine; ‚Äúwe are waiting for you.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER IX‚ÄîA MERRY END TO MIRTH
U||When the young girls were left alone, they leaned two by two on the window-sills, chatting, craning out their heads, and talking from one window to the other.
U||They saw the young men emerge from the Caf√© Bombarda arm in arm. The latter turned round, made signs to them, smiled, and disappeared in that dusty Sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into the Champs-√âlys√©es.
U||‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be long!‚Äù cried Fantine.
U||‚ÄúWhat are they going to bring us?‚Äù said Z√©phine.
U||‚ÄúIt will certainly be something pretty,‚Äù said Dahlia.
U||‚ÄúFor my part,‚Äù said Favourite, ‚ÄúI want it to be of gold.‚Äù
U||Their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of the lake, which they could see through the branches of the large trees, and which diverted them greatly.
U||It was the hour for the departure of the mail-coaches and diligences. Nearly all the stage-coaches for the south and west passed through the Champs-√âlys√©es. The majority followed the quay and went through the Passy Barrier. From moment to moment, some huge vehicle, painted yellow and black, heavily loaded, noisily harnessed, rendered shapeless by trunks, tarpaulins, and valises, full of heads which immediately disappeared, rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge, with dust for smoke, and an air of fury, grinding the pavements, changing all the paving-stones into steels. This uproar delighted the young girls. Favourite exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat a row! One would say that it was a pile of chains flying away.‚Äù
U||It chanced that one of these vehicles, which they could only see with difficulty through the thick elms, halted for a moment, then set out again at a gallop. This surprised Fantine.
U||‚ÄúThat‚Äôs odd!‚Äù said she. ‚ÄúI thought the diligence never stopped.‚Äù
U||Favourite shrugged her shoulders.
U||‚ÄúThis Fantine is surprising. I am coming to take a look at her out of curiosity. She is dazzled by the simplest things. Suppose a case: I am a traveller; I say to the diligence, ‚ÄòI will go on in advance; you shall pick me up on the quay as you pass.‚Äô The diligence passes, sees me, halts, and takes me. That is done every day. You do not know life, my dear.‚Äù
U||In this manner a certain time elapsed. All at once Favourite made a movement, like a person who is just waking up.
U||‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúand the surprise?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, by the way,‚Äù joined in Dahlia, ‚Äúthe famous surprise?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThey are a very long time about it!‚Äù said Fantine.
U||As Fantine concluded this sigh, the waiter who had served them at dinner entered. He held in his hand something which resembled a letter.
U||‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù demanded Favourite.
U||The waiter replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy did you not bring it at once?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBecause,‚Äù said the waiter, ‚Äúthe gentlemen ordered me not to deliver it to the ladies for an hour.‚Äù
U||Favourite snatched the paper from the waiter‚Äôs hand. It was, in fact, a letter.
U||‚ÄúStop!‚Äù said she; ‚Äúthere is no address; but this is what is written on it‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTHIS IS THE SURPRISE.‚Äù
U||She tore the letter open hastily, opened it, and read [she knew how to read]:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúOUR BELOVED:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou must know that we have parents. Parents‚Äîyou do not know much about such things. They are called fathers and mothers by the civil code, which is puerile and honest. Now, these parents groan, these old folks implore us, these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons; they desire our return, and offer to kill calves for us. Being virtuous, we obey them. At the hour when you read this, five fiery horses will be bearing us to our papas and mammas. We are pulling up our stakes, as Bossuet says. We are going; we are gone. We flee in the arms of Laffitte and on the wings of Caillard. The Toulouse diligence tears us from the abyss, and the abyss is you, O our little beauties! We return to society, to duty, to respectability, at full trot, at the rate of three leagues an hour. It is necessary for the good of the country that we should be, like the rest of the world, prefects, fathers of families, rural police, and councillors of state. Venerate us. We are sacrificing ourselves. Mourn for us in hast
U||e, and replace us with speed. If this letter lacerates you, do the same by it. Adieu.
U||    ‚ÄúFor the space of nearly two years we have made you happy. We bear you no grudge for that.
U||‚ÄúSigned:        
U||BLACHEVELLE.
U||FAMUEIL.
U||LISTOLIER.
U||F√âLIX THOLOMY√àS.
U||‚ÄúPostscriptum. The dinner is paid for.‚Äù
U||The four young women looked at each other.
U||Favourite was the first to break the silence.
U||‚ÄúWell!‚Äù she exclaimed, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a very pretty farce, all the same.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt is very droll,‚Äù said Z√©phine.
U||‚ÄúThat must have been Blachevelle‚Äôs idea,‚Äù resumed Favourite. ‚ÄúIt makes me in love with him. No sooner is he gone than he is loved. This is an adventure, indeed.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Dahlia; ‚Äúit was one of Tholomy√®s‚Äô ideas. That is evident.
U||‚ÄúIn that case,‚Äù retorted Favourite, ‚Äúdeath to Blachevelle, and long live Tholomy√®s!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúLong live Tholomy√®s!‚Äù exclaimed Dahlia and Z√©phine.
U||And they burst out laughing.
U||Fantine laughed with the rest.
U||An hour later, when she had returned to her room, she wept. It was her first love affair, as we have said; she had given herself to this Tholomy√®s as to a husband, and the poor girl had a child.
U||BOOK FOURTH‚ÄîTO CONFIDE IS SOMETIMES TO DELIVER INTO A PERSON‚ÄôS POWER
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîONE MOTHER MEETS ANOTHER MOTHER
U||There was, at Montfermeil, near Paris, during the first quarter of this century, a sort of cook-shop which no longer exists. This cook-shop was kept by some people named Th√©nardier, husband and wife. It was situated in Boulanger Lane. Over the door there was a board nailed flat against the wall. Upon this board was painted something which resembled a man carrying another man on his back, the latter wearing the big gilt epaulettes of a general, with large silver stars; red spots represented blood; the rest of the picture consisted of smoke, and probably represented a battle. Below ran this inscription: AT THE SIGN OF SERGEANT OF WATERLOO (Au Sargent de Waterloo).
U||Nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a hostelry. Nevertheless, the vehicle, or, to speak more accurately, the fragment of a vehicle, which encumbered the street in front of the cook-shop of the Sergeant of Waterloo, one evening in the spring of 1818, would certainly have attracted, by its mass, the attention of any painter who had passed that way.
U||It was the fore-carriage of one of those trucks which are used in wooded tracts of country, and which serve to transport thick planks and the trunks of trees. This fore-carriage was composed of a massive iron axle-tree with a pivot, into which was fitted a heavy shaft, and which was supported by two huge wheels. The whole thing was compact, overwhelming, and misshapen. It seemed like the gun-carriage of an enormous cannon. The ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels, the fellies, the hub, the axle, and the shaft, a layer of mud, a hideous yellowish daubing hue, tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornamenting cathedrals. The wood was disappearing under mud, and the iron beneath rust. Under the axle-tree hung, like drapery, a huge chain, worthy of some Goliath of a convict. This chain suggested, not the beams, which it was its office to transport, but the mastodons and mammoths which it might have served to harness; it had the air of the galleys, but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys, and i
U||t seemed to have been detached from some monster. Homer would have bound Polyphemus with it, and Shakespeare, Caliban.
U||Why was that fore-carriage of a truck in that place in the street? In the first place, to encumber the street; next, in order that it might finish the process of rusting. There is a throng of institutions in the old social order, which one comes across in this fashion as one walks about outdoors, and which have no other reasons for existence than the above.
U||The centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle, and in the loop, as in the rope of a swing, there were seated and grouped, on that particular evening, in exquisite interlacement, two little girls; one about two years and a half old, the other, eighteen months; the younger in the arms of the other. A handkerchief, cleverly knotted about them, prevented their falling out. A mother had caught sight of that frightful chain, and had said, ‚ÄúCome! there‚Äôs a plaything for my children.‚Äù
U||The two children, who were dressed prettily and with some elegance, were radiant with pleasure; one would have said that they were two roses amid old iron; their eyes were a triumph; their fresh cheeks were full of laughter. One had chestnut hair; the other, brown. Their innocent faces were two delighted surprises; a blossoming shrub which grew near wafted to the passers-by perfumes which seemed to emanate from them; the child of eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood. Above and around these two delicate heads, all made of happiness and steeped in light, the gigantic fore-carriage, black with rust, almost terrible, all entangled in curves and wild angles, rose in a vault, like the entrance of a cavern. A few paces apart, crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry, the mother, not a very prepossessing woman, by the way, though touching at that moment, was swinging the two children by means of a long cord, watching them carefully, for fear of acci
U||dents, with that animal and celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity. At every backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound, which resembled a cry of rage; the little girls were in ecstasies; the setting sun mingled in this joy, and nothing could be more charming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of Titans the swing of cherubim.
U||As she rocked her little ones, the mother hummed in a discordant voice a romance then celebrated:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt must be, said a warrior.‚Äù
U||Her song, and the contemplation of her daughters, prevented her hearing and seeing what was going on in the street.
U||In the meantime, some one had approached her, as she was beginning the first couplet of the romance, and suddenly she heard a voice saying very near her ear:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou have two beautiful children there, Madame.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo the fair and tender Imogene‚Äî‚Äù
U||replied the mother, continuing her romance; then she turned her head.
U||A woman stood before her, a few paces distant. This woman also had a child, which she carried in her arms.
U||She was carrying, in addition, a large carpet-bag, which seemed very heavy.
U||This woman‚Äôs child was one of the most divine creatures that it is possible to behold. It was a girl, two or three years of age. She could have entered into competition with the two other little ones, so far as the coquetry of her dress was concerned; she wore a cap of fine linen, ribbons on her bodice, and Valenciennes lace on her cap. The folds of her skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white, firm, and dimpled leg. She was admirably rosy and healthy. The little beauty inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks. Of her eyes nothing could be known, except that they must be very large, and that they had magnificent lashes. She was asleep.
U||She slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her age. The arms of mothers are made of tenderness; in them children sleep profoundly.
U||As for the mother, her appearance was sad and poverty-stricken. She was dressed like a working-woman who is inclined to turn into a peasant again. She was young. Was she handsome? Perhaps; but in that attire it was not apparent. Her hair, a golden lock of which had escaped, seemed very thick, but was severely concealed beneath an ugly, tight, close, nun-like cap, tied under the chin. A smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them; but she did not smile. Her eyes did not seem to have been dry for a very long time. She was pale; she had a very weary and rather sickly appearance. She gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child. A large blue handkerchief, such as the Invalides use, was folded into a fichu, and concealed her figure clumsily. Her hands were sunburnt and all dotted with freckles, her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle; she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff, a linen gown, and coarse shoes. It was Fantine.
U||It was Fantine, but difficult to recognize. Nevertheless, on scrutinizing her attentively, it was evident that she still retained her beauty. A melancholy fold, which resembled the beginning of irony, wrinkled her right cheek. As for her toilette, that aerial toilette of muslin and ribbons, which seemed made of mirth, of folly, and of music, full of bells, and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautiful and dazzling hoar-frost which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight; it melts and leaves the branch quite black.
U||Ten months had elapsed since the ‚Äúpretty farce.‚Äù
U||What had taken place during those ten months? It can be divined.
U||After abandonment, straightened circumstances. Fantine had immediately lost sight of Favourite, Z√©phine and Dahlia; the bond once broken on the side of the men, it was loosed between the women; they would have been greatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later, that they had been friends; there no longer existed any reason for such a thing. Fantine had remained alone. The father of her child gone,‚Äîalas! such ruptures are irrevocable,‚Äîshe found herself absolutely isolated, minus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure. Drawn away by her liaison with Tholomy√®s to disdain the pretty trade which she knew, she had neglected to keep her market open; it was now closed to her. She had no resource. Fantine barely knew how to read, and did not know how to write; in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name; she had a public letter-writer indite an epistle to Tholomy√®s, then a second, then a third. Tholomy√®s replied to none of them. Fantine heard the gossips say, as they loo
U||ked at her child: ‚ÄúWho takes those children seriously! One only shrugs one‚Äôs shoulders over such children!‚Äù Then she thought of Tholomy√®s, who had shrugged his shoulders over his child, and who did not take that innocent being seriously; and her heart grew gloomy toward that man. But what was she to do? She no longer knew to whom to apply. She had committed a fault, but the foundation of her nature, as will be remembered, was modesty and virtue. She was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress, and of gliding into a worse state. Courage was necessary; she possessed it, and held herself firm. The idea of returning to her native town of M. sur M. occurred to her. There, some one might possibly know her and give her work; yes, but it would be necessary to conceal her fault. In a confused way she perceived the necessity of a separation which would be more painful than the first one. Her heart contracted, but she took her resolution. Fantine, as we shall see, had the fierce brav
U||ery of life. She had already valiantly renounced finery, had dressed herself in linen, and had put all her silks, all her ornaments, all her ribbons, and all her laces on her daughter, the only vanity which was left to her, and a holy one it was. She sold all that she had, which produced for her two hundred francs; her little debts paid, she had only about eighty francs left. At the age of twenty-two, on a beautiful spring morning, she quitted Paris, bearing her child on her back. Any one who had seen these two pass would have had pity on them. This woman had, in all the world, nothing but her child, and the child had, in all the world, no one but this woman. Fantine had nursed her child, and this had tired her chest, and she coughed a little.
U||We shall have no further occasion to speak of M. F√©lix Tholomy√®s. Let us confine ourselves to saying, that, twenty years later, under King Louis Philippe, he was a great provincial lawyer, wealthy and influential, a wise elector, and a very severe juryman; he was still a man of pleasure.
U||Towards the middle of the day, after having, from time to time, for the sake of resting herself, travelled, for three or four sous a league, in what was then known as the Petites Voitures des Environs de Paris, the ‚Äúlittle suburban coach service,‚Äù Fantine found herself at Montfermeil, in the alley Boulanger.
U||As she passed the Th√©nardier hostelry, the two little girls, blissful in the monster swing, had dazzled her in a manner, and she had halted in front of that vision of joy.
U||Charms exist. These two little girls were a charm to this mother.
U||She gazed at them in much emotion. The presence of angels is an announcement of Paradise. She thought that, above this inn, she beheld the mysterious HERE of Providence. These two little creatures were evidently happy. She gazed at them, she admired them, in such emotion that at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath between two couplets of her song, she could not refrain from addressing to her the remark which we have just read:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou have two pretty children, Madame.‚Äù
U||The most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on their young.
U||The mother raised her head and thanked her, and bade the wayfarer sit down on the bench at the door, she herself being seated on the threshold. The two women began to chat.
U||‚ÄúMy name is Madame Th√©nardier,‚Äù said the mother of the two little girls. ‚ÄúWe keep this inn.‚Äù
U||Then, her mind still running on her romance, she resumed humming between her teeth:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt must be so; I am a knight,
U||And I am off to Palestine.‚Äù
U||This Madame Th√©nardier was a sandy-complexioned woman, thin and angular‚Äîthe type of the soldier‚Äôs wife in all its unpleasantness; and what was odd, with a languishing air, which she owed to her perusal of romances. She was a simpering, but masculine creature. Old romances produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cook-shop woman. She was still young; she was barely thirty. If this crouching woman had stood upright, her lofty stature and her frame of a perambulating colossus suitable for fairs, might have frightened the traveller at the outset, troubled her confidence, and disturbed what caused what we have to relate to vanish. A person who is seated instead of standing erect‚Äîdestinies hang upon such a thing as that.
U||The traveller told her story, with slight modifications.
U||That she was a working-woman; that her husband was dead; that her work in Paris had failed her, and that she was on her way to seek it elsewhere, in her own native parts; that she had left Paris that morning on foot; that, as she was carrying her child, and felt fatigued, she had got into the Villemomble coach when she met it; that from Villemomble she had come to Montfermeil on foot; that the little one had walked a little, but not much, because she was so young, and that she had been obliged to take her up, and the jewel had fallen asleep.
U||At this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss, which woke her. The child opened her eyes, great blue eyes like her mother‚Äôs, and looked at‚Äîwhat? Nothing; with that serious and sometimes severe air of little children, which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in the presence of our twilight of virtue. One would say that they feel themselves to be angels, and that they know us to be men. Then the child began to laugh; and although the mother held fast to her, she slipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished to run. All at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing, stopped short, and put out her tongue, in sign of admiration.
U||Mother Th√©nardier released her daughters, made them descend from the swing, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúNow amuse yourselves, all three of you.‚Äù
U||Children become acquainted quickly at that age, and at the expiration of a minute the little Th√©nardiers were playing with the newcomer at making holes in the ground, which was an immense pleasure.
U||The newcomer was very gay; the goodness of the mother is written in the gayety of the child; she had seized a scrap of wood which served her for a shovel, and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly. The grave-digger‚Äôs business becomes a subject for laughter when performed by a child.
U||The two women pursued their chat.
U||‚ÄúWhat is your little one‚Äôs name?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCosette.‚Äù
U||For Cosette, read Euphrasie. The child‚Äôs name was Euphrasie. But out of Euphrasie the mother had made Cosette by that sweet and graceful instinct of mothers and of the populace which changes Josepha into Pepita, and Fran√ßoise into Sillette. It is a sort of derivative which disarranges and disconcerts the whole science of etymologists. We have known a grandmother who succeeded in turning Theodore into Gnon.
U||‚ÄúHow old is she?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe is going on three.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is the age of my eldest.‚Äù
U||In the meantime, the three little girls were grouped in an attitude of profound anxiety and blissfulness; an event had happened; a big worm had emerged from the ground, and they were afraid; and they were in ecstasies over it.
U||Their radiant brows touched each other; one would have said that there were three heads in one aureole.
U||‚ÄúHow easily children get acquainted at once!‚Äù exclaimed Mother Th√©nardier; ‚Äúone would swear that they were three sisters!‚Äù
U||This remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been waiting for. She seized the Th√©nardier‚Äôs hand, looked at her fixedly, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWill you keep my child for me?‚Äù
U||The Th√©nardier made one of those movements of surprise which signify neither assent nor refusal.
U||Cosette‚Äôs mother continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou see, I cannot take my daughter to the country. My work will not permit it. With a child one can find no situation. People are ridiculous in the country. It was the good God who caused me to pass your inn. When I caught sight of your little ones, so pretty, so clean, and so happy, it overwhelmed me. I said: ‚ÄòHere is a good mother. That is just the thing; that will make three sisters.‚Äô And then, it will not be long before I return. Will you keep my child for me?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI must see about it,‚Äù replied the Th√©nardier.
U||‚ÄúI will give you six francs a month.‚Äù
U||Here a man‚Äôs voice called from the depths of the cook-shop:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúNot for less than seven francs. And six months paid in advance.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSix times seven makes forty-two,‚Äù said the Th√©nardier.
U||‚ÄúI will give it,‚Äù said the mother.
U||‚ÄúAnd fifteen francs in addition for preliminary expenses,‚Äù added the man‚Äôs voice.
U||‚ÄúTotal, fifty-seven francs,‚Äù said Madame Th√©nardier. And she hummed vaguely, with these figures:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt must be, said a warrior.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will pay it,‚Äù said the mother. ‚ÄúI have eighty francs. I shall have enough left to reach the country, by travelling on foot. I shall earn money there, and as soon as I have a little I will return for my darling.‚Äù
U||The man‚Äôs voice resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe little one has an outfit?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is my husband,‚Äù said the Th√©nardier.
U||‚ÄúOf course she has an outfit, the poor treasure.‚ÄîI understood perfectly that it was your husband.‚ÄîAnd a beautiful outfit, too! a senseless outfit, everything by the dozen, and silk gowns like a lady. It is here, in my carpet-bag.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou must hand it over,‚Äù struck in the man‚Äôs voice again.
U||‚ÄúOf course I shall give it to you,‚Äù said the mother. ‚ÄúIt would be very queer if I were to leave my daughter quite naked!‚Äù
U||The master‚Äôs face appeared.
U||‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good,‚Äù said he.
U||The bargain was concluded. The mother passed the night at the inn, gave up her money and left her child, fastened her carpet-bag once more, now reduced in volume by the removal of the outfit, and light henceforth and set out on the following morning, intending to return soon. People arrange such departures tranquilly; but they are despairs!
U||A neighbor of the Th√©nardiers met this mother as she was setting out, and came back with the remark:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough to rend your heart.‚Äù
U||When Cosette‚Äôs mother had taken her departure, the man said to the woman:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat will serve to pay my note for one hundred and ten francs which falls due to-morrow; I lacked fifty francs. Do you know that I should have had a bailiff and a protest after me? You played the mouse-trap nicely with your young ones.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWithout suspecting it,‚Äù said the woman.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîFIRST SKETCH OF TWO UNPREPOSSESSING FIGURES
U||The mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen; but the cat rejoices even over a lean mouse.
U||Who were these Th√©nardiers?
U||Let us say a word or two of them now. We will complete the sketch later on.
U||These beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people who have been successful, and of intelligent people who have descended in the scale, which is between the class called ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù and the class denominated as ‚Äúinferior,‚Äù and which combines some of the defects of the second with nearly all the vices of the first, without possessing the generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of the bourgeois.
U||They were of those dwarfed natures which, if a dull fire chances to warm them up, easily become monstrous. There was in the woman a substratum of the brute, and in the man the material for a blackguard. Both were susceptible, in the highest degree, of the sort of hideous progress which is accomplished in the direction of evil. There exist crab-like souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness, retrograding in life rather than advancing, employing experience to augment their deformity, growing incessantly worse, and becoming more and more impregnated with an ever-augmenting blackness. This man and woman possessed such souls.
U||Th√©nardier, in particular, was troublesome for a physiognomist. One can only look at some men to distrust them; for one feels that they are dark in both directions. They are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front. There is something of the unknown about them. One can no more answer for what they have done than for what they will do. The shadow which they bear in their glance denounces them. From merely hearing them utter a word or seeing them make a gesture, one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future.
U||This Th√©nardier, if he himself was to be believed, had been a soldier‚Äîa sergeant, he said. He had probably been through the campaign of 1815, and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor, it would seem. We shall see later on how much truth there was in this. The sign of his hostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms. He had painted it himself; for he knew how to do a little of everything, and badly.
U||It was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, after having been Cl√©lie, was no longer anything but Lodo√Øska, still noble, but ever more and more vulgar, having fallen from Mademoiselle de Scud√©ri to Madame Bournon-Malarme, and from Madame de Lafayette to Madame Barth√©lemy-Hadot, was setting the loving hearts of the portresses of Paris aflame, and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent. Madame Th√©nardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books. She lived on them. In them she drowned what brains she possessed. This had given her, when very young, and even a little later, a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband, a scamp of a certain depth, a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar, coarse and fine at one and the same time, but, so far as sentimentalism was concerned, given to the perusal of Pigault-Lebrun, and ‚Äúin what concerns the sex,‚Äù as he said in his jargon‚Äîa downright, unmitigated lout. His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was. Later
U|| on, when her hair, arranged in a romantically drooping fashion, began to grow gray, when the Meg√¶ra began to be developed from the Pamela, the female Th√©nardier was nothing but a coarse, vicious woman, who had dabbled in stupid romances. Now, one cannot read nonsense with impunity. The result was that her eldest daughter was named √âponine; as for the younger, the poor little thing came near being called Gulnare; I know not to what diversion, effected by a romance of Ducray-Dumenil, she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of Azelma.
U||However, we will remark by the way, everything was not ridiculous and superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding, and which may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names. By the side of this romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social symptom. It is not rare for the neatherd‚Äôs boy nowadays to bear the name of Arthur, Alfred, or Alphonse, and for the vicomte‚Äîif there are still any vicomtes‚Äîto be called Thomas, Pierre, or Jacques. This displacement, which places the ‚Äúelegant‚Äù name on the plebeian and the rustic name on the aristocrat, is nothing else than an eddy of equality. The irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there as everywhere else. Beneath this apparent discord there is a great and a profound thing,‚Äîthe French Revolution.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîTHE LARK
U||It is not all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper. The cook-shop was in a bad way.
U||Thanks to the traveller‚Äôs fifty-seven francs, Th√©nardier had been able to avoid a protest and to honor his signature. On the following month they were again in need of money. The woman took Cosette‚Äôs outfit to Paris, and pawned it at the pawnbroker‚Äôs for sixty francs. As soon as that sum was spent, the Th√©nardiers grew accustomed to look on the little girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity; and they treated her accordingly. As she had no longer any clothes, they dressed her in the cast-off petticoats and chemises of the Th√©nardier brats; that is to say, in rags. They fed her on what all the rest had left‚Äîa little better than the dog, a little worse than the cat. Moreover, the cat and the dog were her habitual table-companions; Cosette ate with them under the table, from a wooden bowl similar to theirs.
U||The mother, who had established herself, as we shall see later on, at M. sur M., wrote, or, more correctly, caused to be written, a letter every month, that she might have news of her child. The Th√©nardiers replied invariably, ‚ÄúCosette is doing wonderfully well.‚Äù
U||At the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs for the seventh month, and continued her remittances with tolerable regularity from month to month. The year was not completed when Th√©nardier said: ‚ÄúA fine favor she is doing us, in sooth! What does she expect us to do with her seven francs?‚Äù and he wrote to demand twelve francs. The mother, whom they had persuaded into the belief that her child was happy, ‚Äúand was coming on well,‚Äù submitted, and forwarded the twelve francs.
U||Certain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on the other. Mother Th√©nardier loved her two daughters passionately, which caused her to hate the stranger.
U||It is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous aspects. Little as was the space occupied by Cosette, it seemed to her as though it were taken from her own, and that that little child diminished the air which her daughters breathed. This woman, like many women of her sort, had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and injuries to dispense each day. If she had not had Cosette, it is certain that her daughters, idolized as they were, would have received the whole of it; but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to herself. Her daughters received nothing but caresses. Cosette could not make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of violent blows and unmerited chastisement. The sweet, feeble being, who should not have understood anything of this world or of God, incessantly punished, scolded, ill-used, beaten, and seeing beside her two little creatures like herself, who lived in a ray of dawn!
U||Madame Th√©nardier was vicious with Cosette. √âponine and Azelma were vicious. Children at that age are only copies of their mother. The size is smaller; that is all.
U||A year passed; then another.
U||People in the village said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThose Th√©nardiers are good people. They are not rich, and yet they are bringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands!‚Äù
U||They thought that Cosette‚Äôs mother had forgotten her.
U||In the meanwhile, Th√©nardier, having learned, it is impossible to say by what obscure means, that the child was probably a bastard, and that the mother could not acknowledge it, exacted fifteen francs a month, saying that ‚Äúthe creature‚Äù was growing and ‚Äúeating,‚Äù and threatening to send her away. ‚ÄúLet her not bother me,‚Äù he exclaimed, ‚Äúor I‚Äôll fire her brat right into the middle of her secrets. I must have an increase.‚Äù The mother paid the fifteen francs.
U||From year to year the child grew, and so did her wretchedness.
U||As long as Cosette was little, she was the scape-goat of the two other children; as soon as she began to develop a little, that is to say, before she was even five years old, she became the servant of the household.
U||Five years old! the reader will say; that is not probable. Alas! it is true. Social suffering begins at all ages. Have we not recently seen the trial of a man named Dumollard, an orphan turned bandit, who, from the age of five, as the official documents state, being alone in the world, ‚Äúworked for his living and stole‚Äù?
U||Cosette was made to run on errands, to sweep the rooms, the courtyard, the street, to wash the dishes, to even carry burdens. The Th√©nardiers considered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner, since the mother, who was still at M. sur M., had become irregular in her payments. Some months she was in arrears.
U||If this mother had returned to Montfermeil at the end of these three years, she would not have recognized her child. Cosette, so pretty and rosy on her arrival in that house, was now thin and pale. She had an indescribably uneasy look. ‚ÄúThe sly creature,‚Äù said the Th√©nardiers.
U||Injustice had made her peevish, and misery had made her ugly. Nothing remained to her except her beautiful eyes, which inspired pain, because, large as they were, it seemed as though one beheld in them a still larger amount of sadness.
U||It was a heart-breaking thing to see this poor child, not yet six years old, shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen, full of holes, sweeping the street before daylight, with an enormous broom in her tiny red hands, and a tear in her great eyes.
U||Cossette Sweeping
U||She was called the Lark in the neighborhood. The populace, who are fond of these figures of speech, had taken a fancy to bestow this name on this trembling, frightened, and shivering little creature, no bigger than a bird, who was awake every morning before any one else in the house or the village, and was always in the street or the fields before daybreak.
U||Only the little lark never sang.
U||BOOK FIFTH‚ÄîTHE DESCENT
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîTHE HISTORY OF A PROGRESS IN BLACK GLASS TRINKETS
U||And in the meantime, what had become of that mother who according to the people at Montfermeil, seemed to have abandoned her child? Where was she? What was she doing?
U||After leaving her little Cosette with the Th√©nardiers, she had continued her journey, and had reached M. sur M.
U||This, it will be remembered, was in 1818.
U||Fantine had quitted her province ten years before. M. sur M. had changed its aspect. While Fantine had been slowly descending from wretchedness to wretchedness, her native town had prospered.
U||About two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the grand events of small districts had taken place.
U||This detail is important, and we regard it as useful to develop it at length; we should almost say, to underline it.
U||From time immemorial, M. sur M. had had for its special industry the imitation of English jet and the black glass trinkets of Germany. This industry had always vegetated, on account of the high price of the raw material, which reacted on the manufacture. At the moment when Fantine returned to M. sur M., an unheard-of transformation had taken place in the production of ‚Äúblack goods.‚Äù Towards the close of 1815 a man, a stranger, had established himself in the town, and had been inspired with the idea of substituting, in this manufacture, gum-lac for resin, and, for bracelets in particular, slides of sheet-iron simply laid together, for slides of soldered sheet-iron.
U||This very small change had effected a revolution.
U||This very small change had, in fact, prodigiously reduced the cost of the raw material, which had rendered it possible in the first place, to raise the price of manufacture, a benefit to the country; in the second place, to improve the workmanship, an advantage to the consumer; in the third place, to sell at a lower price, while trebling the profit, which was a benefit to the manufacturer.
U||Thus three results ensued from one idea.
U||In less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich, which is good, and had made every one about him rich, which is better. He was a stranger in the Department. Of his origin, nothing was known; of the beginning of his career, very little. It was rumored that he had come to town with very little money, a few hundred francs at the most.
U||It was from this slender capital, enlisted in the service of an ingenious idea, developed by method and thought, that he had drawn his own fortune, and the fortune of the whole countryside.
U||On his arrival at M. sur M. he had only the garments, the appearance, and the language of a workingman.
U||It appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into the little town of M. sur M., just at nightfall, on a December evening, knapsack on back and thorn club in hand, a large fire had broken out in the town-hall. This man had rushed into the flames and saved, at the risk of his own life, two children who belonged to the captain of the gendarmerie; this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport. Afterwards they had learned his name. He was called Father Madeleine.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîMADELEINE
U||He was a man about fifty years of age, who had a preoccupied air, and who was good. That was all that could be said about him.
U||Thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirably reconstructed, M. sur M. had become a rather important centre of trade. Spain, which consumes a good deal of black jet, made enormous purchases there each year. M. sur M. almost rivalled London and Berlin in this branch of commerce. Father Madeleine‚Äôs profits were such, that at the end of the second year he was able to erect a large factory, in which there were two vast workrooms, one for the men, and the other for women. Any one who was hungry could present himself there, and was sure of finding employment and bread. Father Madeleine required of the men good will, of the women pure morals, and of all, probity. He had separated the work-rooms in order to separate the sexes, and so that the women and girls might remain discreet. On this point he was inflexible. It was the only thing in which he was in a manner intolerant. He was all the more firmly set on this severity, since M. sur M., being a garrison town, opportunities for corruption
U|| abounded. However, his coming had been a boon, and his presence was a godsend. Before Father Madeleine‚Äôs arrival, everything had languished in the country; now everything lived with a healthy life of toil. A strong circulation warmed everything and penetrated everywhere. Slack seasons and wretchedness were unknown. There was no pocket so obscure that it had not a little money in it; no dwelling so lowly that there was not some little joy within it.
U||Father Madeleine gave employment to every one. He exacted but one thing: Be an honest man. Be an honest woman.
U||As we have said, in the midst of this activity of which he was the cause and the pivot, Father Madeleine made his fortune; but a singular thing in a simple man of business, it did not seem as though that were his chief care. He appeared to be thinking much of others, and little of himself. In 1820 he was known to have a sum of six hundred and thirty thousand francs lodged in his name with Laffitte; but before reserving these six hundred and thirty thousand francs, he had spent more than a million for the town and its poor.
U||The hospital was badly endowed; he founded six beds there. M. sur M. is divided into the upper and the lower town. The lower town, in which he lived, had but one school, a miserable hovel, which was falling to ruin: he constructed two, one for girls, the other for boys. He allotted a salary from his own funds to the two instructors, a salary twice as large as their meagre official salary, and one day he said to some one who expressed surprise, ‚ÄúThe two prime functionaries of the state are the nurse and the schoolmaster.‚Äù He created at his own expense an infant school, a thing then almost unknown in France, and a fund for aiding old and infirm workmen. As his factory was a centre, a new quarter, in which there were a good many indigent families, rose rapidly around him; he established there a free dispensary.
U||At first, when they watched his beginnings, the good souls said, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a jolly fellow who means to get rich.‚Äù When they saw him enriching the country before he enriched himself, the good souls said, ‚ÄúHe is an ambitious man.‚Äù This seemed all the more probable since the man was religious, and even practised his religion to a certain degree, a thing which was very favorably viewed at that epoch. He went regularly to low mass every Sunday. The local deputy, who nosed out all rivalry everywhere, soon began to grow uneasy over this religion. This deputy had been a member of the legislative body of the Empire, and shared the religious ideas of a father of the Oratoire, known under the name of Fouch√©, Duc d‚ÄôOtrante, whose creature and friend he had been. He indulged in gentle raillery at God with closed doors. But when he beheld the wealthy manufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seven o‚Äôclock, he perceived in him a possible candidate, and resolved to outdo him; he took a Jesuit confessor, and wen
U||t to high mass and to vespers. Ambition was at that time, in the direct acceptation of the word, a race to the steeple. The poor profited by this terror as well as the good God, for the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital, which made twelve.
U||Nevertheless, in 1819 a rumor one morning circulated through the town to the effect that, on the representations of the prefect and in consideration of the services rendered by him to the country, Father Madeleine was to be appointed by the King, mayor of M. sur M. Those who had pronounced this newcomer to be ‚Äúan ambitious fellow,‚Äù seized with delight on this opportunity which all men desire, to exclaim, ‚ÄúThere! what did we say!‚Äù All M. sur M. was in an uproar. The rumor was well founded. Several days later the appointment appeared in the Moniteur. On the following day Father Madeleine refused.
U||In this same year of 1819 the products of the new process invented by Madeleine figured in the industrial exhibition; when the jury made their report, the King appointed the inventor a chevalier of the Legion of Honor. A fresh excitement in the little town. Well, so it was the cross that he wanted! Father Madeleine refused the cross.
U||Decidedly this man was an enigma. The good souls got out of their predicament by saying, ‚ÄúAfter all, he is some sort of an adventurer.‚Äù
U||We have seen that the country owed much to him; the poor owed him everything; he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been obliged to honor and respect him. His workmen, in particular, adored him, and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity. When he was known to be rich, ‚Äúpeople in society‚Äù bowed to him, and he received invitations in the town; he was called, in town, Monsieur Madeleine; his workmen and the children continued to call him Father Madeleine, and that was what was most adapted to make him smile. In proportion as he mounted, throve, invitations rained down upon him. ‚ÄúSociety‚Äù claimed him for its own. The prim little drawing-rooms on M. sur M., which, of course, had at first been closed to the artisan, opened both leaves of their folding-doors to the millionnaire. They made a thousand advances to him. He refused.
U||This time the good gossips had no trouble. ‚ÄúHe is an ignorant man, of no education. No one knows where he came from. He would not know how to behave in society. It has not been absolutely proved that he knows how to read.‚Äù
U||When they saw him making money, they said, ‚ÄúHe is a man of business.‚Äù When they saw him scattering his money about, they said, ‚ÄúHe is an ambitious man.‚Äù When he was seen to decline honors, they said, ‚ÄúHe is an adventurer.‚Äù When they saw him repulse society, they said, ‚ÄúHe is a brute.‚Äù
U||In 1820, five years after his arrival in M. sur M., the services which he had rendered to the district were so dazzling, the opinion of the whole country round about was so unanimous, that the King again appointed him mayor of the town. He again declined; but the prefect resisted his refusal, all the notabilities of the place came to implore him, the people in the street besought him; the urging was so vigorous that he ended by accepting. It was noticed that the thing which seemed chiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe addressed to him by an old woman of the people, who called to him from her threshold, in an angry way: ‚ÄúA good mayor is a useful thing. Is he drawing back before the good which he can do?‚Äù
U||This was the third phase of his ascent. Father Madeleine had become Monsieur Madeleine. Monsieur Madeleine became Monsieur le Maire.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîSUMS DEPOSITED WITH LAFFITTE
U||On the other hand, he remained as simple as on the first day. He had gray hair, a serious eye, the sunburned complexion of a laborer, the thoughtful visage of a philosopher. He habitually wore a hat with a wide brim, and a long coat of coarse cloth, buttoned to the chin. He fulfilled his duties as mayor; but, with that exception, he lived in solitude. He spoke to but few people. He avoided polite attentions; he escaped quickly; he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity of talking; he gave, in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling. The women said of him, ‚ÄúWhat a good-natured bear!‚Äù His pleasure consisted in strolling in the fields.
U||He always took his meals alone, with an open book before him, which he read. He had a well-selected little library. He loved books; books are cold but safe friends. In proportion as leisure came to him with fortune, he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind. It had been observed that, ever since his arrival at M. sur M., his language had grown more polished, more choice, and more gentle with every passing year. He liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls, but he rarely made use of it. When he did happen to do so, his shooting was something so infallible as to inspire terror. He never killed an inoffensive animal. He never shot at a little bird.
U||Although he was no longer young, it was thought that he was still prodigiously strong. He offered his assistance to any one who was in need of it, lifted a horse, released a wheel clogged in the mud, or stopped a runaway bull by the horns. He always had his pockets full of money when he went out; but they were empty on his return. When he passed through a village, the ragged brats ran joyously after him, and surrounded him like a swarm of gnats.
U||It was thought that he must, in the past, have lived a country life, since he knew all sorts of useful secrets, which he taught to the peasants. He taught them how to destroy scurf on wheat, by sprinkling it and the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a solution of common salt; and how to chase away weevils by hanging up orviot in bloom everywhere, on the walls and the ceilings, among the grass and in the houses.
U||He had ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù for exterminating from a field, blight, tares, foxtail, and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat. He defended a rabbit warren against rats, simply by the odor of a guinea-pig which he placed in it.
U||One day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling up nettles; he examined the plants, which were uprooted and already dried, and said: ‚ÄúThey are dead. Nevertheless, it would be a good thing to know how to make use of them. When the nettle is young, the leaf makes an excellent vegetable; when it is older, it has filaments and fibres like hemp and flax. Nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth. Chopped up, nettles are good for poultry; pounded, they are good for horned cattle. The seed of the nettle, mixed with fodder, gives gloss to the hair of animals; the root, mixed with salt, produces a beautiful yellow coloring-matter. Moreover, it is an excellent hay, which can be cut twice. And what is required for the nettle? A little soil, no care, no culture. Only the seed falls as it is ripe, and it is difficult to collect it. That is all. With the exercise of a little care, the nettle could be made useful; it is neglected and it becomes hurtful. It is exterminated. How many men resemble the nettle!‚Äù H
U||e added, after a pause: ‚ÄúRemember this, my friends: there are no such things as bad plants or bad men. There are only bad cultivators.‚Äù
U||The children loved him because he knew how to make charming little trifles of straw and cocoanuts.
U||When he saw the door of a church hung in black, he entered: he sought out funerals as other men seek christenings. Widowhood and the grief of others attracted him, because of his great gentleness; he mingled with the friends clad in mourning, with families dressed in black, with the priests groaning around a coffin. He seemed to like to give to his thoughts for text these funereal psalmodies filled with the vision of the other world. With his eyes fixed on heaven, he listened with a sort of aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite, those sad voices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death.
U||He performed a multitude of good actions, concealing his agency in them as a man conceals himself because of evil actions. He penetrated houses privately, at night; he ascended staircases furtively. A poor wretch on returning to his attic would find that his door had been opened, sometimes even forced, during his absence. The poor man made a clamor over it: some malefactor had been there! He entered, and the first thing he beheld was a piece of gold lying forgotten on some piece of furniture. The ‚Äúmalefactor‚Äù who had been there was Father Madeleine.
U||He was affable and sad. The people said: ‚ÄúThere is a rich man who has not a haughty air. There is a happy man who has not a contented air.‚Äù
U||Some people maintained that he was a mysterious person, and that no one ever entered his chamber, which was a regular anchorite‚Äôs cell, furnished with winged hour-glasses and enlivened by cross-bones and skulls of dead men! This was much talked of, so that one of the elegant and malicious young women of M. sur M. came to him one day, and asked: ‚ÄúMonsieur le Maire, pray show us your chamber. It is said to be a grotto.‚Äù He smiled, and introduced them instantly into this ‚Äúgrotto.‚Äù They were well punished for their curiosity. The room was very simply furnished in mahogany, which was rather ugly, like all furniture of that sort, and hung with paper worth twelve sous. They could see nothing remarkable about it, except two candlesticks of antique pattern which stood on the chimney-piece and appeared to be silver, ‚Äúfor they were hall-marked,‚Äù an observation full of the type of wit of petty towns.
U||Nevertheless, people continued to say that no one ever got into the room, and that it was a hermit‚Äôs cave, a mysterious retreat, a hole, a tomb.
U||It was also whispered about that he had ‚Äúimmense‚Äù sums deposited with Laffitte, with this peculiar feature, that they were always at his immediate disposal, so that, it was added, M. Madeleine could make his appearance at Laffitte‚Äôs any morning, sign a receipt, and carry off his two or three millions in ten minutes. In reality, ‚Äúthese two or three millions‚Äù were reducible, as we have said, to six hundred and thirty or forty thousand francs.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîM. MADELEINE IN MOURNING
U||At the beginning of 1820 the newspapers announced the death of M. Myriel, Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî, surnamed ‚ÄúMonseigneur Bienvenu,‚Äù who had died in the odor of sanctity at the age of eighty-two.
U||The Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî to supply here a detail which the papers omitted‚Äîhad been blind for many years before his death, and content to be blind, as his sister was beside him.
U||Let us remark by the way, that to be blind and to be loved, is, in fact, one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth, where nothing is complete. To have continually at one‚Äôs side a woman, a daughter, a sister, a charming being, who is there because you need her and because she cannot do without you; to know that we are indispensable to a person who is necessary to us; to be able to incessantly measure one‚Äôs affection by the amount of her presence which she bestows on us, and to say to ourselves, ‚ÄúSince she consecrates the whole of her time to me, it is because I possess the whole of her heart‚Äù; to behold her thought in lieu of her face; to be able to verify the fidelity of one being amid the eclipse of the world; to regard the rustle of a gown as the sound of wings; to hear her come and go, retire, speak, return, sing, and to think that one is the centre of these steps, of this speech; to manifest at each instant one‚Äôs personal attraction; to feel one‚Äôs self all the mor
U||e powerful because of one‚Äôs infirmity; to become in one‚Äôs obscurity, and through one‚Äôs obscurity, the star around which this angel gravitates,‚Äîfew felicities equal this. The supreme happiness of life consists in the conviction that one is loved; loved for one‚Äôs own sake‚Äîlet us say rather, loved in spite of one‚Äôs self; this conviction the blind man possesses. To be served in distress is to be caressed. Does he lack anything? No. One does not lose the sight when one has love. And what love! A love wholly constituted of virtue! There is no blindness where there is certainty. Soul seeks soul, gropingly, and finds it. And this soul, found and tested, is a woman. A hand sustains you; it is hers: a mouth lightly touches your brow; it is her mouth: you hear a breath very near you; it is hers. To have everything of her, from her worship to her pity, never to be left, to have that sweet weakness aiding you, to lean upon that immovable reed, to touch Providence with one‚Äôs hands, and to be able to take i
U||t in one‚Äôs arms,‚ÄîGod made tangible,‚Äîwhat bliss! The heart, that obscure, celestial flower, undergoes a mysterious blossoming. One would not exchange that shadow for all brightness! The angel soul is there, uninterruptedly there; if she departs, it is but to return again; she vanishes like a dream, and reappears like reality. One feels warmth approaching, and behold! she is there. One overflows with serenity, with gayety, with ecstasy; one is a radiance amid the night. And there are a thousand little cares. Nothings, which are enormous in that void. The most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you, and supplying the vanished universe to you. One is caressed with the soul. One sees nothing, but one feels that one is adored. It is a paradise of shadows.
U||It was from this paradise that Monseigneur Welcome had passed to the other.
U||The announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of M. sur M. On the following day, M. Madeleine appeared clad wholly in black, and with crape on his hat.
U||This mourning was noticed in the town, and commented on. It seemed to throw a light on M. Madeleine‚Äôs origin. It was concluded that some relationship existed between him and the venerable Bishop. ‚ÄúHe has gone into mourning for the Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù said the drawing-rooms; this raised M. Madeleine‚Äôs credit greatly, and procured for him, instantly and at one blow, a certain consideration in the noble world of M. sur M. The microscopic Faubourg Saint-Germain of the place meditated raising the quarantine against M. Madeleine, the probable relative of a bishop. M. Madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained, by the more numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentiful smiles of the young ones. One evening, a ruler in that petty great world, who was curious by right of seniority, ventured to ask him, ‚ÄúM. le Maire is doubtless a cousin of the late Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî?‚Äù
U||He said, ‚ÄúNo, Madame.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut,‚Äù resumed the dowager, ‚Äúyou are wearing mourning for him.‚Äù
U||He replied, ‚ÄúIt is because I was a servant in his family in my youth.‚Äù
U||Another thing which was remarked, was, that every time that he encountered in the town a young Savoyard who was roaming about the country and seeking chimneys to sweep, the mayor had him summoned, inquired his name, and gave him money. The little Savoyards told each other about it: a great many of them passed that way.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîVAGUE FLASHES ON THE HORIZON
U||Little by little, and in the course of time, all this opposition subsided. There had at first been exercised against M. Madeleine, in virtue of a sort of law which all those who rise must submit to, blackening and calumnies; then they grew to be nothing more than ill-nature, then merely malicious remarks, then even this entirely disappeared; respect became complete, unanimous, cordial, and towards 1821 the moment arrived when the word ‚ÄúMonsieur le Maire‚Äù was pronounced at M. sur M. with almost the same accent as ‚ÄúMonseigneur the Bishop‚Äù had been pronounced in D‚Äî‚Äî in 1815. People came from a distance of ten leagues around to consult M. Madeleine. He put an end to differences, he prevented lawsuits, he reconciled enemies. Every one took him for the judge, and with good reason. It seemed as though he had for a soul the book of the natural law. It was like an epidemic of veneration, which in the course of six or seven years gradually took possession of the whole district.
U||One single man in the town, in the arrondissement, absolutely escaped this contagion, and, whatever Father Madeleine did, remained his opponent as though a sort of incorruptible and imperturbable instinct kept him on the alert and uneasy. It seems, in fact, as though there existed in certain men a veritable bestial instinct, though pure and upright, like all instincts, which creates antipathies and sympathies, which fatally separates one nature from another nature, which does not hesitate, which feels no disquiet, which does not hold its peace, and which never belies itself, clear in its obscurity, infallible, imperious, intractable, stubborn to all counsels of the intelligence and to all the dissolvents of reason, and which, in whatever manner destinies are arranged, secretly warns the man-dog of the presence of the man-cat, and the man-fox of the presence of the man-lion.
U||It frequently happened that when M. Madeleine was passing along a street, calm, affectionate, surrounded by the blessings of all, a man of lofty stature, clad in an iron-gray frock-coat, armed with a heavy cane, and wearing a battered hat, turned round abruptly behind him, and followed him with his eyes until he disappeared, with folded arms and a slow shake of the head, and his upper lip raised in company with his lower to his nose, a sort of significant grimace which might be translated by: ‚ÄúWhat is that man, after all? I certainly have seen him somewhere. In any case, I am not his dupe.‚Äù
U||This person, grave with a gravity which was almost menacing, was one of those men who, even when only seen by a rapid glimpse, arrest the spectator‚Äôs attention.
U||His name was Javert, and he belonged to the police.
U||At M. sur M. he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of an inspector. He had not seen Madeleine‚Äôs beginnings. Javert owed the post which he occupied to the protection of M. Chabouillet, the secretary of the Minister of State, Comte Angl√®s, then prefect of police at Paris. When Javert arrived at M. sur M. the fortune of the great manufacturer was already made, and Father Madeleine had become Monsieur Madeleine.
U||Certain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy, which is complicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority. Javert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness.
U||It is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes, we should be able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual of the human race corresponds to some one of the species of the animal creation; and we could easily recognize this truth, hardly perceived by the thinker, that from the oyster to the eagle, from the pig to the tiger, all animals exist in man, and that each one of them is in a man. Sometimes even several of them at a time.
U||Animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices, straying before our eyes, the visible phantoms of our souls. God shows them to us in order to induce us to reflect. Only since animals are mere shadows, God has not made them capable of education in the full sense of the word; what is the use? On the contrary, our souls being realities and having a goal which is appropriate to them, God has bestowed on them intelligence; that is to say, the possibility of education. Social education, when well done, can always draw from a soul, of whatever sort it may be, the utility which it contains.
U||This, be it said, is of course from the restricted point of view of the terrestrial life which is apparent, and without prejudging the profound question of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are not man. The visible I in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny the latent I. Having made this reservation, let us pass on.
U||Now, if the reader will admit, for a moment, with us, that in every man there is one of the animal species of creation, it will be easy for us to say what there was in Police Officer Javert.
U||The peasants of Asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolves there is one dog, which is killed by the mother because, otherwise, as he grew up, he would devour the other little ones.
U||Give to this dog-son of a wolf a human face, and the result will be Javert.
U||Javert had been born in prison, of a fortune-teller, whose husband was in the galleys. As he grew up, he thought that he was outside the pale of society, and he despaired of ever re-entering it. He observed that society unpardoningly excludes two classes of men,‚Äîthose who attack it and those who guard it; he had no choice except between these two classes; at the same time, he was conscious of an indescribable foundation of rigidity, regularity, and probity, complicated with an inexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung. He entered the police; he succeeded there. At forty years of age he was an inspector.
U||During his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments of the South.
U||Before proceeding further, let us come to an understanding as to the words, ‚Äúhuman face,‚Äù which we have just applied to Javert.
U||The human face of Javert consisted of a flat nose, with two deep nostrils, towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks. One felt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns for the first time. When Javert laughed,‚Äîand his laugh was rare and terrible,‚Äîhis thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth, but his gums, and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage fold, as on the muzzle of a wild beast. Javert, serious, was a watchdog; when he laughed, he was a tiger. As for the rest, he had very little skull and a great deal of jaw; his hair concealed his forehead and fell over his eyebrows; between his eyes there was a permanent, central frown, like an imprint of wrath; his gaze was obscure; his mouth pursed up and terrible; his air that of ferocious command.
U||This man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments, comparatively; but he rendered them almost bad, by dint of exaggerating them,‚Äîrespect for authority, hatred of rebellion; and in his eyes, murder, robbery, all crimes, are only forms of rebellion. He enveloped in a blind and profound faith every one who had a function in the state, from the prime minister to the rural policeman. He covered with scorn, aversion, and disgust every one who had once crossed the legal threshold of evil. He was absolute, and admitted no exceptions. On the one hand, he said, ‚ÄúThe functionary can make no mistake; the magistrate is never the wrong.‚Äù On the other hand, he said, ‚ÄúThese men are irremediably lost. Nothing good can come from them.‚Äù He fully shared the opinion of those extreme minds which attribute to human law I know not what power of making, or, if the reader will have it so, of authenticating, demons, and who place a Styx at the base of society. He was stoical, serious, austere; a melanchol
U||y dreamer, humble and haughty, like fanatics. His glance was like a gimlet, cold and piercing. His whole life hung on these two words: watchfulness and supervision. He had introduced a straight line into what is the most crooked thing in the world; he possessed the conscience of his usefulness, the religion of his functions, and he was a spy as other men are priests. Woe to the man who fell into his hands! He would have arrested his own father, if the latter had escaped from the galleys, and would have denounced his mother, if she had broken her ban. And he would have done it with that sort of inward satisfaction which is conferred by virtue. And, withal, a life of privation, isolation, abnegation, chastity, with never a diversion. It was implacable duty; the police understood, as the Spartans understood Sparta, a pitiless lying in wait, a ferocious honesty, a marble informer, Brutus in Vidocq.
U||Javert‚Äôs whole person was expressive of the man who spies and who withdraws himself from observation. The mystical school of Joseph de Maistre, which at that epoch seasoned with lofty cosmogony those things which were called the ultra newspapers, would not have failed to declare that Javert was a symbol. His brow was not visible; it disappeared beneath his hat: his eyes were not visible, since they were lost under his eyebrows: his chin was not visible, for it was plunged in his cravat: his hands were not visible; they were drawn up in his sleeves: and his cane was not visible; he carried it under his coat. But when the occasion presented itself, there was suddenly seen to emerge from all this shadow, as from an ambuscade, a narrow and angular forehead, a baleful glance, a threatening chin, enormous hands, and a monstrous cudgel.
U||In his leisure moments, which were far from frequent, he read, although he hated books; this caused him to be not wholly illiterate. This could be recognized by some emphasis in his speech.
U||As we have said, he had no vices. When he was pleased with himself, he permitted himself a pinch of snuff. Therein lay his connection with humanity.
U||The reader will have no difficulty in understanding that Javert was the terror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the Ministry of Justice designates under the rubric, Vagrants. The name of Javert routed them by its mere utterance; the face of Javert petrified them at sight.
U||Such was this formidable man.
U||Javert was like an eye constantly fixed on M. Madeleine. An eye full of suspicion and conjecture. M. Madeleine had finally perceived the fact; but it seemed to be of no importance to him. He did not even put a question to Javert; he neither sought nor avoided him; he bore that embarrassing and almost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it. He treated Javert with ease and courtesy, as he did all the rest of the world.
U||It was divined, from some words which escaped Javert, that he had secretly investigated, with that curiosity which belongs to the race, and into which there enters as much instinct as will, all the anterior traces which Father Madeleine might have left elsewhere. He seemed to know, and he sometimes said in covert words, that some one had gleaned certain information in a certain district about a family which had disappeared. Once he chanced to say, as he was talking to himself, ‚ÄúI think I have him!‚Äù Then he remained pensive for three days, and uttered not a word. It seemed that the thread which he thought he held had broken.
U||Moreover, and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the too absolute sense which certain words might present, there can be nothing really infallible in a human creature, and the peculiarity of instinct is that it can become confused, thrown off the track, and defeated. Otherwise, it would be superior to intelligence, and the beast would be found to be provided with a better light than man.
U||Javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalness and tranquillity of M. Madeleine.
U||One day, nevertheless, his strange manner appeared to produce an impression on M. Madeleine. It was on the following occasion.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîFATHER FAUCHELEVENT
U||One morning M. Madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of M. sur M.; he heard a noise, and saw a group some distance away. He approached. An old man named Father Fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart, his horse having tumbled down.
U||This Fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom M. Madeleine had at that time. When Madeleine arrived in the neighborhood, Fauchelevent, an ex-notary and a peasant who was almost educated, had a business which was beginning to be in a bad way. Fauchelevent had seen this simple workman grow rich, while he, a lawyer, was being ruined. This had filled him with jealousy, and he had done all he could, on every occasion, to injure Madeleine. Then bankruptcy had come; and as the old man had nothing left but a cart and a horse, and neither family nor children, he had turned carter.
U||The horse had two broken legs and could not rise. The old man was caught in the wheels. The fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the vehicle rested on his breast. The cart was quite heavily laden. Father Fauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner. They had tried, but in vain, to drag him out. An unmethodical effort, aid awkwardly given, a wrong shake, might kill him. It was impossible to disengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him. Javert, who had come up at the moment of the accident, had sent for a jack-screw.
U||M. Madeleine arrived. People stood aside respectfully.
U||‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù cried old Fauchelevent. ‚ÄúWho will be good and save the old man?‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine turned towards those present:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIs there a jack-screw to be had?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOne has been sent for,‚Äù answered the peasant.
U||‚ÄúHow long will it take to get it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThey have gone for the nearest, to Flachot‚Äôs place, where there is a farrier; but it makes no difference; it will take a good quarter of an hour.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA quarter of an hour!‚Äù exclaimed Madeleine.
U||It had rained on the preceding night; the soil was soaked.
U||The cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment, and crushing the old carter‚Äôs breast more and more. It was evident that his ribs would be broken in five minutes more.
U||‚ÄúIt is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour,‚Äù said Madeleine to the peasants, who were staring at him.
U||‚ÄúWe must!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut it will be too late then! Don‚Äôt you see that the cart is sinking?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúListen,‚Äù resumed Madeleine; ‚Äúthere is still room enough under the cart to allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back. Only half a minute, and the poor man can be taken out. Is there any one here who has stout loins and heart? There are five louis d‚Äôor to be earned!‚Äù
U||Not a man in the group stirred.
U||‚ÄúTen louis,‚Äù said Madeleine.
U||The persons present dropped their eyes. One of them muttered: ‚ÄúA man would need to be devilish strong. And then he runs the risk of getting crushed!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCome,‚Äù began Madeleine again, ‚Äútwenty louis.‚Äù
U||The same silence.
U||‚ÄúIt is not the will which is lacking,‚Äù said a voice.
U||M. Madeleine turned round, and recognized Javert. He had not noticed him on his arrival.
U||Javert went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt is strength. One would have to be a terrible man to do such a thing as lift a cart like that on his back.‚Äù
U||Then, gazing fixedly at M. Madeleine, he went on, emphasizing every word that he uttered:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Madeleine, I have never known but one man capable of doing what you ask.‚Äù
U||Madeleine shuddered.
U||Javert added, with an air of indifference, but without removing his eyes from Madeleine:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHe was a convict.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù said Madeleine.
U||‚ÄúIn the galleys at Toulon.‚Äù
U||Madeleine turned pale.
U||Meanwhile, the cart continued to sink slowly. Father Fauchelevent rattled in the throat, and shrieked:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am strangling! My ribs are breaking! a screw! something! Ah!‚Äù
U||Madeleine glanced about him.
U||‚ÄúIs there, then, no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the life of this poor old man?‚Äù
U||No one stirred. Javert resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw, and he was that convict.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh! It is crushing me!‚Äù cried the old man.
U||Madeleine raised his head, met Javert‚Äôs falcon eye still fixed upon him, looked at the motionless peasants, and smiled sadly. Then, without saying a word, he fell on his knees, and before the crowd had even had time to utter a cry, he was underneath the vehicle.
U||A terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued.
U||They beheld Madeleine, almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible weight, make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows together. They shouted to him, ‚ÄúFather Madeleine, come out!‚Äù Old Fauchelevent himself said to him, ‚ÄúMonsieur Madeleine, go away! You see that I am fated to die! Leave me! You will get yourself crushed also!‚Äù Madeleine made no reply.
U||All the spectators were panting. The wheels had continued to sink, and it had become almost impossible for Madeleine to make his way from under the vehicle.
U||Suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver, the cart rose slowly, the wheels half emerged from the ruts. They heard a stifled voice crying, ‚ÄúMake haste! Help!‚Äù It was Madeleine, who had just made a final effort.
U||They rushed forwards. The devotion of a single man had given force and courage to all. The cart was raised by twenty arms. Old Fauchelevent was saved.
U||Madeleine rose. He was pale, though dripping with perspiration. His clothes were torn and covered with mud. All wept. The old man kissed his knees and called him the good God. As for him, he bore upon his countenance an indescribable expression of happy and celestial suffering, and he fixed his tranquil eye on Javert, who was still staring at him.
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîFAUCHELEVENT BECOMES A GARDENER IN PARIS
U||Fauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall. Father Madeleine had him conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for his workmen in the factory building itself, and which was served by two sisters of charity. On the following morning the old man found a thousand-franc bank-note on his night-stand, with these words in Father Madeleine‚Äôs writing: ‚ÄúI purchase your horse and cart.‚Äù The cart was broken, and the horse was dead. Fauchelevent recovered, but his knee remained stiff. M. Madeleine, on the recommendation of the sisters of charity and of his priest, got the good man a place as gardener in a female convent in the Rue Saint-Antoine in Paris.
U||Some time afterwards, M. Madeleine was appointed mayor. The first time that Javert beheld M. Madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him authority over the town, he felt the sort of shudder which a watch-dog might experience on smelling a wolf in his master‚Äôs clothes. From that time forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could. When the requirements of the service imperatively demanded it, and he could not do otherwise than meet the mayor, he addressed him with profound respect.
U||This prosperity created at M. sur M. by Father Madeleine had, besides the visible signs which we have mentioned, another symptom which was nonetheless significant for not being visible. This never deceives. When the population suffers, when work is lacking, when there is no commerce, the tax-payer resists imposts through penury, he exhausts and oversteps his respite, and the state expends a great deal of money in the charges for compelling and collection. When work is abundant, when the country is rich and happy, the taxes are paid easily and cost the state nothing. It may be said, that there is one infallible thermometer of the public misery and riches,‚Äîthe cost of collecting the taxes. In the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had diminished three-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M., and this led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by M. de Vill√®le, then Minister of Finance.
U||Such was the condition of the country when Fantine returned thither. No one remembered her. Fortunately, the door of M. Madeleine‚Äôs factory was like the face of a friend. She presented herself there, and was admitted to the women‚Äôs workroom. The trade was entirely new to Fantine; she could not be very skilful at it, and she therefore earned but little by her day‚Äôs work; but it was sufficient; the problem was solved; she was earning her living.
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîMADAME VICTURNIEN EXPENDS THIRTY FRANCS ON MORALITY
U||When Fantine saw that she was making her living, she felt joyful for a moment. To live honestly by her own labor, what mercy from heaven! The taste for work had really returned to her. She bought a looking-glass, took pleasure in surveying in it her youth, her beautiful hair, her fine teeth; she forgot many things; she thought only of Cosette and of the possible future, and was almost happy. She hired a little room and furnished on credit on the strength of her future work‚Äîa lingering trace of her improvident ways. As she was not able to say that she was married she took good care, as we have seen, not to mention her little girl.
U||At first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Th√©nardiers promptly. As she only knew how to sign her name, she was obliged to write through a public letter-writer.
U||She wrote often, and this was noticed. It began to be said in an undertone, in the women‚Äôs workroom, that Fantine ‚Äúwrote letters‚Äù and that ‚Äúshe had ways about her.‚Äù
U||There is no one for spying on people‚Äôs actions like those who are not concerned in them. Why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall? Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail on Tuesday? Why does he always take the narrow streets? Why does Madame always descend from her hackney-coach before reaching her house? Why does she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper, when she has a ‚Äúwhole stationer‚Äôs shop full of it?‚Äù etc. There exist beings who, for the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas, which are, moreover, of no consequence whatever to them, spend more money, waste more time, take more trouble, than would be required for ten good actions, and that gratuitously, for their own pleasure, without receiving any other payment for their curiosity than curiosity. They will follow up such and such a man or woman for whole days; they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of the streets, under alley-way doors at night, in cold and rain; they will bribe erra
U||nd-porters, they will make the drivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy, buy a waiting-maid, suborn a porter. Why? For no reason. A pure passion for seeing, knowing, and penetrating into things. A pure itch for talking. And often these secrets once known, these mysteries made public, these enigmas illuminated by the light of day, bring on catastrophies, duels, failures, the ruin of families, and broken lives, to the great joy of those who have ‚Äúfound out everything,‚Äù without any interest in the matter, and by pure instinct. A sad thing.
U||Certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking. Their conversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of the anteroom, is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly; they need a great amount of combustibles; and their combustibles are furnished by their neighbors.
U||So Fantine was watched.
U||In addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white teeth.
U||It was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, in the midst of the rest, to wipe away a tear. These were the moments when she was thinking of her child; perhaps, also, of the man whom she had loved.
U||Breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task.
U||It was observed that she wrote twice a month at least, and that she paid the carriage on the letter. They managed to obtain the address: Monsieur, Monsieur Th√©nardier, inn-keeper at Montfermeil. The public writer, a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets, was made to talk in the wine-shop. In short, it was discovered that Fantine had a child. ‚ÄúShe must be a pretty sort of a woman.‚Äù An old gossip was found, who made the trip to Montfermeil, talked to the Th√©nardiers, and said on her return: ‚ÄúFor my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind. I have seen the child.‚Äù
U||The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, the guardian and door-keeper of every one‚Äôs virtue. Madame Victurnien was fifty-six, and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age. A quavering voice, a whimsical mind. This old dame had once been young‚Äîastonishing fact! In her youth, in ‚Äô93, she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap, and passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins. She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp, captious, almost venomous; all this in memory of her monk, whose widow she was, and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will. She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible. At the Restoration she had turned bigot, and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk. She had a small property, which she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community. She was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras. So this Madame Victurnien went to Montfermeil, and returned with t
U||he remark, ‚ÄúI have seen the child.‚Äù
U||All this took time. Fantine had been at the factory for more than a year, when, one morning, the superintendent of the workroom handed her fifty francs from the mayor, told her that she was no longer employed in the shop, and requested her, in the mayor‚Äôs name, to leave the neighborhood.
U||This was the very month when the Th√©nardiers, after having demanded twelve francs instead of six, had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve.
U||Fantine was overwhelmed. She could not leave the neighborhood; she was in debt for her rent and furniture. Fifty francs was not sufficient to cancel this debt. She stammered a few supplicating words. The superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant. Besides, Fantine was only a moderately good workwoman. Overcome with shame, even more than with despair, she quitted the shop, and returned to her room. So her fault was now known to every one.
U||She no longer felt strong enough to say a word. She was advised to see the mayor; she did not dare. The mayor had given her fifty francs because he was good, and had dismissed her because he was just. She bowed before the decision.
U||CHAPTER IX‚ÄîMADAME VICTURNIEN‚ÄôS SUCCESS
U||So the monk‚Äôs widow was good for something.
U||But M. Madeleine had heard nothing of all this. Life is full of just such combinations of events. M. Madeleine was in the habit of almost never entering the women‚Äôs workroom.
U||At the head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster, whom the priest had provided for him, and he had full confidence in this superintendent,‚Äîa truly respectable person, firm, equitable, upright, full of the charity which consists in giving, but not having in the same degree that charity which consists in understanding and in forgiving. M. Madeleine relied wholly on her. The best men are often obliged to delegate their authority. It was with this full power, and the conviction that she was doing right, that the superintendent had instituted the suit, judged, condemned, and executed Fantine.
U||As regards the fifty francs, she had given them from a fund which M. Madeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes, and for giving assistance to the workwomen, and of which she rendered no account.
U||Fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood; she went from house to house. No one would have her. She could not leave town. The second-hand dealer, to whom she was in debt for her furniture‚Äîand what furniture!‚Äîsaid to her, ‚ÄúIf you leave, I will have you arrested as a thief.‚Äù The householder, whom she owed for her rent, said to her, ‚ÄúYou are young and pretty; you can pay.‚Äù She divided the fifty francs between the landlord and the furniture-dealer, returned to the latter three-quarters of his goods, kept only necessaries, and found herself without work, without a trade, with nothing but her bed, and still about fifty francs in debt.
U||She began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison, and earned twelve sous a day. Her daughter cost her ten. It was at this point that she began to pay the Th√©nardiers irregularly.
U||However, the old woman who lighted her candle for her when she returned at night, taught her the art of living in misery. Back of living on little, there is the living on nothing. These are the two chambers; the first is dark, the second is black.
U||Fantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter; how to give up a bird which eats a half a farthing‚Äôs worth of millet every two days; how to make a coverlet of one‚Äôs petticoat, and a petticoat of one‚Äôs coverlet; how to save one‚Äôs candle, by taking one‚Äôs meals by the light of the opposite window. No one knows all that certain feeble creatures, who have grown old in privation and honesty, can get out of a sou. It ends by being a talent. Fantine acquired this sublime talent, and regained a little courage.
U||At this epoch she said to a neighbor, ‚ÄúBah! I say to myself, by only sleeping five hours, and working all the rest of the time at my sewing, I shall always manage to nearly earn my bread. And, then, when one is sad, one eats less. Well, sufferings, uneasiness, a little bread on one hand, trouble on the other,‚Äîall this will support me.‚Äù
U||It would have been a great happiness to have her little girl with her in this distress. She thought of having her come. But what then! Make her share her own destitution! And then, she was in debt to the Th√©nardiers! How could she pay them? And the journey! How pay for that?
U||The old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called the life of indigence, was a sainted spinster named Marguerite, who was pious with a true piety, poor and charitable towards the poor, and even towards the rich, knowing how to write just sufficiently to sign herself Marguerite, and believing in God, which is science.
U||There are many such virtuous people in this lower world; some day they will be in the world above. This life has a morrow.
U||At first, Fantine had been so ashamed that she had not dared to go out.
U||When she was in the street, she divined that people turned round behind her, and pointed at her; every one stared at her and no one greeted her; the cold and bitter scorn of the passers-by penetrated her very flesh and soul like a north wind.
U||It seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath the sarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns. In Paris, at least, no one knows you, and this obscurity is a garment. Oh! how she would have liked to betake herself to Paris! Impossible!
U||She was obliged to accustom herself to disrepute, as she had accustomed herself to indigence. Gradually she decided on her course. At the expiration of two or three months she shook off her shame, and began to go about as though there were nothing the matter. ‚ÄúIt is all the same to me,‚Äù she said.
U||She went and came, bearing her head well up, with a bitter smile, and was conscious that she was becoming brazen-faced.
U||Madame Victurnien sometimes saw her passing, from her window, noticed the distress of ‚Äúthat creature‚Äù who, ‚Äúthanks to her,‚Äù had been ‚Äúput back in her proper place,‚Äù and congratulated herself. The happiness of the evil-minded is black.
U||Excess of toil wore out Fantine, and the little dry cough which troubled her increased. She sometimes said to her neighbor, Marguerite, ‚ÄúJust feel how hot my hands are!‚Äù
U||Nevertheless, when she combed her beautiful hair in the morning with an old broken comb, and it flowed about her like floss silk, she experienced a moment of happy coquetry.
U||CHAPTER X‚ÄîRESULT OF THE SUCCESS
U||She had been dismissed towards the end of the winter; the summer passed, but winter came again. Short days, less work. Winter: no warmth, no light, no noonday, the evening joining on to the morning, fogs, twilight; the window is gray; it is impossible to see clearly at it. The sky is but a vent-hole. The whole day is a cavern. The sun has the air of a beggar. A frightful season! Winter changes the water of heaven and the heart of man into a stone. Her creditors harrassed her.
U||Fantine earned too little. Her debts had increased. The Th√©nardiers, who were not promptly paid, wrote to her constantly letters whose contents drove her to despair, and whose carriage ruined her. One day they wrote to her that her little Cosette was entirely naked in that cold weather, that she needed a woollen skirt, and that her mother must send at least ten francs for this. She received the letter, and crushed it in her hands all day long. That evening she went into a barber‚Äôs shop at the corner of the street, and pulled out her comb. Her admirable golden hair fell to her knees.
U||‚ÄúWhat splendid hair!‚Äù exclaimed the barber.
U||‚ÄúHow much will you give me for it?‚Äù said she.
U||‚ÄúTen francs.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCut it off.‚Äù
U||She purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the Th√©nardiers. This petticoat made the Th√©nardiers furious. It was the money that they wanted. They gave the petticoat to √âponine. The poor Lark continued to shiver.
U||Fantine thought: ‚ÄúMy child is no longer cold. I have clothed her with my hair.‚Äù She put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head, and in which she was still pretty.
U||Dark thoughts held possession of Fantine‚Äôs heart.
U||When she saw that she could no longer dress her hair, she began to hate every one about her. She had long shared the universal veneration for Father Madeleine; yet, by dint of repeating to herself that it was he who had discharged her, that he was the cause of her unhappiness, she came to hate him also, and most of all. When she passed the factory in working hours, when the workpeople were at the door, she affected to laugh and sing.
U||An old workwoman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashion said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a girl who will come to a bad end.‚Äù
U||She took a lover, the first who offered, a man whom she did not love, out of bravado and with rage in her heart. He was a miserable scamp, a sort of mendicant musician, a lazy beggar, who beat her, and who abandoned her as she had taken him, in disgust.
U||She adored her child.
U||The lower she descended, the darker everything grew about her, the more radiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart. She said, ‚ÄúWhen I get rich, I will have my Cosette with me;‚Äù and she laughed. Her cough did not leave her, and she had sweats on her back.
U||One day she received from the Th√©nardiers a letter couched in the following terms: ‚ÄúCosette is ill with a malady which is going the rounds of the neighborhood. A miliary fever, they call it. Expensive drugs are required. This is ruining us, and we can no longer pay for them. If you do not send us forty francs before the week is out, the little one will be dead.‚Äù
U||She burst out laughing, and said to her old neighbor: ‚ÄúAh! they are good! Forty francs! the idea! That makes two napoleons! Where do they think I am to get them? These peasants are stupid, truly.‚Äù
U||Nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read the letter once more. Then she descended the stairs and emerged, running and leaping and still laughing.
U||Some one met her and said to her, ‚ÄúWhat makes you so gay?‚Äù
U||She replied: ‚ÄúA fine piece of stupidity that some country people have written to me. They demand forty francs of me. So much for you, you peasants!‚Äù
U||As she crossed the square, she saw a great many people collected around a carriage of eccentric shape, upon the top of which stood a man dressed in red, who was holding forth. He was a quack dentist on his rounds, who was offering to the public full sets of teeth, opiates, powders and elixirs.
U||Fantine mingled in the group, and began to laugh with the rest at the harangue, which contained slang for the populace and jargon for respectable people. The tooth-puller espied the lovely, laughing girl, and suddenly exclaimed: ‚ÄúYou have beautiful teeth, you girl there, who are laughing; if you want to sell me your palettes, I will give you a gold napoleon apiece for them.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat are my palettes?‚Äù asked Fantine.
U||‚ÄúThe palettes,‚Äù replied the dental professor, ‚Äúare the front teeth, the two upper ones.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHow horrible!‚Äù exclaimed Fantine.
U||‚ÄúTwo napoleons!‚Äù grumbled a toothless old woman who was present. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a lucky girl!‚Äù
U||Fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse voice of the man shouting to her: ‚ÄúReflect, my beauty! two napoleons; they may prove of service. If your heart bids you, come this evening to the inn of the Tillac d‚ÄôArgent; you will find me there.‚Äù
U||Fantine returned home. She was furious, and related the occurrence to her good neighbor Marguerite: ‚ÄúCan you understand such a thing? Is he not an abominable man? How can they allow such people to go about the country! Pull out my two front teeth! Why, I should be horrible! My hair will grow again, but my teeth! Ah! what a monster of a man! I should prefer to throw myself head first on the pavement from the fifth story! He told me that he should be at the Tillac d‚ÄôArgent this evening.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd what did he offer?‚Äù asked Marguerite.
U||‚ÄúTwo napoleons.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat makes forty francs.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Fantine; ‚Äúthat makes forty francs.‚Äù
U||She remained thoughtful, and began her work. At the expiration of a quarter of an hour she left her sewing and went to read the Th√©nardiers‚Äô letter once more on the staircase.
U||On her return, she said to Marguerite, who was at work beside her:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat is a miliary fever? Do you know?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù answered the old spinster; ‚Äúit is a disease.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDoes it require many drugs?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOh! terrible drugs.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHow does one get it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt is a malady that one gets without knowing how.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThen it attacks children?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúChildren in particular.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDo people die of it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThey may,‚Äù said Marguerite.
U||Fantine left the room and went to read her letter once more on the staircase.
U||That evening she went out, and was seen to turn her steps in the direction of the Rue de Paris, where the inns are situated.
U||The next morning, when Marguerite entered Fantine‚Äôs room before daylight,‚Äîfor they always worked together, and in this manner used only one candle for the two,‚Äîshe found Fantine seated on her bed, pale and frozen. She had not lain down. Her cap had fallen on her knees. Her candle had burned all night, and was almost entirely consumed. Marguerite halted on the threshold, petrified at this tremendous wastefulness, and exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLord! the candle is all burned out! Something has happened.‚Äù
U||Then she looked at Fantine, who turned toward her her head bereft of its hair.
U||Fantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night.
U||‚ÄúJesus!‚Äù said Marguerite, ‚Äúwhat is the matter with you, Fantine?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù replied Fantine. ‚ÄúQuite the contrary. My child will not die of that frightful malady, for lack of succor. I am content.‚Äù
U||So saying, she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which were glittering on the table.
U||‚ÄúAh! Jesus God!‚Äù cried Marguerite. ‚ÄúWhy, it is a fortune! Where did you get those louis d‚Äôor?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI got them,‚Äù replied Fantine.
U||At the same time she smiled. The candle illuminated her countenance. It was a bloody smile. A reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips, and she had a black hole in her mouth.
U||The two teeth had been extracted.
U||She sent the forty francs to Montfermeil.
U||After all it was a ruse of the Th√©nardiers to obtain money. Cosette was not ill.
U||Fantine threw her mirror out of the window. She had long since quitted her cell on the second floor for an attic with only a latch to fasten it, next the roof; one of those attics whose extremity forms an angle with the floor, and knocks you on the head every instant. The poor occupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the end of his destiny, only by bending over more and more.
U||She had no longer a bed; a rag which she called her coverlet, a mattress on the floor, and a seatless chair still remained. A little rosebush which she had, had dried up, forgotten, in one corner. In the other corner was a butter-pot to hold water, which froze in winter, and in which the various levels of the water remained long marked by these circles of ice. She had lost her shame; she lost her coquetry. A final sign. She went out, with dirty caps. Whether from lack of time or from indifference, she no longer mended her linen. As the heels wore out, she dragged her stockings down into her shoes. This was evident from the perpendicular wrinkles. She patched her bodice, which was old and worn out, with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement. The people to whom she was indebted made ‚Äúscenes‚Äù and gave her no peace. She found them in the street, she found them again on her staircase. She passed many a night weeping and thinking. Her eyes were very bright, and she felt a steady pain in her sho
U||ulder towards the top of the left shoulder-blade. She coughed a great deal. She deeply hated Father Madeleine, but made no complaint. She sewed seventeen hours a day; but a contractor for the work of prisons, who made the prisoners work at a discount, suddenly made prices fall, which reduced the daily earnings of working-women to nine sous. Seventeen hours of toil, and nine sous a day! Her creditors were more pitiless than ever. The second-hand dealer, who had taken back nearly all his furniture, said to her incessantly, ‚ÄúWhen will you pay me, you hussy?‚Äù What did they want of her, good God! She felt that she was being hunted, and something of the wild beast developed in her. About the same time, Th√©nardier wrote to her that he had waited with decidedly too much amiability and that he must have a hundred francs at once; otherwise he would turn little Cosette out of doors, convalescent as she was from her heavy illness, into the cold and the streets, and that she might do what she liked with herself, and
U|| die if she chose. ‚ÄúA hundred francs,‚Äù thought Fantine. ‚ÄúBut in what trade can one earn a hundred sous a day?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCome!‚Äù said she, ‚Äúlet us sell what is left.‚Äù
U||The unfortunate girl became a woman of the town.
U||CHAPTER XI‚ÄîCHRISTUS NOS LIBERAVIT
U||What is this history of Fantine? It is society purchasing a slave.
U||From whom? From misery.
U||From hunger, cold, isolation, destitution. A dolorous bargain. A soul for a morsel of bread. Misery offers; society accepts.
U||The sacred law of Jesus Christ governs our civilization, but it does not, as yet, permeate it; it is said that slavery has disappeared from European civilization. This is a mistake. It still exists; but it weighs only upon the woman, and it is called prostitution.
U||It weighs upon the woman, that is to say, upon grace, weakness, beauty, maternity. This is not one of the least of man‚Äôs disgraces.
U||At the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached, nothing is left to Fantine of that which she had formerly been.
U||She has become marble in becoming mire. Whoever touches her feels cold. She passes; she endures you; she ignores you; she is the severe and dishonored figure. Life and the social order have said their last word for her. All has happened to her that will happen to her. She has felt everything, borne everything, experienced everything, suffered everything, lost everything, mourned everything. She is resigned, with that resignation which resembles indifference, as death resembles sleep. She no longer avoids anything. Let all the clouds fall upon her, and all the ocean sweep over her! What matters it to her? She is a sponge that is soaked.
U||At least, she believes it to be so; but it is an error to imagine that fate can be exhausted, and that one has reached the bottom of anything whatever.
U||Alas! What are all these fates, driven on pell-mell? Whither are they going? Why are they thus?
U||He who knows that sees the whole of the shadow.
U||He is alone. His name is God.
U||CHAPTER XII‚ÄîM. BAMATABOIS‚ÄôS INACTIVITY
U||There is in all small towns, and there was at M. sur M. in particular, a class of young men who nibble away an income of fifteen hundred francs with the same air with which their prototypes devour two hundred thousand francs a year in Paris. These are beings of the great neuter species: impotent men, parasites, cyphers, who have a little land, a little folly, a little wit; who would be rustics in a drawing-room, and who think themselves gentlemen in the dram-shop; who say, ‚ÄúMy fields, my peasants, my woods‚Äù; who hiss actresses at the theatre to prove that they are persons of taste; quarrel with the officers of the garrison to prove that they are men of war; hunt, smoke, yawn, drink, smell of tobacco, play billiards, stare at travellers as they descend from the diligence, live at the caf√©, dine at the inn, have a dog which eats the bones under the table, and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table; who stick at a sou, exaggerate the fashions, admire tragedy, despise women, wear out their old boots, c
U||opy London through Paris, and Paris through the medium of Pont-√†-Mousson, grow old as dullards, never work, serve no use, and do no great harm.
U||M. F√©lix Tholomy√®s, had he remained in his own province and never beheld Paris, would have been one of these men.
U||If they were richer, one would say, ‚ÄúThey are dandies;‚Äù if they were poorer, one would say, ‚ÄúThey are idlers.‚Äù They are simply men without employment. Among these unemployed there are bores, the bored, dreamers, and some knaves.
U||At that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar, a big cravat, a watch with trinkets, three vests of different colors, worn one on top of the other‚Äîthe red and blue inside; of a short-waisted olive coat, with a codfish tail, a double row of silver buttons set close to each other and running up to the shoulder; and a pair of trousers of a lighter shade of olive, ornamented on the two seams with an indefinite, but always uneven, number of lines, varying from one to eleven‚Äîa limit which was never exceeded. Add to this, high shoes with little irons on the heels, a tall hat with a narrow brim, hair worn in a tuft, an enormous cane, and conversation set off by puns of Potier. Over all, spurs and a moustache. At that epoch moustaches indicated the bourgeois, and spurs the pedestrian.
U||The provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest of moustaches.
U||It was the period of the conflict of the republics of South America with the King of Spain, of Bolivar against Morillo. Narrow-brimmed hats were royalist, and were called morillos; liberals wore hats with wide brims, which were called bolivars.
U||Eight or ten months, then, after that which is related in the preceding pages, towards the first of January, 1823, on a snowy evening, one of these dandies, one of these unemployed, a ‚Äúright thinker,‚Äù for he wore a morillo, and was, moreover, warmly enveloped in one of those large cloaks which completed the fashionable costume in cold weather, was amusing himself by tormenting a creature who was prowling about in a ball-dress, with neck uncovered and flowers in her hair, in front of the officers‚Äô caf√©. This dandy was smoking, for he was decidedly fashionable.
U||Each time that the woman passed in front of him, he bestowed on her, together with a puff from his cigar, some apostrophe which he considered witty and mirthful, such as, ‚ÄúHow ugly you are!‚ÄîWill you get out of my sight?‚ÄîYou have no teeth!‚Äù etc., etc. This gentleman was known as M. Bamatabois. The woman, a melancholy, decorated spectre which went and came through the snow, made him no reply, did not even glance at him, and nevertheless continued her promenade in silence, and with a sombre regularity, which brought her every five minutes within reach of this sarcasm, like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods. The small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger; and taking advantage of a moment when her back was turned, he crept up behind her with the gait of a wolf, and stifling his laugh, bent down, picked up a handful of snow from the pavement, and thrust it abruptly into her back, between her bare shoulders. The woman uttered a roar, whirled round, gave a leap like a panther, 
U||and hurled herself upon the man, burying her nails in his face, with the most frightful words which could fall from the guard-room into the gutter. These insults, poured forth in a voice roughened by brandy, did, indeed, proceed in hideous wise from a mouth which lacked its two front teeth. It was Fantine.
U||At the noise thus produced, the officers ran out in throngs from the caf√©, passers-by collected, and a large and merry circle, hooting and applauding, was formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings, whom there was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman: the man struggling, his hat on the ground; the woman striking out with feet and fists, bareheaded, howling, minus hair and teeth, livid with wrath, horrible.
U||Suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd, seized the woman by her satin bodice, which was covered with mud, and said to her, ‚ÄúFollow me!‚Äù
U||The woman raised her head; her furious voice suddenly died away. Her eyes were glassy; she turned pale instead of livid, and she trembled with a quiver of terror. She had recognized Javert.
U||The dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape.
U||CHAPTER XIII‚ÄîTHE SOLUTION OF SOME QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH THE MUNICIPAL POLICE
U||Javert thrust aside the spectators, broke the circle, and set out with long strides towards the police station, which is situated at the extremity of the square, dragging the wretched woman after him. She yielded mechanically. Neither he nor she uttered a word. The cloud of spectators followed, jesting, in a paroxysm of delight. Supreme misery an occasion for obscenity.
U||On arriving at the police station, which was a low room, warmed by a stove, with a glazed and grated door opening on the street, and guarded by a detachment, Javert opened the door, entered with Fantine, and shut the door behind him, to the great disappointment of the curious, who raised themselves on tiptoe, and craned their necks in front of the thick glass of the station-house, in their effort to see. Curiosity is a sort of gluttony. To see is to devour.
U||On entering, Fantine fell down in a corner, motionless and mute, crouching down like a terrified dog.
U||The sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table. Javert seated himself, drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket, and began to write.
U||This class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion of the police. The latter do what they please, punish them, as seems good to them, and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which they entitle their industry and their liberty. Javert was impassive; his grave face betrayed no emotion whatever. Nevertheless, he was seriously and deeply preoccupied. It was one of those moments when he was exercising without control, but subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience, his redoubtable discretionary power. At that moment he was conscious that his police agent‚Äôs stool was a tribunal. He was entering judgment. He judged and condemned. He summoned all the ideas which could possibly exist in his mind, around the great thing which he was doing. The more he examined the deed of this woman, the more shocked he felt. It was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime. He had just beheld, yonder, in the street, society, in the person of a freeholder and an elector, in
U||sulted and attacked by a creature who was outside all pales. A prostitute had made an attempt on the life of a citizen. He had seen that, he, Javert. He wrote in silence.
U||When he had finished he signed the paper, folded it, and said to the sergeant of the guard, as he handed it to him, ‚ÄúTake three men and conduct this creature to jail.‚Äù
U||Then, turning to Fantine, ‚ÄúYou are to have six months of it.‚Äù The unhappy woman shuddered.
U||‚ÄúSix months! six months of prison!‚Äù she exclaimed. ‚ÄúSix months in which to earn seven sous a day! But what will become of Cosette? My daughter! my daughter! But I still owe the Th√©nardiers over a hundred francs; do you know that, Monsieur Inspector?‚Äù
U||She dragged herself across the damp floor, among the muddy boots of all those men, without rising, with clasped hands, and taking great strides on her knees.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Javert,‚Äù said she, ‚ÄúI beseech your mercy. I assure you that I was not in the wrong. If you had seen the beginning, you would have seen. I swear to you by the good God that I was not to blame! That gentleman, the bourgeois, whom I do not know, put snow in my back. Has any one the right to put snow down our backs when we are walking along peaceably, and doing no harm to any one? I am rather ill, as you see. And then, he had been saying impertinent things to me for a long time: ‚ÄòYou are ugly! you have no teeth!‚Äô I know well that I have no longer those teeth. I did nothing; I said to myself, ‚ÄòThe gentleman is amusing himself.‚Äô I was honest with him; I did not speak to him. It was at that moment that he put the snow down my back. Monsieur Javert, good Monsieur Inspector! is there not some person here who saw it and can tell you that this is quite true? Perhaps I did wrong to get angry. You know that one is not master of one‚Äôs self at the first moment. One gives way to vivacity; and then,
U|| when some one puts something cold down your back just when you are not expecting it! I did wrong to spoil that gentleman‚Äôs hat. Why did he go away? I would ask his pardon. Oh, my God! It makes no difference to me whether I ask his pardon. Do me the favor to-day, for this once, Monsieur Javert. Hold! you do not know that in prison one can earn only seven sous a day; it is not the government‚Äôs fault, but seven sous is one‚Äôs earnings; and just fancy, I must pay one hundred francs, or my little girl will be sent to me. Oh, my God! I cannot have her with me. What I do is so vile! Oh, my Cosette! Oh, my little angel of the Holy Virgin! what will become of her, poor creature? I will tell you: it is the Th√©nardiers, inn-keepers, peasants; and such people are unreasonable. They want money. Don‚Äôt put me in prison! You see, there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street to get along as best she may, in the very heart of the winter; and you must have pity on such a being, my good Monsieur Javert
U||. If she were older, she might earn her living; but it cannot be done at that age. I am not a bad woman at bottom. It is not cowardliness and gluttony that have made me what I am. If I have drunk brandy, it was out of misery. I do not love it; but it benumbs the senses. When I was happy, it was only necessary to glance into my closets, and it would have been evident that I was not a coquettish and untidy woman. I had linen, a great deal of linen. Have pity on me, Monsieur Javert!‚Äù
U||She spoke thus, rent in twain, shaken with sobs, blinded with tears, her neck bare, wringing her hands, and coughing with a dry, short cough, stammering softly with a voice of agony. Great sorrow is a divine and terrible ray, which transfigures the unhappy. At that moment Fantine had become beautiful once more. From time to time she paused, and tenderly kissed the police agent‚Äôs coat. She would have softened a heart of granite; but a heart of wood cannot be softened.
U||‚ÄúCome!‚Äù said Javert, ‚ÄúI have heard you out. Have you entirely finished? You will get six months. Now march! The Eternal Father in person could do nothing more.‚Äù
U||At these solemn words, ‚Äúthe Eternal Father in person could do nothing more,‚Äù she understood that her fate was sealed. She sank down, murmuring, ‚ÄúMercy!‚Äù
U||Javert turned his back.
U||The soldiers seized her by the arms.
U||A few moments earlier a man had entered, but no one had paid any heed to him. He shut the door, leaned his back against it, and listened to Fantine‚Äôs despairing supplications.
U||At the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate woman, who would not rise, he emerged from the shadow, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúOne moment, if you please.‚Äù
U||Javert raised his eyes and recognized M. Madeleine. He removed his hat, and, saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúExcuse me, Mr. Mayor‚Äî‚Äù
U||The words ‚ÄúMr. Mayor‚Äù produced a curious effect upon Fantine. She rose to her feet with one bound, like a spectre springing from the earth, thrust aside the soldiers with both arms, walked straight up to M. Madeleine before any one could prevent her, and gazing intently at him, with a bewildered air, she cried:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAh! so it is you who are M. le Maire!‚Äù
U||Then she burst into a laugh, and spit in his face.
U||M. Madeleine wiped his face, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúInspector Javert, set this woman at liberty.‚Äù
U||Javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad. He experienced at that moment, blow upon blow and almost simultaneously, the most violent emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life. To see a woman of the town spit in the mayor‚Äôs face was a thing so monstrous that, in his most daring flights of fancy, he would have regarded it as a sacrilege to believe it possible. On the other hand, at the very bottom of his thought, he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was, and as to what this mayor might be; and then he, with horror, caught a glimpse of I know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack. But when he beheld that mayor, that magistrate, calmly wipe his face and say, ‚ÄúSet this woman at liberty,‚Äù he underwent a sort of intoxication of amazement; thought and word failed him equally; the sum total of possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case. He remained mute.
U||The words had produced no less strange an effect on Fantine. She raised her bare arm, and clung to the damper of the stove, like a person who is reeling. Nevertheless, she glanced about her, and began to speak in a low voice, as though talking to herself:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAt liberty! I am to be allowed to go! I am not to go to prison for six months! Who said that? It is not possible that any one could have said that. I did not hear aright. It cannot have been that monster of a mayor! Was it you, my good Monsieur Javert, who said that I was to be set free? Oh, see here! I will tell you about it, and you will let me go. That monster of a mayor, that old blackguard of a mayor, is the cause of all. Just imagine, Monsieur Javert, he turned me out! all because of a pack of rascally women, who gossip in the workroom. If that is not a horror, what is? To dismiss a poor girl who is doing her work honestly! Then I could no longer earn enough, and all this misery followed. In the first place, there is one improvement which these gentlemen of the police ought to make, and that is, to prevent prison contractors from wronging poor people. I will explain it to you, you see: you are earning twelve sous at shirt-making, the price falls to nine sous; and it is not enough to live on. Then on
U||e has to become whatever one can. As for me, I had my little Cosette, and I was actually forced to become a bad woman. Now you understand how it is that that blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief. After that I stamped on that gentleman‚Äôs hat in front of the officers‚Äô caf√©; but he had spoiled my whole dress with snow. We women have but one silk dress for evening wear. You see that I did not do wrong deliberately‚Äîtruly, Monsieur Javert; and everywhere I behold women who are far more wicked than I, and who are much happier. O Monsieur Javert! it was you who gave orders that I am to be set free, was it not? Make inquiries, speak to my landlord; I am paying my rent now; they will tell you that I am perfectly honest. Ah! my God! I beg your pardon; I have unintentionally touched the damper of the stove, and it has made it smoke.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine listened to her with profound attention. While she was speaking, he fumbled in his waistcoat, drew out his purse and opened it. It was empty. He put it back in his pocket. He said to Fantine, ‚ÄúHow much did you say that you owed?‚Äù
U||Fantine, who was looking at Javert only, turned towards him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWas I speaking to you?‚Äù
U||Then, addressing the soldiers:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSay, you fellows, did you see how I spit in his face? Ah! you old wretch of a mayor, you came here to frighten me, but I‚Äôm not afraid of you. I am afraid of Monsieur Javert. I am afraid of my good Monsieur Javert!‚Äù
U||So saying, she turned to the inspector again:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd yet, you see, Mr. Inspector, it is necessary to be just. I understand that you are just, Mr. Inspector; in fact, it is perfectly simple: a man amuses himself by putting snow down a woman‚Äôs back, and that makes the officers laugh; one must divert themselves in some way; and we‚Äîwell, we are here for them to amuse themselves with, of course! And then, you, you come; you are certainly obliged to preserve order, you lead off the woman who is in the wrong; but on reflection, since you are a good man, you say that I am to be set at liberty; it is for the sake of the little one, for six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child. ‚ÄòOnly, don‚Äôt do it again, you hussy!‚Äô Oh! I won‚Äôt do it again, Monsieur Javert! They may do whatever they please to me now; I will not stir. But to-day, you see, I cried because it hurt me. I was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all; and then as I told you, I am not well; I have a cough; I seem to have a burning ball in my stomach, and the doctor t
U||ells me, ‚ÄòTake care of yourself.‚Äô Here, feel, give me your hand; don‚Äôt be afraid‚Äîit is here.‚Äù
U||She no longer wept, her voice was caressing; she placed Javert‚Äôs coarse hand on her delicate, white throat and looked smilingly at him.
U||All at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments, dropped the folds of her skirt, which had been pushed up as she dragged herself along, almost to the height of her knee, and stepped towards the door, saying to the soldiers in a low voice, and with a friendly nod:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúChildren, Monsieur l‚ÄôInspecteur has said that I am to be released, and I am going.‚Äù
U||She laid her hand on the latch of the door. One step more and she would be in the street.
U||Javert up to that moment had remained erect, motionless, with his eyes fixed on the ground, cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue, which is waiting to be put away somewhere.
U||The sound of the latch roused him. He raised his head with an expression of sovereign authority, an expression all the more alarming in proportion as the authority rests on a low level, ferocious in the wild beast, atrocious in the man of no estate.
U||‚ÄúSergeant!‚Äù he cried, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you see that that jade is walking off! Who bade you let her go?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI,‚Äù said Madeleine.
U||Fantine trembled at the sound of Javert‚Äôs voice, and let go of the latch as a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen. At the sound of Madeleine‚Äôs voice she turned around, and from that moment forth she uttered no word, nor dared so much as to breathe freely, but her glance strayed from Madeleine to Javert, and from Javert to Madeleine in turn, according to which was speaking.
U||It was evident that Javert must have been exasperated beyond measure before he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he had done, after the mayor‚Äôs suggestion that Fantine should be set at liberty. Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor‚Äôs presence? Had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any ‚Äúauthority‚Äù should have given such an order, and that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake for another, without intending it? Or, in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for the past two hours, did he say to himself, that it was necessary to recur to supreme resolutions, that it was indispensable that the small should be made great, that the police spy should transform himself into a magistrate, that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice, and that, in this prodigious extremity, order, law, morality, government, society in its entirety, was personified in him, Javert?
U||However that may be, when M. Madeleine uttered that word, I, as we have just heard, Police Inspector Javert was seen to turn toward the mayor, pale, cold, with blue lips, and a look of despair, his whole body agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence, and say to him, with downcast eyes but a firm voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMr. Mayor, that cannot be.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù said M. Madeleine.
U||‚ÄúThis miserable woman has insulted a citizen.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúInspector Javert,‚Äù replied the mayor, in a calm and conciliating tone, ‚Äúlisten. You are an honest man, and I feel no hesitation in explaining matters to you. Here is the true state of the case: I was passing through the square just as you were leading this woman away; there were still groups of people standing about, and I made inquiries and learned everything; it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who should have been arrested by properly conducted police.‚Äù
U||Javert retorted:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThis wretch has just insulted Monsieur le Maire.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat concerns me,‚Äù said M. Madeleine. ‚ÄúMy own insult belongs to me, I think. I can do what I please about it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI beg Monsieur le Maire‚Äôs pardon. The insult is not to him but to the law.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúInspector Javert,‚Äù replied M. Madeleine, ‚Äúthe highest law is conscience. I have heard this woman; I know what I am doing.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd I, Mr. Mayor, do not know what I see.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThen content yourself with obeying.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am obeying my duty. My duty demands that this woman shall serve six months in prison.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine replied gently:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHeed this well; she will not serve a single day.‚Äù
U||At this decisive word, Javert ventured to fix a searching look on the mayor and to say, but in a tone of voice that was still profoundly respectful:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am sorry to oppose Monsieur le Maire; it is for the first time in my life, but he will permit me to remark that I am within the bounds of my authority. I confine myself, since Monsieur le Maire desires it, to the question of the gentleman. I was present. This woman flung herself on Monsieur Bamatabois, who is an elector and the proprietor of that handsome house with a balcony, which forms the corner of the esplanade, three stories high and entirely of cut stone. Such things as there are in the world! In any case, Monsieur le Maire, this is a question of police regulations in the streets, and concerns me, and I shall detain this woman Fantine.‚Äù
U||Then M. Madeleine folded his arms, and said in a severe voice which no one in the town had heard hitherto:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal police. According to the terms of articles nine, eleven, fifteen, and sixty-six of the code of criminal examination, I am the judge. I order that this woman shall be set at liberty.‚Äù
U||Javert ventured to make a final effort.
U||‚ÄúBut, Mr. Mayor‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI refer you to article eighty-one of the law of the 13th of December, 1799, in regard to arbitrary detention.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMonsieur le Maire, permit me‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNot another word.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúLeave the room,‚Äù said M. Madeleine.
U||Javert received the blow erect, full in the face, in his breast, like a Russian soldier. He bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left the room.
U||Fantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he passed.
U||Nevertheless, she also was the prey to a strange confusion. She had just seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers. She had seen two men who held in their hands her liberty, her life, her soul, her child, in combat before her very eyes; one of these men was drawing her towards darkness, the other was leading her back towards the light. In this conflict, viewed through the exaggerations of terror, these two men had appeared to her like two giants; the one spoke like her demon, the other like her good angel. The angel had conquered the demon, and, strange to say, that which made her shudder from head to foot was the fact that this angel, this liberator, was the very man whom she abhorred, that mayor whom she had so long regarded as the author of all her woes, that Madeleine! And at the very moment when she had insulted him in so hideous a fashion, he had saved her! Had she, then, been mistaken? Must she change her whole soul? She did not know; she trembled. She listened in bewilderment, she
U|| looked on in affright, and at every word uttered by M. Madeleine she felt the frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within her, and something warm and ineffable, indescribable, which was both joy, confidence and love, dawn in her heart.
U||When Javert had taken his departure, M. Madeleine turned to her and said to her in a deliberate voice, like a serious man who does not wish to weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI have heard you. I knew nothing about what you have mentioned. I believe that it is true, and I feel that it is true. I was even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop. Why did you not apply to me? But here; I will pay your debts, I will send for your child, or you shall go to her. You shall live here, in Paris, or where you please. I undertake the care of your child and yourself. You shall not work any longer if you do not like. I will give all the money you require. You shall be honest and happy once more. And listen! I declare to you that if all is as you say,‚Äîand I do not doubt it,‚Äîyou have never ceased to be virtuous and holy in the sight of God. Oh! poor woman.‚Äù
U||This was more than Fantine could bear. To have Cosette! To leave this life of infamy. To live free, rich, happy, respectable with Cosette; to see all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of her misery. She stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her, and could only give vent to two or three sobs, ‚ÄúOh! Oh! Oh!‚Äù
U||Her limbs gave way beneath her, she knelt in front of M. Madeleine, and before he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press her lips to it.
U||Then she fainted.
U||BOOK SIXTH‚ÄîJAVERT
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîTHE BEGINNING OF REPOSE
U||M. Madeleine had Fantine removed to that infirmary which he had established in his own house. He confided her to the sisters, who put her to bed. A burning fever had come on. She passed a part of the night in delirium and raving. At length, however, she fell asleep.
U||On the morrow, towards midday, Fantine awoke. She heard some one breathing close to her bed; she drew aside the curtain and saw M. Madeleine standing there and looking at something over her head. His gaze was full of pity, anguish, and supplication. She followed its direction, and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was nailed to the wall.
U||Thenceforth, M. Madeleine was transfigured in Fantine‚Äôs eyes. He seemed to her to be clothed in light. He was absorbed in a sort of prayer. She gazed at him for a long time without daring to interrupt him. At last she said timidly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine had been there for an hour. He had been waiting for Fantine to awake. He took her hand, felt of her pulse, and replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell, I have slept,‚Äù she replied; ‚ÄúI think that I am better. It is nothing.‚Äù
U||He answered, responding to the first question which she had put to him as though he had just heard it:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI was praying to the martyr there on high.‚Äù
U||And he added in his own mind, ‚ÄúFor the martyr here below.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries. He knew all now. He knew Fantine‚Äôs history in all its heart-rending details. He went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou have suffered much, poor mother. Oh! do not complain; you now have the dowry of the elect. It is thus that men are transformed into angels. It is not their fault they do not know how to go to work otherwise. You see this hell from which you have just emerged is the first form of heaven. It was necessary to begin there.‚Äù
U||He sighed deeply. But she smiled on him with that sublime smile in which two teeth were lacking.
U||That same night, Javert wrote a letter. The next morning be posted it himself at the office of M. sur M. It was addressed to Paris, and the superscription ran: To Monsieur Chabouillet, Secretary of Monsieur le Pr√©fet of Police. As the affair in the station-house had been bruited about, the post-mistress and some other persons who saw the letter before it was sent off, and who recognized Javert‚Äôs handwriting on the cover, thought that he was sending in his resignation.
U||M. Madeleine made haste to write to the Th√©nardiers. Fantine owed them one hundred and twenty francs. He sent them three hundred francs, telling them to pay themselves from that sum, and to fetch the child instantly to M. sur M., where her sick mother required her presence.
U||This dazzled Th√©nardier. ‚ÄúThe devil!‚Äù said the man to his wife; ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let‚Äôs allow the child to go. This lark is going to turn into a milch cow. I see through it. Some ninny has taken a fancy to the mother.‚Äù
U||He replied with a very well drawn-up bill for five hundred and some odd francs. In this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over three hundred francs,‚Äîone for the doctor, the other for the apothecary who had attended and physicked √âponine and Azelma through two long illnesses. Cosette, as we have already said, had not been ill. It was only a question of a trifling substitution of names. At the foot of the memorandum Th√©nardier wrote, Received on account, three hundred francs.
U||M. Madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more, and wrote, ‚ÄúMake haste to bring Cosette.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúChristi!‚Äù said Th√©nardier, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs not give up the child.‚Äù
U||In the meantime, Fantine did not recover. She still remained in the infirmary.
U||The sisters had at first only received and nursed ‚Äúthat woman‚Äù with repugnance. Those who have seen the bas-reliefs of Rheims will recall the inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the foolish virgins. The ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubaj√¶ is one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity; the sisters felt it with the double force contributed by religion. But in a few days Fantine disarmed them. She said all kinds of humble and gentle things, and the mother in her provoked tenderness. One day the sisters heard her say amid her fever: ‚ÄúI have been a sinner; but when I have my child beside me, it will be a sign that God has pardoned me. While I was leading a bad life, I should not have liked to have my Cosette with me; I could not have borne her sad, astonished eyes. It was for her sake that I did evil, and that is why God pardons me. I shall feel the benediction of the good God when Cosette is here. I shall gaze at her; it will do me good to see that innocent 
U||creature. She knows nothing at all. She is an angel, you see, my sisters. At that age the wings have not fallen off.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine went to see her twice a day, and each time she asked him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúShall I see my Cosette soon?‚Äù
U||He answered:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúTo-morrow, perhaps. She may arrive at any moment. I am expecting her.‚Äù
U||And the mother‚Äôs pale face grew radiant.
U||‚ÄúOh!‚Äù she said, ‚Äúhow happy I am going to be!‚Äù
U||We have just said that she did not recover her health. On the contrary, her condition seemed to become more grave from week to week. That handful of snow applied to her bare skin between her shoulder-blades had brought about a sudden suppression of perspiration, as a consequence of which the malady which had been smouldering within her for many years was violently developed at last. At that time people were beginning to follow the fine La√´nnec‚Äôs fine suggestions in the study and treatment of chest maladies. The doctor sounded Fantine‚Äôs chest and shook his head.
U||M. Madeleine said to the doctor:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHas she not a child which she desires to see?‚Äù said the doctor.
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell! Make haste and get it here!‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine shuddered.
U||Fantine inquired:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat did the doctor say?‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine forced himself to smile.
U||‚ÄúHe said that your child was to be brought speedily. That that would restore your health.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOh!‚Äù she rejoined, ‚Äúhe is right! But what do those Th√©nardiers mean by keeping my Cosette from me! Oh! she is coming. At last I behold happiness close beside me!‚Äù
U||In the meantime Th√©nardier did not ‚Äúlet go of the child,‚Äù and gave a hundred insufficient reasons for it. Cosette was not quite well enough to take a journey in the winter. And then, there still remained some petty but pressing debts in the neighborhood, and they were collecting the bills for them, etc., etc.
U||‚ÄúI shall send some one to fetch Cosette!‚Äù said Father Madeleine. ‚ÄúIf necessary, I will go myself.‚Äù
U||He wrote the following letter to Fantine‚Äôs dictation, and made her sign it:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMONSIEUR TH√âNARDIER:‚Äî
U||You will deliver Cosette to this person.
U||You will be paid for all the little things.
U||I have the honor to salute you with respect.
U||‚ÄúFANTINE.‚Äù
U||In the meantime a serious incident occurred. Carve as we will the mysterious block of which our life is made, the black vein of destiny constantly reappears in it.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîHOW JEAN MAY BECOME CHAMP
U||One morning M. Madeleine was in his study, occupied in arranging in advance some pressing matters connected with the mayor‚Äôs office, in case he should decide to take the trip to Montfermeil, when he was informed that Police Inspector Javert was desirous of speaking with him. Madeleine could not refrain from a disagreeable impression on hearing this name. Javert had avoided him more than ever since the affair of the police-station, and M. Madeleine had not seen him.
U||‚ÄúAdmit him,‚Äù he said.
U||Javert entered.
U||M. Madeleine had retained his seat near the fire, pen in hand, his eyes fixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating, and which contained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction of police regulations. He did not disturb himself on Javert‚Äôs account. He could not help thinking of poor Fantine, and it suited him to be glacial in his manner.
U||Javert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor, whose back was turned to him. The mayor did not look at him, but went on annotating this docket.
U||Javert advanced two or three paces into the study, and halted, without breaking the silence.
U||If any physiognomist who had been familiar with Javert, and who had made a lengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization, this singular composite of the Roman, the Spartan, the monk, and the corporal, this spy who was incapable of a lie, this unspotted police agent‚Äîif any physiognomist had known his secret and long-cherished aversion for M. Madeleine, his conflict with the mayor on the subject of Fantine, and had examined Javert at that moment, he would have said to himself, ‚ÄúWhat has taken place?‚Äù It was evident to any one acquainted with that clear, upright, sincere, honest, austere, and ferocious conscience, that Javert had but just gone through some great interior struggle. Javert had nothing in his soul which he had not also in his countenance. Like violent people in general, he was subject to abrupt changes of opinion. His physiognomy had never been more peculiar and startling. On entering he bowed to M. Madeleine with a look in which there was neither rancor, anger, nor distrust; h
U||e halted a few paces in the rear of the mayor‚Äôs armchair, and there he stood, perfectly erect, in an attitude almost of discipline, with the cold, ingenuous roughness of a man who has never been gentle and who has always been patient; he waited without uttering a word, without making a movement, in genuine humility and tranquil resignation, calm, serious, hat in hand, with eyes cast down, and an expression which was half-way between that of a soldier in the presence of his officer and a criminal in the presence of his judge, until it should please the mayor to turn round. All the sentiments as well as all the memories which one might have attributed to him had disappeared. That face, as impenetrable and simple as granite, no longer bore any trace of anything but a melancholy depression. His whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and an indescribable courageous despondency.
U||At last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round.
U||‚ÄúWell! What is it? What is the matter, Javert?‚Äù
U||Javert remained silent for an instant as though collecting his ideas, then raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity, which did not, however, preclude simplicity.
U||‚ÄúThis is the matter, Mr. Mayor; a culpable act has been committed.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat act?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAn inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect, and in the gravest manner, towards a magistrate. I have come to bring the fact to your knowledge, as it is my duty to do.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWho is the agent?‚Äù asked M. Madeleine.
U||‚ÄúI,‚Äù said Javert.
U||‚ÄúYou?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou, Mr. Mayor.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine sat erect in his armchair. Javert went on, with a severe air and his eyes still cast down.
U||‚ÄúMr. Mayor, I have come to request you to instigate the authorities to dismiss me.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine opened his mouth in amazement. Javert interrupted him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou will say that I might have handed in my resignation, but that does not suffice. Handing in one‚Äôs resignation is honorable. I have failed in my duty; I ought to be punished; I must be turned out.‚Äù
U||And after a pause he added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMr. Mayor, you were severe with me the other day, and unjustly. Be so to-day, with justice.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCome, now! Why?‚Äù exclaimed M. Madeleine. ‚ÄúWhat nonsense is this? What is the meaning of this? What culpable act have you been guilty of towards me? What have you done to me? What are your wrongs with regard to me? You accuse yourself; you wish to be superseded‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTurned out,‚Äù said Javert.
U||‚ÄúTurned out; so it be, then. That is well. I do not understand.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou shall understand, Mr. Mayor.‚Äù
U||Javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest, and resumed, still coldly and sadly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMr. Mayor, six weeks ago, in consequence of the scene over that woman, I was furious, and I informed against you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúInformed against me!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAt the Prefecture of Police in Paris.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine, who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener than Javert himself, burst out laughing now:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAs a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAs an ex-convict.‚Äù
U||The mayor turned livid.
U||Javert, who had not raised his eyes, went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI thought it was so. I had had an idea for a long time; a resemblance; inquiries which you had caused to be made at Faverolles; the strength of your loins; the adventure with old Fauchelevant; your skill in marksmanship; your leg, which you drag a little;‚ÄîI hardly know what all,‚Äîabsurdities! But, at all events, I took you for a certain Jean Valjean.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA certain‚ÄîWhat did you say the name was?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúJean Valjean. He was a convict whom I was in the habit of seeing twenty years ago, when I was adjutant-guard of convicts at Toulon. On leaving the galleys, this Jean Valjean, as it appears, robbed a bishop; then he committed another theft, accompanied with violence, on a public highway on the person of a little Savoyard. He disappeared eight years ago, no one knows how, and he has been sought, I fancied. In short, I did this thing! Wrath impelled me; I denounced you at the Prefecture!‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine, who had taken up the docket again several moments before this, resumed with an air of perfect indifference:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd what reply did you receive?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat I was mad.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell, they were right.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt is lucky that you recognize the fact.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am forced to do so, since the real Jean Valjean has been found.‚Äù
U||The sheet of paper which M. Madeleine was holding dropped from his hand; he raised his head, gazed fixedly at Javert, and said with his indescribable accent:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù
U||Javert continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThis is the way it is, Mr. Mayor. It seems that there was in the neighborhood near Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher an old fellow who was called Father Champmathieu. He was a very wretched creature. No one paid any attention to him. No one knows what such people subsist on. Lately, last autumn, Father Champmathieu was arrested for the theft of some cider apples from‚ÄîWell, no matter, a theft had been committed, a wall scaled, branches of trees broken. My Champmathieu was arrested. He still had the branch of apple-tree in his hand. The scamp is locked up. Up to this point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor. But here is where Providence intervened.
U||‚ÄúThe jail being in a bad condition, the examining magistrate finds it convenient to transfer Champmathieu to Arras, where the departmental prison is situated. In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convict named Brevet, who is detained for I know not what, and who has been appointed turnkey of the house, because of good behavior. Mr. Mayor, no sooner had Champmathieu arrived than Brevet exclaims: ‚ÄòEh! Why, I know that man! He is a fagot!4 Take a good look at me, my good man! You are Jean Valjean!‚Äô ‚ÄòJean Valjean! who‚Äôs Jean Valjean?‚Äô Champmathieu feigns astonishment. ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt play the innocent dodge,‚Äô says Brevet. ‚ÄòYou are Jean Valjean! You have been in the galleys of Toulon; it was twenty years ago; we were there together.‚Äô Champmathieu denies it. Parbleu! You understand. The case is investigated. The thing was well ventilated for me. This is what they discovered: This Champmathieu had been, thirty years ago, a pruner of trees in various localities, notably at Faverolles. There all trace 
U||of him was lost. A long time afterwards he was seen again in Auvergne; then in Paris, where he is said to have been a wheelwright, and to have had a daughter, who was a laundress; but that has not been proved. Now, before going to the galleys for theft, what was Jean Valjean? A pruner of trees. Where? At Faverolles. Another fact. This Valjean‚Äôs Christian name was Jean, and his mother‚Äôs surname was Mathieu. What more natural to suppose than that, on emerging from the galleys, he should have taken his mother‚Äôs name for the purpose of concealing himself, and have called himself Jean Mathieu? He goes to Auvergne. The local pronunciation turns Jean into Chan‚Äîhe is called Chan Mathieu. Our man offers no opposition, and behold him transformed into Champmathieu. You follow me, do you not? Inquiries were made at Faverolles. The family of Jean Valjean is no longer there. It is not known where they have gone. You know that among those classes a family often disappears. Search was made, and nothing was found. Wh
U||en such people are not mud, they are dust. And then, as the beginning of the story dates thirty years back, there is no longer any one at Faverolles who knew Jean Valjean. Inquiries were made at Toulon. Besides Brevet, there are only two convicts in existence who have seen Jean Valjean; they are Cochepaille and Chenildieu, and are sentenced for life. They are taken from the galleys and confronted with the pretended Champmathieu. They do not hesitate; he is Jean Valjean for them as well as for Brevet. The same age,‚Äîhe is fifty-four,‚Äîthe same height, the same air, the same man; in short, it is he. It was precisely at this moment that I forwarded my denunciation to the Prefecture in Paris. I was told that I had lost my reason, and that Jean Valjean is at Arras, in the power of the authorities. You can imagine whether this surprised me, when I thought that I had that same Jean Valjean here. I write to the examining judge; he sends for me; Champmathieu is conducted to me‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù interposed M. Madeleine.
U||Javert replied, his face incorruptible, and as melancholy as ever:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMr. Mayor, the truth is the truth. I am sorry; but that man is Jean Valjean. I recognized him also.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine resumed in, a very low voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou are sure?‚Äù
U||Javert began to laugh, with that mournful laugh which comes from profound conviction.
U||‚ÄúO! Sure!‚Äù
U||He stood there thoughtfully for a moment, mechanically taking pinches of powdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl which stood on the table, and he added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd even now that I have seen the real Jean Valjean, I do not see how I could have thought otherwise. I beg your pardon, Mr. Mayor.‚Äù
U||Javert, as he addressed these grave and supplicating words to the man, who six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole station-house, and bade him ‚Äúleave the room,‚Äù‚ÄîJavert, that haughty man, was unconsciously full of simplicity and dignity,‚ÄîM. Madeleine made no other reply to his prayer than the abrupt question:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd what does this man say?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh! Indeed, Mr. Mayor, it‚Äôs a bad business. If he is Jean Valjean, he has his previous conviction against him. To climb a wall, to break a branch, to purloin apples, is a mischievous trick in a child; for a man it is a misdemeanor; for a convict it is a crime. Robbing and housebreaking‚Äîit is all there. It is no longer a question of correctional police; it is a matter for the Court of Assizes. It is no longer a matter of a few days in prison; it is the galleys for life. And then, there is the affair with the little Savoyard, who will return, I hope. The deuce! there is plenty to dispute in the matter, is there not? Yes, for any one but Jean Valjean. But Jean Valjean is a sly dog. That is the way I recognized him. Any other man would have felt that things were getting hot for him; he would struggle, he would cry out‚Äîthe kettle sings before the fire; he would not be Jean Valjean, et cetera. But he has not the appearance of understanding; he says, ‚ÄòI am Champmathieu, and I won‚Äôt depart from that!‚Äô
U|| He has an astonished air, he pretends to be stupid; it is far better. Oh! the rogue is clever! But it makes no difference. The proofs are there. He has been recognized by four persons; the old scamp will be condemned. The case has been taken to the Assizes at Arras. I shall go there to give my testimony. I have been summoned.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine had turned to his desk again, and taken up his docket, and was turning over the leaves tranquilly, reading and writing by turns, like a busy man. He turned to Javert:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat will do, Javert. In truth, all these details interest me but little. We are wasting our time, and we have pressing business on hand. Javert, you will betake yourself at once to the house of the woman Buseaupied, who sells herbs at the corner of the Rue Saint-Saulve. You will tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter Pierre Chesnelong. The man is a brute, who came near crushing this woman and her child. He must be punished. You will then go to M. Charcellay, Rue Montre-de-Champigny. He complained that there is a gutter on the adjoining house which discharges rain-water on his premises, and is undermining the foundations of his house. After that, you will verify the infractions of police regulations which have been reported to me in the Rue Guibourg, at Widow Doris‚Äôs, and Rue du Garraud-Blanc, at Madame Ren√©e le Boss√©‚Äôs, and you will prepare documents. But I am giving you a great deal of work. Are you not to be absent? Did you not tell me that you were going to Arras on that matte
U||r in a week or ten days?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSooner than that, Mr. Mayor.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOn what day, then?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy, I thought that I had said to Monsieur le Maire that the case was to be tried to-morrow, and that I am to set out by diligence to-night.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine made an imperceptible movement.
U||‚ÄúAnd how long will the case last?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOne day, at the most. The judgment will be pronounced to-morrow evening at latest. But I shall not wait for the sentence, which is certain; I shall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is well,‚Äù said M. Madeleine.
U||And he dismissed Javert with a wave of the hand.
U||Javert did not withdraw.
U||‚ÄúExcuse me, Mr. Mayor,‚Äù said he.
U||‚ÄúWhat is it now?‚Äù demanded M. Madeleine.
U||‚ÄúMr. Mayor, there is still something of which I must remind you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat I must be dismissed.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine rose.
U||‚ÄúJavert, you are a man of honor, and I esteem you. You exaggerate your fault. Moreover, this is an offence which concerns me. Javert, you deserve promotion instead of degradation. I wish you to retain your post.‚Äù
U||Javert gazed at M. Madeleine with his candid eyes, in whose depths his not very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible, and said in a tranquil voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMr. Mayor, I cannot grant you that.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI repeat,‚Äù replied M. Madeleine, ‚Äúthat the matter concerns me.‚Äù
U||But Javert, heeding his own thought only, continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSo far as exaggeration is concerned, I am not exaggerating. This is the way I reason: I have suspected you unjustly. That is nothing. It is our right to cherish suspicion, although suspicion directed above ourselves is an abuse. But without proofs, in a fit of rage, with the object of wreaking my vengeance, I have denounced you as a convict, you, a respectable man, a mayor, a magistrate! That is serious, very serious. I have insulted authority in your person, I, an agent of the authorities! If one of my subordinates had done what I have done, I should have declared him unworthy of the service, and have expelled him. Well? Stop, Mr. Mayor; one word more. I have often been severe in the course of my life towards others. That is just. I have done well. Now, if I were not severe towards myself, all the justice that I have done would become injustice. Ought I to spare myself more than others? No! What! I should be good for nothing but to chastise others, and not myself! Why, I should be a blackguard! Those who
U|| say, ‚ÄòThat blackguard of a Javert!‚Äô would be in the right. Mr. Mayor, I do not desire that you should treat me kindly; your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me when it was directed to others. I want none of it for myself. The kindness which consists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen, the police agent against the mayor, the man who is down against the man who is up in the world, is what I call false kindness. That is the sort of kindness which disorganizes society. Good God! it is very easy to be kind; the difficulty lies in being just. Come! if you had been what I thought you, I should not have been kind to you, not I! You would have seen! Mr. Mayor, I must treat myself as I would treat any other man. When I have subdued malefactors, when I have proceeded with vigor against rascals, I have often said to myself, ‚ÄòIf you flinch, if I ever catch you in fault, you may rest at your ease!‚Äô I have flinched, I have caught myself in a fault. So much the worse! Come, discharged, cashie
U||red, expelled! That is well. I have arms. I will till the soil; it makes no difference to me. Mr. Mayor, the good of the service demands an example. I simply require the discharge of Inspector Javert.‚Äù
U||All this was uttered in a proud, humble, despairing, yet convinced tone, which lent indescribable grandeur to this singular, honest man.
U||‚ÄúWe shall see,‚Äù said M. Madeleine.
U||And he offered him his hand.
U||Javert recoiled, and said in a wild voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúExcuse me, Mr. Mayor, but this must not be. A mayor does not offer his hand to a police spy.‚Äù
U||He added between his teeth:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúA police spy, yes; from the moment when I have misused the police. I am no more than a police spy.‚Äù
U||Then he bowed profoundly, and directed his steps towards the door.
U||There he wheeled round, and with eyes still downcast:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMr. Mayor,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI shall continue to serve until I am superseded.‚Äù
U||He withdrew. M. Madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm, sure step, which died away on the pavement of the corridor.
U||BOOK SEVENTH‚ÄîTHE CHAMPMATHIEU AFFAIR
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîSISTER SIMPLICE
U||The incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known at M. sur M. But the small portion of them which became known left such a memory in that town that a serious gap would exist in this book if we did not narrate them in their most minute details. Among these details the reader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances, which we preserve out of respect for the truth.
U||On the afternoon following the visit of Javert, M. Madeleine went to see Fantine according to his wont.
U||Before entering Fantine‚Äôs room, he had Sister Simplice summoned.
U||The two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary, Lazariste ladies, like all sisters of charity, bore the names of Sister Perp√©tue and Sister Simplice.
U||Sister Perp√©tue was an ordinary villager, a sister of charity in a coarse style, who had entered the service of God as one enters any other service. She was a nun as other women are cooks. This type is not so very rare. The monastic orders gladly accept this heavy peasant earthenware, which is easily fashioned into a Capuchin or an Ursuline. These rustics are utilized for the rough work of devotion. The transition from a drover to a Carmelite is not in the least violent; the one turns into the other without much effort; the fund of ignorance common to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand, and places the boor at once on the same footing as the monk: a little more amplitude in the smock, and it becomes a frock. Sister Perp√©tue was a robust nun from Marines near Pontoise, who chattered her patois, droned, grumbled, sugared the potion according to the bigotry or the hypocrisy of the invalid, treated her patients abruptly, roughly, was crabbed with the dying, almost flung God in their fac
U||es, stoned their death agony with prayers mumbled in a rage; was bold, honest, and ruddy.
U||Sister Simplice was white, with a waxen pallor. Beside Sister Perp√©tue, she was the taper beside the candle. Vincent de Paul has divinely traced the features of the Sister of Charity in these admirable words, in which he mingles as much freedom as servitude: ‚ÄúThey shall have for their convent only the house of the sick; for cell only a hired room; for chapel only their parish church; for cloister only the streets of the town and the wards of the hospitals; for enclosure only obedience; for gratings only the fear of God; for veil only modesty.‚Äù This ideal was realized in the living person of Sister Simplice: she had never been young, and it seemed as though she would never grow old. No one could have told Sister Simplice‚Äôs age. She was a person‚Äîwe dare not say a woman‚Äîwho was gentle, austere, well-bred, cold, and who had never lied. She was so gentle that she appeared fragile; but she was more solid than granite. She touched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pure and fine. There was, so
U|| to speak, silence in her speech; she said just what was necessary, and she possessed a tone of voice which would have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a drawing-room. This delicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown, finding in this harsh contact a continual reminder of heaven and of God. Let us emphasize one detail. Never to have lied, never to have said, for any interest whatever, even in indifference, any single thing which was not the truth, the sacred truth, was Sister Simplice‚Äôs distinctive trait; it was the accent of her virtue. She was almost renowned in the congregation for this imperturbable veracity. The Abb√© Sicard speaks of Sister Simplice in a letter to the deaf-mute Massieu. However pure and sincere we may be, we all bear upon our candor the crack of the little, innocent lie. She did not. Little lie, innocent lie‚Äîdoes such a thing exist? To lie is the absolute form of evil. To lie a little is not possible: he who lies, lies the whole lie. To lie is the very face of the demo
U||n. Satan has two names; he is called Satan and Lying. That is what she thought; and as she thought, so she did. The result was the whiteness which we have mentioned‚Äîa whiteness which covered even her lips and her eyes with radiance. Her smile was white, her glance was white. There was not a single spider‚Äôs web, not a grain of dust, on the glass window of that conscience. On entering the order of Saint Vincent de Paul, she had taken the name of Simplice by special choice. Simplice of Sicily, as we know, is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had been born at Segesta when she had been born at Syracuse‚Äîa lie which would have saved her. This patron saint suited this soul.
U||Sister Simplice, on her entrance into the order, had had two faults which she had gradually corrected: she had a taste for dainties, and she liked to receive letters. She never read anything but a book of prayers printed in Latin, in coarse type. She did not understand Latin, but she understood the book.
U||This pious woman had conceived an affection for Fantine, probably feeling a latent virtue there, and she had devoted herself almost exclusively to her care.
U||M. Madeleine took Sister Simplice apart and recommended Fantine to her in a singular tone, which the sister recalled later on.
U||On leaving the sister, he approached Fantine.
U||Fantine awaited M. Madeleine‚Äôs appearance every day as one awaits a ray of warmth and joy. She said to the sisters, ‚ÄúI only live when Monsieur le Maire is here.‚Äù
U||She had a great deal of fever that day. As soon as she saw M. Madeleine she asked him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd Cosette?‚Äù
U||He replied with a smile:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSoon.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine was the same as usual with Fantine. Only he remained an hour instead of half an hour, to Fantine‚Äôs great delight. He urged every one repeatedly not to allow the invalid to want for anything. It was noticed that there was a moment when his countenance became very sombre. But this was explained when it became known that the doctor had bent down to his ear and said to him, ‚ÄúShe is losing ground fast.‚Äù
U||Then he returned to the town-hall, and the clerk observed him attentively examining a road map of France which hung in his study. He wrote a few figures on a bit of paper with a pencil.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîTHE PERSPICACITY OF MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE
U||From the town-hall he betook himself to the extremity of the town, to a Fleming named Master Scaufflaer, French Scaufflaire, who let out ‚Äúhorses and cabriolets as desired.‚Äù
U||In order to reach this Scaufflaire, the shortest way was to take the little-frequented street in which was situated the parsonage of the parish in which M. Madeleine resided. The cur√© was, it was said, a worthy, respectable, and sensible man. At the moment when M. Madeleine arrived in front of the parsonage there was but one passer-by in the street, and this person noticed this: After the mayor had passed the priest‚Äôs house he halted, stood motionless, then turned about, and retraced his steps to the door of the parsonage, which had an iron knocker. He laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it; then he paused again and stopped short, as though in thought, and after the lapse of a few seconds, instead of allowing the knocker to fall abruptly, he placed it gently, and resumed his way with a sort of haste which had not been apparent previously.
U||M. Madeleine found Master Scaufflaire at home, engaged in stitching a harness over.
U||‚ÄúMaster Scaufflaire,‚Äù he inquired, ‚Äúhave you a good horse?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMr. Mayor,‚Äù said the Fleming, ‚Äúall my horses are good. What do you mean by a good horse?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a day.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe deuce!‚Äù said the Fleming. ‚ÄúTwenty leagues!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHitched to a cabriolet?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd how long can he rest at the end of his journey?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo traverse the same road?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe deuce! the deuce! And it is twenty leagues?‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilled some figures. He showed it to the Fleming. The figures were 5, 6, 8¬Ω.
U||‚ÄúYou see,‚Äù he said, ‚Äútotal, nineteen and a half; as well say twenty leagues.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMr. Mayor,‚Äù returned the Fleming, ‚ÄúI have just what you want. My little white horse‚Äîyou may have seen him pass occasionally; he is a small beast from Lower Boulonnais. He is full of fire. They wanted to make a saddle-horse of him at first. Bah! He reared, he kicked, he laid everybody flat on the ground. He was thought to be vicious, and no one knew what to do with him. I bought him. I harnessed him to a carriage. That is what he wanted, sir; he is as gentle as a girl; he goes like the wind. Ah! indeed he must not be mounted. It does not suit his ideas to be a saddle-horse. Every one has his ambition. ‚ÄòDraw? Yes. Carry? No.‚Äô We must suppose that is what he said to himself.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd he will accomplish the trip?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYour twenty leagues all at a full trot, and in less than eight hours. But here are the conditions.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúState them.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn the first place, you will give him half an hour‚Äôs breathing spell midway of the road; he will eat; and some one must be by while he is eating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his oats; for I have noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the stable men than eaten by the horses.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSome one will be by.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn the second place‚Äîis the cabriolet for Monsieur le Maire?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDoes Monsieur le Maire know how to drive?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell, Monsieur le Maire will travel alone and without baggage, in order not to overload the horse?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut as Monsieur le Maire will have no one with him, he will be obliged to take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is understood.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am to have thirty francs a day. The days of rest to be paid for also‚Äînot a farthing less; and the beast‚Äôs food to be at Monsieur le Maire‚Äôs expense.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse and laid them on the table.
U||‚ÄúHere is the pay for two days in advance.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFourthly, for such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy, and would fatigue the horse. Monsieur le Maire must consent to travel in a little tilbury that I own.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI consent to that.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt is light, but it has no cover.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat makes no difference to me.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHas Monsieur le Maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter?‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine did not reply. The Fleming resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat it is very cold?‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine preserved silence.
U||Master Scaufflaire continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat it may rain?‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine raised his head and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door to-morrow morning at half-past four o‚Äôclock.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOf course, Monsieur le Maire,‚Äù replied Scaufflaire; then, scratching a speck in the wood of the table with his thumb-nail, he resumed with that careless air which the Flemings understand so well how to mingle with their shrewdness:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBut this is what I am thinking of now: Monsieur le Maire has not told me where he is going. Where is Monsieur le Maire going?‚Äù
U||He had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of the conversation, but he did not know why he had not dared to put the question.
U||‚ÄúAre your horse‚Äôs forelegs good?‚Äù said M. Madeleine.
U||‚ÄúYes, Monsieur le Maire. You must hold him in a little when going down hill. Are there many descends between here and the place whither you are going?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDo not forget to be at my door at precisely half-past four o‚Äôclock to-morrow morning,‚Äù replied M. Madeleine; and he took his departure.
U||The Fleming remained ‚Äúutterly stupid,‚Äù as he himself said some time afterwards.
U||The mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened again; it was the mayor once more.
U||He still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Scaufflaire,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúat what sum do you estimate the value of the horse and tilbury which you are to let to me,‚Äîthe one bearing the other?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe one dragging the other, Monsieur le Maire,‚Äù said the Fleming, with a broad smile.
U||‚ÄúSo be it. Well?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDoes Monsieur le Maire wish to purchase them or me?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo; but I wish to guarantee you in any case. You shall give me back the sum at my return. At what value do you estimate your horse and cabriolet?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFive hundred francs, Monsieur le Maire.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHere it is.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine laid a bank-bill on the table, then left the room; and this time he did not return.
U||Master Scaufflaire experienced a frightful regret that he had not said a thousand francs. Besides the horse and tilbury together were worth but a hundred crowns.
U||The Fleming called his wife, and related the affair to her. ‚ÄúWhere the devil could Monsieur le Maire be going?‚Äù They held counsel together. ‚ÄúHe is going to Paris,‚Äù said the wife. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe it,‚Äù said the husband.
U||M. Madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it, and it lay on the chimney-piece. The Fleming picked it up and studied it. ‚ÄúFive, six, eight and a half? That must designate the posting relays.‚Äù He turned to his wife:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI have found out.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt is five leagues from here to Hesdin, six from Hesdin to Saint-Pol, eight and a half from Saint-Pol to Arras. He is going to Arras.‚Äù
U||Meanwhile, M. Madeleine had returned home. He had taken the longest way to return from Master Scaufflaire‚Äôs, as though the parsonage door had been a temptation for him, and he had wished to avoid it. He ascended to his room, and there he shut himself up, which was a very simple act, since he liked to go to bed early. Nevertheless, the portress of the factory, who was, at the same time, M. Madeleine‚Äôs only servant, noticed that the latter‚Äôs light was extinguished at half-past eight, and she mentioned it to the cashier when he came home, adding:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIs Monsieur le Maire ill? I thought he had a rather singular air.‚Äù
U||This cashier occupied a room situated directly under M. Madeleine‚Äôs chamber. He paid no heed to the portress‚Äôs words, but went to bed and to sleep. Towards midnight he woke up with a start; in his sleep he had heard a noise above his head. He listened; it was a footstep pacing back and forth, as though some one were walking in the room above him. He listened more attentively, and recognized M. Madeleine‚Äôs step. This struck him as strange; usually, there was no noise in M. Madeleine‚Äôs chamber until he rose in the morning. A moment later the cashier heard a noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened, and then shut again; then a piece of furniture was disarranged; then a pause ensued; then the step began again. The cashier sat up in bed, quite awake now, and staring; and through his window-panes he saw the reddish gleam of a lighted window reflected on the opposite wall; from the direction of the rays, it could only come from the window of M. Madeleine‚Äôs chamber. The reflection wavered, as 
U||though it came rather from a fire which had been lighted than from a candle. The shadow of the window-frame was not shown, which indicated that the window was wide open. The fact that this window was open in such cold weather was surprising. The cashier fell asleep again. An hour or two later he waked again. The same step was still passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead.
U||The reflection was still visible on the wall, but now it was pale and peaceful, like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle. The window was still open.
U||This is what had taken place in M. Madeleine‚Äôs room.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîA TEMPEST IN A SKULL
U||The reader has, no doubt, already divined that M. Madeleine is no other than Jean Valjean.
U||We have already gazed into the depths of this conscience; the moment has now come when we must take another look into it. We do so not without emotion and trepidation. There is nothing more terrible in existence than this sort of contemplation. The eye of the spirit can nowhere find more dazzling brilliance and more shadow than in man; it can fix itself on no other thing which is more formidable, more complicated, more mysterious, and more infinite. There is a spectacle more grand than the sea; it is heaven: there is a spectacle more grand than heaven; it is the inmost recesses of the soul.
U||To make the poem of the human conscience, were it only with reference to a single man, were it only in connection with the basest of men, would be to blend all epics into one superior and definitive epic. Conscience is the chaos of chim√¶ras, of lusts, and of temptations; the furnace of dreams; the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed; it is the pandemonium of sophisms; it is the battlefield of the passions. Penetrate, at certain hours, past the livid face of a human being who is engaged in reflection, and look behind, gaze into that soul, gaze into that obscurity. There, beneath that external silence, battles of giants, like those recorded in Homer, are in progress; skirmishes of dragons and hydras and swarms of phantoms, as in Milton; visionary circles, as in Dante. What a solemn thing is this infinity which every man bears within him, and which he measures with despair against the caprices of his brain and the actions of his life!
U||Alighieri one day met with a sinister-looking door, before which he hesitated. Here is one before us, upon whose threshold we hesitate. Let us enter, nevertheless.
U||We have but little to add to what the reader already knows of what had happened to Jean Valjean after the adventure with Little Gervais. From that moment forth he was, as we have seen, a totally different man. What the Bishop had wished to make of him, that he carried out. It was more than a transformation; it was a transfiguration.
U||He succeeded in disappearing, sold the Bishop‚Äôs silver, reserving only the candlesticks as a souvenir, crept from town to town, traversed France, came to M. sur M., conceived the idea which we have mentioned, accomplished what we have related, succeeded in rendering himself safe from seizure and inaccessible, and, thenceforth, established at M. sur M., happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the first half of his existence belied by the last, he lived in peace, reassured and hopeful, having henceforth only two thoughts,‚Äîto conceal his name and to sanctify his life; to escape men and to return to God.
U||These two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind that they formed but a single one there; both were equally absorbing and imperative and ruled his slightest actions. In general, they conspired to regulate the conduct of his life; they turned him towards the gloom; they rendered him kindly and simple; they counselled him to the same things. Sometimes, however, they conflicted. In that case, as the reader will remember, the man whom all the country of M. sur M. called M. Madeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second‚Äîhis security to his virtue. Thus, in spite of all his reserve and all his prudence, he had preserved the Bishop‚Äôs candlesticks, worn mourning for him, summoned and interrogated all the little Savoyards who passed that way, collected information regarding the families at Faverolles, and saved old Fauchelevent‚Äôs life, despite the disquieting insinuations of Javert. It seemed, as we have already remarked, as though he thought, following the example of all those who ha
U||ve been wise, holy, and just, that his first duty was not towards himself.
U||At the same time, it must be confessed, nothing just like this had yet presented itself.
U||Never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings we are narrating, engaged in so serious a struggle. He understood this confusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by Javert, when the latter entered his study. At the moment when that name, which he had buried beneath so many layers, was so strangely articulated, he was struck with stupor, and as though intoxicated with the sinister eccentricity of his destiny; and through this stupor he felt that shudder which precedes great shocks. He bent like an oak at the approach of a storm, like a soldier at the approach of an assault. He felt shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his head. As he listened to Javert, the first thought which occurred to him was to go, to run and denounce himself, to take that Champmathieu out of prison and place himself there; this was as painful and as poignant as an incision in the living flesh. Then it passed away, and he said to himself, ‚ÄúWe will see! We will see!‚Äù He 
U||repressed this first, generous instinct, and recoiled before heroism.
U||It would be beautiful, no doubt, after the Bishop‚Äôs holy words, after so many years of repentance and abnegation, in the midst of a penitence admirably begun, if this man had not flinched for an instant, even in the presence of so terrible a conjecture, but had continued to walk with the same step towards this yawning precipice, at the bottom of which lay heaven; that would have been beautiful; but it was not thus. We must render an account of the things which went on in this soul, and we can only tell what there was there. He was carried away, at first, by the instinct of self-preservation; he rallied all his ideas in haste, stifled his emotions, took into consideration Javert‚Äôs presence, that great danger, postponed all decision with the firmness of terror, shook off thought as to what he had to do, and resumed his calmness as a warrior picks up his buckler.
U||He remained in this state during the rest of the day, a whirlwind within, a profound tranquillity without. He took no ‚Äúpreservative measures,‚Äù as they may be called. Everything was still confused, and jostling together in his brain. His trouble was so great that he could not perceive the form of a single idea distinctly, and he could have told nothing about himself, except that he had received a great blow.
U||He repaired to Fantine‚Äôs bed of suffering, as usual, and prolonged his visit, through a kindly instinct, telling himself that he must behave thus, and recommend her well to the sisters, in case he should be obliged to be absent himself. He had a vague feeling that he might be obliged to go to Arras; and without having the least in the world made up his mind to this trip, he said to himself that being, as he was, beyond the shadow of any suspicion, there could be nothing out of the way in being a witness to what was to take place, and he engaged the tilbury from Scaufflaire in order to be prepared in any event.
U||He dined with a good deal of appetite.
U||On returning to his room, he communed with himself.
U||He examined the situation, and found it unprecedented; so unprecedented that in the midst of his reverie he rose from his chair, moved by some inexplicable impulse of anxiety, and bolted his door. He feared lest something more should enter. He was barricading himself against possibilities.
U||A moment later he extinguished his light; it embarrassed him.
U||It seemed to him as though he might be seen.
U||By whom?
U||Alas! That on which he desired to close the door had already entered; that which he desired to blind was staring him in the face,‚Äîhis conscience.
U||His conscience; that is to say, God.
U||Nevertheless, he deluded himself at first; he had a feeling of security and of solitude; the bolt once drawn, he thought himself impregnable; the candle extinguished, he felt himself invisible. Then he took possession of himself: he set his elbows on the table, leaned his head on his hand, and began to meditate in the dark.
U||‚ÄúWhere do I stand? Am not I dreaming? What have I heard? Is it really true that I have seen that Javert, and that he spoke to me in that manner? Who can that Champmathieu be? So he resembles me! Is it possible? When I reflect that yesterday I was so tranquil, and so far from suspecting anything! What was I doing yesterday at this hour? What is there in this incident? What will the end be? What is to be done?‚Äù
U||This was the torment in which he found himself. His brain had lost its power of retaining ideas; they passed like waves, and he clutched his brow in both hands to arrest them.
U||Nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which overwhelmed his will and his reason, and from which he sought to draw proof and resolution.
U||His head was burning. He went to the window and threw it wide open. There were no stars in the sky. He returned and seated himself at the table.
U||The first hour passed in this manner.
U||Gradually, however, vague outlines began to take form and to fix themselves in his meditation, and he was able to catch a glimpse with precision of the reality,‚Äînot the whole situation, but some of the details. He began by recognizing the fact that, critical and extraordinary as was this situation, he was completely master of it.
U||This only caused an increase of his stupor.
U||Independently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned to his actions, all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a hole in which to bury his name. That which he had always feared most of all in his hours of self-communion, during his sleepless nights, was to ever hear that name pronounced; he had said to himself, that that would be the end of all things for him; that on the day when that name made its reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about him, and‚Äîwho knows?‚Äîperhaps even his new soul within him, also. He shuddered at the very thought that this was possible. Assuredly, if any one had said to him at such moments that the hour would come when that name would ring in his ears, when the hideous words, Jean Valjean, would suddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him, when that formidable light, capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had enveloped himself, would suddenly blaze forth above his head, and that that name would not menace him,
U|| that that light would but produce an obscurity more dense, that this rent veil would but increase the mystery, that this earthquake would solidify his edifice, that this prodigious incident would have no other result, so far as he was concerned, if so it seemed good to him, than that of rendering his existence at once clearer and more impenetrable, and that, out of his confrontation with the phantom of Jean Valjean, the good and worthy citizen Monsieur Madeleine would emerge more honored, more peaceful, and more respected than ever‚Äîif any one had told him that, he would have tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman. Well, all this was precisely what had just come to pass; all that accumulation of impossibilities was a fact, and God had permitted these wild fancies to become real things!
U||His reverie continued to grow clearer. He came more and more to an understanding of his position.
U||It seemed to him that he had but just waked up from some inexplicable dream, and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the middle of the night, erect, shivering, holding back all in vain, on the very brink of the abyss. He distinctly perceived in the darkness a stranger, a man unknown to him, whom destiny had mistaken for him, and whom she was thrusting into the gulf in his stead; in order that the gulf might close once more, it was necessary that some one, himself or that other man, should fall into it: he had only let things take their course.
U||The light became complete, and he acknowledged this to himself: That his place was empty in the galleys; that do what he would, it was still awaiting him; that the theft from little Gervais had led him back to it; that this vacant place would await him, and draw him on until he filled it; that this was inevitable and fatal; and then he said to himself, ‚Äúthat, at this moment, he had a substitute; that it appeared that a certain Champmathieu had that ill luck, and that, as regards himself, being present in the galleys in the person of that Champmathieu, present in society under the name of M. Madeleine, he had nothing more to fear, provided that he did not prevent men from sealing over the head of that Champmathieu this stone of infamy which, like the stone of the sepulchre, falls once, never to rise again.‚Äù
U||All this was so strange and so violent, that there suddenly took place in him that indescribable movement, which no man feels more than two or three times in the course of his life, a sort of convulsion of the conscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart, which is composed of irony, of joy, and of despair, and which may be called an outburst of inward laughter.
U||He hastily relighted his candle.
U||‚ÄúWell, what then?‚Äù he said to himself; ‚Äúwhat am I afraid of? What is there in all that for me to think about? I am safe; all is over. I had but one partly open door through which my past might invade my life, and behold that door is walled up forever! That Javert, who has been annoying me so long; that terrible instinct which seemed to have divined me, which had divined me‚Äîgood God! and which followed me everywhere; that frightful hunting-dog, always making a point at me, is thrown off the scent, engaged elsewhere, absolutely turned from the trail: henceforth he is satisfied; he will leave me in peace; he has his Jean Valjean. Who knows? it is even probable that he will wish to leave town! And all this has been brought about without any aid from me, and I count for nothing in it! Ah! but where is the misfortune in this? Upon my honor, people would think, to see me, that some catastrophe had happened to me! After all, if it does bring harm to some one, that is not my fault in the least: it is Providen
U||ce which has done it all; it is because it wishes it so to be, evidently. Have I the right to disarrange what it has arranged? What do I ask now? Why should I meddle? It does not concern me; what! I am not satisfied: but what more do I want? The goal to which I have aspired for so many years, the dream of my nights, the object of my prayers to Heaven,‚Äîsecurity,‚ÄîI have now attained; it is God who wills it; I can do nothing against the will of God, and why does God will it? In order that I may continue what I have begun, that I may do good, that I may one day be a grand and encouraging example, that it may be said at last, that a little happiness has been attached to the penance which I have undergone, and to that virtue to which I have returned. Really, I do not understand why I was afraid, a little while ago, to enter the house of that good cur√©, and to ask his advice; this is evidently what he would have said to me: It is settled; let things take their course; let the good God do as he likes!‚Äù
U||Thus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience, bending over what may be called his own abyss; he rose from his chair, and began to pace the room: ‚ÄúCome,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúlet us think no more about it; my resolve is taken!‚Äù but he felt no joy.
U||Quite the reverse.
U||One can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one can the sea from returning to the shore: the sailor calls it the tide; the guilty man calls it remorse; God upheaves the soul as he does the ocean.
U||After the expiration of a few moments, do what he would, he resumed the gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened, saying that which he would have preferred to ignore, and listened to that which he would have preferred not to hear, yielding to that mysterious power which said to him: ‚ÄúThink!‚Äù as it said to another condemned man, two thousand years ago, ‚ÄúMarch on!‚Äù
U||Before proceeding further, and in order to make ourselves fully understood, let us insist upon one necessary observation.
U||It is certain that people do talk to themselves; there is no living being who has not done it. It may even be said that the word is never a more magnificent mystery than when it goes from thought to conscience within a man, and when it returns from conscience to thought; it is in this sense only that the words so often employed in this chapter, he said, he exclaimed, must be understood; one speaks to one‚Äôs self, talks to one‚Äôs self, exclaims to one‚Äôs self without breaking the external silence; there is a great tumult; everything about us talks except the mouth. The realities of the soul are nonetheless realities because they are not visible and palpable.
U||So he asked himself where he stood. He interrogated himself upon that ‚Äúsettled resolve.‚Äù He confessed to himself that all that he had just arranged in his mind was monstrous, that ‚Äúto let things take their course, to let the good God do as he liked,‚Äù was simply horrible; to allow this error of fate and of men to be carried out, not to hinder it, to lend himself to it through his silence, to do nothing, in short, was to do everything! that this was hypocritical baseness in the last degree! that it was a base, cowardly, sneaking, abject, hideous crime!
U||For the first time in eight years, the wretched man had just tasted the bitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action.
U||He spit it out with disgust.
U||He continued to question himself. He asked himself severely what he had meant by this, ‚ÄúMy object is attained!‚Äù He declared to himself that his life really had an object; but what object? To conceal his name? To deceive the police? Was it for so petty a thing that he had done all that he had done? Had he not another and a grand object, which was the true one‚Äîto save, not his person, but his soul; to become honest and good once more; to be a just man? Was it not that above all, that alone, which he had always desired, which the Bishop had enjoined upon him‚Äîto shut the door on his past? But he was not shutting it! great God! he was re-opening it by committing an infamous action! He was becoming a thief once more, and the most odious of thieves! He was robbing another of his existence, his life, his peace, his place in the sunshine. He was becoming an assassin. He was murdering, morally murdering, a wretched man. He was inflicting on him that frightful living death, that death beneath the open sky, whic
U||h is called the galleys. On the other hand, to surrender himself to save that man, struck down with so melancholy an error, to resume his own name, to become once more, out of duty, the convict Jean Valjean, that was, in truth, to achieve his resurrection, and to close forever that hell whence he had just emerged; to fall back there in appearance was to escape from it in reality. This must be done! He had done nothing if he did not do all this; his whole life was useless; all his penitence was wasted. There was no longer any need of saying, ‚ÄúWhat is the use?‚Äù He felt that the Bishop was there, that the Bishop was present all the more because he was dead, that the Bishop was gazing fixedly at him, that henceforth Mayor Madeleine, with all his virtues, would be abominable to him, and that the convict Jean Valjean would be pure and admirable in his sight; that men beheld his mask, but that the Bishop saw his face; that men saw his life, but that the Bishop beheld his conscience. So he must go to Arras, deli
U||ver the false Jean Valjean, and denounce the real one. Alas! that was the greatest of sacrifices, the most poignant of victories, the last step to take; but it must be done. Sad fate! he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes of God when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men.
U||‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúlet us decide upon this; let us do our duty; let us save this man.‚Äù He uttered these words aloud, without perceiving that he was speaking aloud.
U||He took his books, verified them, and put them in order. He flung in the fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassed tradesmen. He wrote and sealed a letter, and on the envelope it might have been read, had there been any one in his chamber at the moment, To Monsieur Laffitte, Banker, Rue d‚ÄôArtois, Paris. He drew from his secretary a pocket-book which contained several bank-notes and the passport of which he had made use that same year when he went to the elections.
U||Any one who had seen him during the execution of these various acts, into which there entered such grave thought, would have had no suspicion of what was going on within him. Only occasionally did his lips move; at other times he raised his head and fixed his gaze upon some point of the wall, as though there existed at that point something which he wished to elucidate or interrogate.
U||When he had finished the letter to M. Laffitte, he put it into his pocket, together with the pocket-book, and began his walk once more.
U||His reverie had not swerved from its course. He continued to see his duty clearly, written in luminous letters, which flamed before his eyes and changed its place as he altered the direction of his glance:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGo! Tell your name! Denounce yourself!‚Äù
U||In the same way he beheld, as though they had passed before him in visible forms, the two ideas which had, up to that time, formed the double rule of his soul,‚Äîthe concealment of his name, the sanctification of his life. For the first time they appeared to him as absolutely distinct, and he perceived the distance which separated them. He recognized the fact that one of these ideas was, necessarily, good, while the other might become bad; that the first was self-devotion, and that the other was personality; that the one said, my neighbour, and that the other said, myself; that one emanated from the light, and the other from darkness.
U||They were antagonistic. He saw them in conflict. In proportion as he meditated, they grew before the eyes of his spirit. They had now attained colossal statures, and it seemed to him that he beheld within himself, in that infinity of which we were recently speaking, in the midst of the darkness and the lights, a goddess and a giant contending.
U||He was filled with terror; but it seemed to him that the good thought was getting the upper hand.
U||He felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of his conscience and of his destiny; that the Bishop had marked the first phase of his new life, and that Champmathieu marked the second. After the grand crisis, the grand test.
U||But the fever, allayed for an instant, gradually resumed possession of him. A thousand thoughts traversed his mind, but they continued to fortify him in his resolution.
U||One moment he said to himself that he was, perhaps, taking the matter too keenly; that, after all, this Champmathieu was not interesting, and that he had actually been guilty of theft.
U||He answered himself: ‚ÄúIf this man has, indeed, stolen a few apples, that means a month in prison. It is a long way from that to the galleys. And who knows? Did he steal? Has it been proved? The name of Jean Valjean overwhelms him, and seems to dispense with proofs. Do not the attorneys for the Crown always proceed in this manner? He is supposed to be a thief because he is known to be a convict.‚Äù
U||In another instant the thought had occurred to him that, when he denounced himself, the heroism of his deed might, perhaps, be taken into consideration, and his honest life for the last seven years, and what he had done for the district, and that they would have mercy on him.
U||But this supposition vanished very quickly, and he smiled bitterly as he remembered that the theft of the forty sous from little Gervais put him in the position of a man guilty of a second offence after conviction, that this affair would certainly come up, and, according to the precise terms of the law, would render him liable to penal servitude for life.
U||He turned aside from all illusions, detached himself more and more from earth, and sought strength and consolation elsewhere. He told himself that he must do his duty; that perhaps he should not be more unhappy after doing his duty than after having avoided it; that if he allowed things to take their own course, if he remained at M. sur M., his consideration, his good name, his good works, the deference and veneration paid to him, his charity, his wealth, his popularity, his virtue, would be seasoned with a crime. And what would be the taste of all these holy things when bound up with this hideous thing? while, if he accomplished his sacrifice, a celestial idea would be mingled with the galleys, the post, the iron necklet, the green cap, unceasing toil, and pitiless shame.
U||At length he told himself that it must be so, that his destiny was thus allotted, that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made on high, that, in any case, he must make his choice: virtue without and abomination within, or holiness within and infamy without.
U||The stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage to fail, but his brain grow weary. He began to think of other things, of indifferent matters, in spite of himself.
U||The veins in his temples throbbed violently; he still paced to and fro; midnight sounded first from the parish church, then from the town-hall; he counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks, and compared the sounds of the two bells; he recalled in this connection the fact that, a few days previously, he had seen in an ironmonger‚Äôs shop an ancient clock for sale, upon which was written the name, Antoine-Albin de Romainville.
U||He was cold; he lighted a small fire; it did not occur to him to close the window.
U||In the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor; he was obliged to make a tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of his thoughts before midnight had struck; he finally succeeded in doing this.
U||‚ÄúAh! yes,‚Äù he said to himself, ‚ÄúI had resolved to inform against myself.‚Äù
U||And then, all of a sudden, he thought of Fantine.
U||‚ÄúHold!‚Äù said he, ‚Äúand what about that poor woman?‚Äù
U||Here a fresh crisis declared itself.
U||Fantine, by appearing thus abruptly in his reverie, produced the effect of an unexpected ray of light; it seemed to him as though everything about him were undergoing a change of aspect: he exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAh! but I have hitherto considered no one but myself; it is proper for me to hold my tongue or to denounce myself, to conceal my person or to save my soul, to be a despicable and respected magistrate, or an infamous and venerable convict; it is I, it is always I and nothing but I: but, good God! all this is egotism; these are diverse forms of egotism, but it is egotism all the same. What if I were to think a little about others? The highest holiness is to think of others; come, let us examine the matter. The I excepted, the I effaced, the I forgotten, what would be the result of all this? What if I denounce myself? I am arrested; this Champmathieu is released; I am put back in the galleys; that is well‚Äîand what then? What is going on here? Ah! here is a country, a town, here are factories, an industry, workers, both men and women, aged grandsires, children, poor people! All this I have created; all these I provide with their living; everywhere where there is a smoking chimney, it is I who have placed th
U||e brand on the hearth and meat in the pot; I have created ease, circulation, credit; before me there was nothing; I have elevated, vivified, informed with life, fecundated, stimulated, enriched the whole country-side; lacking me, the soul is lacking; I take myself off, everything dies: and this woman, who has suffered so much, who possesses so many merits in spite of her fall; the cause of all whose misery I have unwittingly been! And that child whom I meant to go in search of, whom I have promised to her mother; do I not also owe something to this woman, in reparation for the evil which I have done her? If I disappear, what happens? The mother dies; the child becomes what it can; that is what will take place, if I denounce myself. If I do not denounce myself? come, let us see how it will be if I do not denounce myself.‚Äù
U||After putting this question to himself, he paused; he seemed to undergo a momentary hesitation and trepidation; but it did not last long, and he answered himself calmly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWell, this man is going to the galleys; it is true, but what the deuce! he has stolen! There is no use in my saying that he has not been guilty of theft, for he has! I remain here; I go on: in ten years I shall have made ten millions; I scatter them over the country; I have nothing of my own; what is that to me? It is not for myself that I am doing it; the prosperity of all goes on augmenting; industries are aroused and animated; factories and shops are multiplied; families, a hundred families, a thousand families, are happy; the district becomes populated; villages spring up where there were only farms before; farms rise where there was nothing; wretchedness disappears, and with wretchedness debauchery, prostitution, theft, murder; all vices disappear, all crimes: and this poor mother rears her child; and behold a whole country rich and honest! Ah! I was a fool! I was absurd! what was that I was saying about denouncing myself? I really must pay attention and not be precipitate about anything. What! becau
U||se it would have pleased me to play the grand and generous; this is melodrama, after all; because I should have thought of no one but myself, the idea! for the sake of saving from a punishment, a trifle exaggerated, perhaps, but just at bottom, no one knows whom, a thief, a good-for-nothing, evidently, a whole country-side must perish! a poor woman must die in the hospital! a poor little girl must die in the street! like dogs; ah, this is abominable! And without the mother even having seen her child once more, almost without the child‚Äôs having known her mother; and all that for the sake of an old wretch of an apple-thief who, most assuredly, has deserved the galleys for something else, if not for that; fine scruples, indeed, which save a guilty man and sacrifice the innocent, which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to live at most, and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel, and which sacrifice a whole population, mothers, wives, children. This poor little Cosette who has
U|| no one in the world but me, and who is, no doubt, blue with cold at this moment in the den of those Th√©nardiers; those peoples are rascals; and I was going to neglect my duty towards all these poor creatures; and I was going off to denounce myself; and I was about to commit that unspeakable folly! Let us put it at the worst: suppose that there is a wrong action on my part in this, and that my conscience will reproach me for it some day, to accept, for the good of others, these reproaches which weigh only on myself; this evil action which compromises my soul alone; in that lies self-sacrifice; in that alone there is virtue.‚Äù
U||He rose and resumed his march; this time, he seemed to be content.
U||Diamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth; truths are found only in the depths of thought. It seemed to him, that, after having descended into these depths, after having long groped among the darkest of these shadows, he had at last found one of these diamonds, one of these truths, and that he now held it in his hand, and he was dazzled as he gazed upon it.
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he thought, ‚Äúthis is right; I am on the right road; I have the solution; I must end by holding fast to something; my resolve is taken; let things take their course; let us no longer vacillate; let us no longer hang back; this is for the interest of all, not for my own; I am Madeleine, and Madeleine I remain. Woe to the man who is Jean Valjean! I am no longer he; I do not know that man; I no longer know anything; it turns out that some one is Jean Valjean at the present moment; let him look out for himself; that does not concern me; it is a fatal name which was floating abroad in the night; if it halts and descends on a head, so much the worse for that head.‚Äù
U||He looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney-piece, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHold! it has relieved me to come to a decision; I am quite another man now.‚Äù
U||He proceeded a few paces further, then he stopped short.
U||‚ÄúCome!‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI must not flinch before any of the consequences of the resolution which I have once adopted; there are still threads which attach me to that Jean Valjean; they must be broken; in this very room there are objects which would betray me, dumb things which would bear witness against me; it is settled; all these things must disappear.‚Äù
U||He fumbled in his pocket, drew out his purse, opened it, and took out a small key; he inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could hardly be seen, so hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the design which covered the wall-paper; a secret receptacle opened, a sort of false cupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and the chimney-piece; in this hiding-place there were some rags‚Äîa blue linen blouse, an old pair of trousers, an old knapsack, and a huge thorn cudgel shod with iron at both ends. Those who had seen Jean Valjean at the epoch when he passed through D‚Äî‚Äî in October, 1815, could easily have recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit.
U||He had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks, in order to remind himself continually of his starting-point, but he had concealed all that came from the galleys, and he had allowed the candlesticks which came from the Bishop to be seen.
U||He cast a furtive glance towards the door, as though he feared that it would open in spite of the bolt which fastened it; then, with a quick and abrupt movement, he took the whole in his arms at once, without bestowing so much as a glance on the things which he had so religiously and so perilously preserved for so many years, and flung them all, rags, cudgel, knapsack, into the fire.
U||Candlesticks Into the Fire
U||He closed the false cupboard again, and with redoubled precautions, henceforth unnecessary, since it was now empty, he concealed the door behind a heavy piece of furniture, which he pushed in front of it.
U||After the lapse of a few seconds, the room and the opposite wall were lighted up with a fierce, red, tremulous glow. Everything was on fire; the thorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of the chamber.
U||As the knapsack was consumed, together with the hideous rags which it contained, it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes. By bending over, one could have readily recognized a coin,‚Äîno doubt the forty-sou piece stolen from the little Savoyard.
U||He did not look at the fire, but paced back and forth with the same step.
U||All at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks, which shone vaguely on the chimney-piece, through the glow.
U||‚ÄúHold!‚Äù he thought; ‚Äúthe whole of Jean Valjean is still in them. They must be destroyed also.‚Äù
U||He seized the two candlesticks.
U||There was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape, and converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal.
U||He bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment. He felt a sense of real comfort. ‚ÄúHow good warmth is!‚Äù said he.
U||He stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks.
U||A minute more, and they were both in the fire.
U||At that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within him shouting: ‚ÄúJean Valjean! Jean Valjean!‚Äù
U||His hair rose upright: he became like a man who is listening to some terrible thing.
U||‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs it! finish!‚Äù said the voice. ‚ÄúComplete what you are about! Destroy these candlesticks! Annihilate this souvenir! Forget the Bishop! Forget everything! Destroy this Champmathieu, do! That is right! Applaud yourself! So it is settled, resolved, fixed, agreed: here is an old man who does not know what is wanted of him, who has, perhaps, done nothing, an innocent man, whose whole misfortune lies in your name, upon whom your name weighs like a crime, who is about to be taken for you, who will be condemned, who will finish his days in abjectness and horror. That is good! Be an honest man yourself; remain Monsieur le Maire; remain honorable and honored; enrich the town; nourish the indigent; rear the orphan; live happy, virtuous, and admired; and, during this time, while you are here in the midst of joy and light, there will be a man who will wear your red blouse, who will bear your name in ignominy, and who will drag your chain in the galleys. Yes, it is well arranged thus. Ah, wretch!‚Äù
U||The perspiration streamed from his brow. He fixed a haggard eye on the candlesticks. But that within him which had spoken had not finished. The voice continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúJean Valjean, there will be around you many voices, which will make a great noise, which will talk very loud, and which will bless you, and only one which no one will hear, and which will curse you in the dark. Well! listen, infamous man! All those benedictions will fall back before they reach heaven, and only the malediction will ascend to God.‚Äù
U||This voice, feeble at first, and which had proceeded from the most obscure depths of his conscience, had gradually become startling and formidable, and he now heard it in his very ear. It seemed to him that it had detached itself from him, and that it was now speaking outside of him. He thought that he heard the last words so distinctly, that he glanced around the room in a sort of terror.
U||‚ÄúIs there any one here?‚Äù he demanded aloud, in utter bewilderment.
U||Then he resumed, with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHow stupid I am! There can be no one!‚Äù
U||There was some one; but the person who was there was of those whom the human eye cannot see.
U||He placed the candlesticks on the chimney-piece.
U||Then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp, which troubled the dreams of the sleeping man beneath him, and awoke him with a start.
U||This tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated him. It sometimes seems, on supreme occasions, as though people moved about for the purpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounter by change of place. After the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew his position.
U||He now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he had arrived in turn. The two ideas which counselled him appeared to him equally fatal. What a fatality! What conjunction that that Champmathieu should have been taken for him; to be overwhelmed by precisely the means which Providence seemed to have employed, at first, to strengthen his position!
U||There was a moment when he reflected on the future. Denounce himself, great God! Deliver himself up! With immense despair he faced all that he should be obliged to leave, all that he should be obliged to take up once more. He should have to bid farewell to that existence which was so good, so pure, so radiant, to the respect of all, to honor, to liberty. He should never more stroll in the fields; he should never more hear the birds sing in the month of May; he should never more bestow alms on the little children; he should never more experience the sweetness of having glances of gratitude and love fixed upon him; he should quit that house which he had built, that little chamber! Everything seemed charming to him at that moment. Never again should he read those books; never more should he write on that little table of white wood; his old portress, the only servant whom he kept, would never more bring him his coffee in the morning. Great God! instead of that, the convict gang, the iron necklet, the red waistco
U||at, the chain on his ankle, fatigue, the cell, the camp bed all those horrors which he knew so well! At his age, after having been what he was! If he were only young again! but to be addressed in his old age as ‚Äúthou‚Äù by any one who pleased; to be searched by the convict-guard; to receive the galley-sergeant‚Äôs cudgellings; to wear iron-bound shoes on his bare feet; to have to stretch out his leg night and morning to the hammer of the roundsman who visits the gang; to submit to the curiosity of strangers, who would be told: ‚ÄúThat man yonder is the famous Jean Valjean, who was mayor of M. sur M.‚Äù; and at night, dripping with perspiration, overwhelmed with lassitude, their green caps drawn over their eyes, to remount, two by two, the ladder staircase of the galleys beneath the sergeant‚Äôs whip. Oh, what misery! Can destiny, then, be as malicious as an intelligent being, and become as monstrous as the human heart?
U||And do what he would, he always fell back upon the heartrending dilemma which lay at the foundation of his reverie: ‚ÄúShould he remain in paradise and become a demon? Should he return to hell and become an angel?‚Äù
U||What was to be done? Great God! what was to be done?
U||The torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty was unchained afresh within him. His ideas began to grow confused once more; they assumed a kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is peculiar to despair. The name of Romainville recurred incessantly to his mind, with the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past. He thought that Romainville was a little grove near Paris, where young lovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of April.
U||He wavered outwardly as well as inwardly. He walked like a little child who is permitted to toddle alone.
U||At intervals, as he combated his lassitude, he made an effort to recover the mastery of his mind. He tried to put to himself, for the last time, and definitely, the problem over which he had, in a manner, fallen prostrate with fatigue: Ought he to denounce himself? Ought he to hold his peace? He could not manage to see anything distinctly. The vague aspects of all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched out by his meditations quivered and vanished, one after the other, into smoke. He only felt that, to whatever course of action he made up his mind, something in him must die, and that of necessity, and without his being able to escape the fact; that he was entering a sepulchre on the right hand as much as on the left; that he was passing through a death agony,‚Äîthe agony of his happiness, or the agony of his virtue.
U||Alas! all his resolution had again taken possession of him. He was no further advanced than at the beginning.
U||Thus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish. Eighteen hundred years before this unfortunate man, the mysterious Being in whom are summed up all the sanctities and all the sufferings of humanity had also long thrust aside with his hand, while the olive-trees quivered in the wild wind of the infinite, the terrible cup which appeared to Him dripping with darkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths all studded with stars.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîFORMS ASSUMED BY SUFFERING DURING SLEEP
U||Three o‚Äôclock in the morning had just struck, and he had been walking thus for five hours, almost uninterruptedly, when he at length allowed himself to drop into his chair.
U||There he fell asleep and had a dream.
U||This dream, like the majority of dreams, bore no relation to the situation, except by its painful and heart-rending character, but it made an impression on him. This nightmare struck him so forcibly that he wrote it down later on. It is one of the papers in his own handwriting which he has bequeathed to us. We think that we have here reproduced the thing in strict accordance with the text.
U||Of whatever nature this dream may be, the history of this night would be incomplete if we were to omit it: it is the gloomy adventure of an ailing soul.
U||Here it is. On the envelope we find this line inscribed, ‚ÄúThe Dream I had that Night.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI was in a plain; a vast, gloomy plain, where there was no grass. It did not seem to me to be daylight nor yet night.
U||‚ÄúI was walking with my brother, the brother of my childish years, the brother of whom, I must say, I never think, and whom I now hardly remember.
U||‚ÄúWe were conversing and we met some passers-by. We were talking of a neighbor of ours in former days, who had always worked with her window open from the time when she came to live on the street. As we talked we felt cold because of that open window.
U||‚ÄúThere were no trees in the plain. We saw a man passing close to us. He was entirely nude, of the hue of ashes, and mounted on a horse which was earth color. The man had no hair; we could see his skull and the veins on it. In his hand he held a switch which was as supple as a vine-shoot and as heavy as iron. This horseman passed and said nothing to us.
U||‚ÄúMy brother said to me, ‚ÄòLet us take to the hollow road.‚Äô
U||‚ÄúThere existed a hollow way wherein one saw neither a single shrub nor a spear of moss. Everything was dirt-colored, even the sky. After proceeding a few paces, I received no reply when I spoke: I perceived that my brother was no longer with me.
U||‚ÄúI entered a village which I espied. I reflected that it must be Romainville. (Why Romainville?)5
U||‚ÄúThe first street that I entered was deserted. I entered a second street. Behind the angle formed by the two streets, a man was standing erect against the wall. I said to this man:‚Äî
U||‚Äú‚ÄòWhat country is this? Where am I?‚Äô The man made no reply. I saw the door of a house open, and I entered.
U||‚ÄúThe first chamber was deserted. I entered the second. Behind the door of this chamber a man was standing erect against the wall. I inquired of this man, ‚ÄòWhose house is this? Where am I?‚Äô The man replied not.
U||‚ÄúThe house had a garden. I quitted the house and entered the garden. The garden was deserted. Behind the first tree I found a man standing upright. I said to this man, ‚ÄòWhat garden is this? Where am I?‚Äô The man did not answer.
U||‚ÄúI strolled into the village, and perceived that it was a town. All the streets were deserted, all the doors were open. Not a single living being was passing in the streets, walking through the chambers or strolling in the gardens. But behind each angle of the walls, behind each door, behind each tree, stood a silent man. Only one was to be seen at a time. These men watched me pass.
U||‚ÄúI left the town and began to ramble about the fields.
U||‚ÄúAfter the lapse of some time I turned back and saw a great crowd coming up behind me. I recognized all the men whom I had seen in that town. They had strange heads. They did not seem to be in a hurry, yet they walked faster than I did. They made no noise as they walked. In an instant this crowd had overtaken and surrounded me. The faces of these men were earthen in hue.
U||‚ÄúThen the first one whom I had seen and questioned on entering the town said to me:‚Äî
U||‚Äú‚ÄòWhither are you going! Do you not know that you have been dead this long time?‚Äô
U||‚ÄúI opened my mouth to reply, and I perceived that there was no one near me.‚Äù
U||He woke. He was icy cold. A wind which was chill like the breeze of dawn was rattling the leaves of the window, which had been left open on their hinges. The fire was out. The candle was nearing its end. It was still black night.
U||He rose, he went to the window. There were no stars in the sky even yet.
U||From his window the yard of the house and the street were visible. A sharp, harsh noise, which made him drop his eyes, resounded from the earth.
U||Below him he perceived two red stars, whose rays lengthened and shortened in a singular manner through the darkness.
U||As his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep, ‚ÄúHold!‚Äù said he, ‚Äúthere are no stars in the sky. They are on earth now.‚Äù
U||But this confusion vanished; a second sound similar to the first roused him thoroughly; he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars were the lanterns of a carriage. By the light which they cast he was able to distinguish the form of this vehicle. It was a tilbury harnessed to a small white horse. The noise which he had heard was the trampling of the horse‚Äôs hoofs on the pavement.
U||‚ÄúWhat vehicle is this?‚Äù he said to himself. ‚ÄúWho is coming here so early in the morning?‚Äù
U||At that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber.
U||He shuddered from head to foot, and cried in a terrible voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWho is there?‚Äù
U||Some one said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI, Monsieur le Maire.‚Äù
U||He recognized the voice of the old woman who was his portress.
U||‚ÄúWell!‚Äù he replied, ‚Äúwhat is it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMonsieur le Maire, it is just five o‚Äôclock in the morning.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is that to me?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe cabriolet is here, Monsieur le Maire.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat cabriolet?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe tilbury.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat tilbury?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDid not Monsieur le Maire order a tilbury?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said he.
U||‚ÄúThe coachman says that he has come for Monsieur le Maire.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat coachman?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúM. Scaufflaire‚Äôs coachman.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúM. Scaufflaire?‚Äù
U||That name sent a shudder over him, as though a flash of lightning had passed in front of his face.
U||‚ÄúAh! yes,‚Äù he resumed; ‚ÄúM. Scaufflaire!‚Äù
U||If the old woman could have seen him at that moment, she would have been frightened.
U||A tolerably long silence ensued. He examined the flame of the candle with a stupid air, and from around the wick he took some of the burning wax, which he rolled between his fingers. The old woman waited for him. She even ventured to uplift her voice once more:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat am I to say, Monsieur le Maire?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSay that it is well, and that I am coming down.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîHINDRANCES
U||The posting service from Arras to M. sur M. was still operated at this period by small mail-wagons of the time of the Empire. These mail-wagons were two-wheeled cabriolets, upholstered inside with fawn-colored leather, hung on springs, and having but two seats, one for the postboy, the other for the traveller. The wheels were armed with those long, offensive axles which keep other vehicles at a distance, and which may still be seen on the road in Germany. The despatch box, an immense oblong coffer, was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it. This coffer was painted black, and the cabriolet yellow.
U||These vehicles, which have no counterparts nowadays, had something distorted and hunchbacked about them; and when one saw them passing in the distance, and climbing up some road to the horizon, they resembled the insects which are called, I think, termites, and which, though with but little corselet, drag a great train behind them. But they travelled at a very rapid rate. The post-wagon which set out from Arras at one o‚Äôclock every night, after the mail from Paris had passed, arrived at M. sur M. a little before five o‚Äôclock in the morning.
U||That night the wagon which was descending to M. sur M. by the Hesdin road, collided at the corner of a street, just as it was entering the town, with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse, which was going in the opposite direction, and in which there was but one person, a man enveloped in a mantle. The wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent shock. The postman shouted to the man to stop, but the traveller paid no heed and pursued his road at full gallop.
U||‚ÄúThat man is in a devilish hurry!‚Äù said the postman.
U||The man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling in convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity.
U||Whither was he going? He could not have told. Why was he hastening? He did not know. He was driving at random, straight ahead. Whither? To Arras, no doubt; but he might have been going elsewhere as well. At times he was conscious of it, and he shuddered. He plunged into the night as into a gulf. Something urged him forward; something drew him on. No one could have told what was taking place within him; every one will understand it. What man is there who has not entered, at least once in his life, into that obscure cavern of the unknown?
U||However, he had resolved on nothing, decided nothing, formed no plan, done nothing. None of the actions of his conscience had been decisive. He was, more than ever, as he had been at the first moment.
U||Why was he going to Arras?
U||He repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hired Scaufflaire‚Äôs cabriolet: that, whatever the result was to be, there was no reason why he should not see with his own eyes, and judge of matters for himself; that this was even prudent; that he must know what took place; that no decision could be arrived at without having observed and scrutinized; that one made mountains out of everything from a distance; that, at any rate, when he should have seen that Champmathieu, some wretch, his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow him to go to the galleys in his stead; that Javert would indeed be there; and that Brevet, that Chenildieu, that Cochepaille, old convicts who had known him; but they certainly would not recognize him;‚Äîbah! what an idea! that Javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth; that all conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on Champmathieu, and that there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures; that accordingly there was no danger
U||.
U||That it was, no doubt, a dark moment, but that he should emerge from it; that, after all, he held his destiny, however bad it might be, in his own hand; that he was master of it. He clung to this thought.
U||At bottom, to tell the whole truth, he would have preferred not to go to Arras.
U||Nevertheless, he was going thither.
U||As he meditated, he whipped up his horse, which was proceeding at that fine, regular, and even trot which accomplishes two leagues and a half an hour.
U||In proportion as the cabriolet advanced, he felt something within him draw back.
U||At daybreak he was in the open country; the town of M. sur M. lay far behind him. He watched the horizon grow white; he stared at all the chilly figures of a winter‚Äôs dawn as they passed before his eyes, but without seeing them. The morning has its spectres as well as the evening. He did not see them; but without his being aware of it, and by means of a sort of penetration which was almost physical, these black silhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister quality to the violent state of his soul.
U||Each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which sometimes border on the highway, he said to himself, ‚ÄúAnd yet there are people there within who are sleeping!‚Äù
U||The trot of the horse, the bells on the harness, the wheels on the road, produced a gentle, monotonous noise. These things are charming when one is joyous, and lugubrious when one is sad.
U||It was broad daylight when he arrived at Hesdin. He halted in front of the inn, to allow the horse a breathing spell, and to have him given some oats.
U||The horse belonged, as Scaufflaire had said, to that small race of the Boulonnais, which has too much head, too much belly, and not enough neck and shoulders, but which has a broad chest, a large crupper, thin, fine legs, and solid hoofs‚Äîa homely, but a robust and healthy race. The excellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours, and had not a drop of sweat on his loins.
U||He did not get out of the tilbury. The stableman who brought the oats suddenly bent down and examined the left wheel.
U||‚ÄúAre you going far in this condition?‚Äù said the man.
U||He replied, with an air of not having roused himself from his reverie:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHave you come from a great distance?‚Äù went on the man.
U||‚ÄúFive leagues.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy do you say, ‚ÄòAh?‚Äô‚Äù
U||The man bent down once more, was silent for a moment, with his eyes fixed on the wheel; then he rose erect and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBecause, though this wheel has travelled five leagues, it certainly will not travel another quarter of a league.‚Äù
U||He sprang out of the tilbury.
U||‚ÄúWhat is that you say, my friend?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagues without you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway. Just see here!‚Äù
U||The wheel really had suffered serious damage. The shock administered by the mail-wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub, so that the nut no longer held firm.
U||‚ÄúMy friend,‚Äù he said to the stableman, ‚Äúis there a wheelwright here?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCertainly, sir.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDo me the service to go and fetch him.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe is only a step from here. Hey! Master Bourgaillard!‚Äù
U||Master Bourgaillard, the wheelwright, was standing on his own threshold. He came, examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken.
U||‚ÄúCan you repair this wheel immediately?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhen can I set out again?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo-morrow.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo-morrow!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThere is a long day‚Äôs work on it. Are you in a hurry, sir?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn a very great hurry. I must set out again in an hour at the latest.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúImpossible, sir.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will pay whatever you ask.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúImpossible.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell, in two hours, then.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúImpossible to-day. Two new spokes and a hub must be made. Monsieur will not be able to start before to-morrow morning.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe matter cannot wait until to-morrow. What if you were to replace this wheel instead of repairing it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are a wheelwright?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCertainly, sir.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHave you not a wheel that you can sell me? Then I could start again at once.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA spare wheel?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet. Two wheels make a pair. Two wheels cannot be put together hap-hazard.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn that case, sell me a pair of wheels.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNot all wheels fit all axles, sir.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTry, nevertheless.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt is useless, sir. I have nothing to sell but cart-wheels. We are but a poor country here.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHave you a cabriolet that you can let me have?‚Äù
U||The wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a hired vehicle. He shrugged his shoulders.
U||‚ÄúYou treat the cabriolets that people let you so well! If I had one, I would not let it to you!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell, sell it to me, then.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have none.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat! not even a spring-cart? I am not hard to please, as you see.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWe live in a poor country. There is, in truth,‚Äù added the wheelwright, ‚Äúan old calash under the shed yonder, which belongs to a bourgeois of the town, who gave it to me to take care of, and who only uses it on the thirty-sixth of the month‚Äînever, that is to say. I might let that to you, for what matters it to me? But the bourgeois must not see it pass‚Äîand then, it is a calash; it would require two horses.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will take two post-horses.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhere is Monsieur going?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo Arras.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd Monsieur wishes to reach there to-day?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, of course.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBy taking two post-horses?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDoes it make any difference whether Monsieur arrives at four o‚Äôclock to-morrow morning?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCertainly not.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThere is one thing to be said about that, you see, by taking post-horses‚ÄîMonsieur has his passport?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell, by taking post-horses, Monsieur cannot reach Arras before to-morrow. We are on a crossroad. The relays are badly served, the horses are in the fields. The season for ploughing is just beginning; heavy teams are required, and horses are seized upon everywhere, from the post as well as elsewhere. Monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least at every relay. And, then, they drive at a walk. There are many hills to ascend.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCome then, I will go on horseback. Unharness the cabriolet. Some one can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWithout doubt. But will this horse bear the saddle?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is true; you remind me of that; he will not bear it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThen‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut I can surely hire a horse in the village?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA horse to travel to Arras at one stretch?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts. You would have to buy it to begin with, because no one knows you. But you will not find one for sale nor to let, for five hundred francs, or for a thousand.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat am I to do?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man, and set out on your journey to-morrow.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo-morrow will be too late.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe deuce!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIs there not a mail-wagon which runs to Arras? When will it pass?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo-night. Both the posts pass at night; the one going as well as the one coming.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat! It will take you a day to mend this wheel?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA day, and a good long one.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIf you set two men to work?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIf I set ten men to work.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat could be done with the spokes, not with the hub; and the felly is in a bad state, too.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIs there any one in this village who lets out teams?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIs there another wheelwright?‚Äù
U||The stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert, with a toss of the head.
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||He felt an immense joy.
U||It was evident that Providence was intervening. That it was it who had broken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road. He had not yielded to this sort of first summons; he had just made every possible effort to continue the journey; he had loyally and scrupulously exhausted all means; he had been deterred neither by the season, nor fatigue, nor by the expense; he had nothing with which to reproach himself. If he went no further, that was no fault of his. It did not concern him further. It was no longer his fault. It was not the act of his own conscience, but the act of Providence.
U||He breathed again. He breathed freely and to the full extent of his lungs for the first time since Javert‚Äôs visit. It seemed to him that the hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty hours had just released him.
U||It seemed to him that God was for him now, and was manifesting Himself.
U||He said to himself that he had done all he could, and that now he had nothing to do but retrace his steps quietly.
U||If his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber of the inn, it would have had no witnesses, no one would have heard him, things would have rested there, and it is probable that we should not have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about to peruse; but this conversation had taken place in the street. Any colloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd. There are always people who ask nothing better than to become spectators. While he was questioning the wheelwright, some people who were passing back and forth halted around them. After listening for a few minutes, a young lad, to whom no one had paid any heed, detached himself from the group and ran off.
U||At the moment when the traveller, after the inward deliberation which we have just described, resolved to retrace his steps, this child returned. He was accompanied by an old woman.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur,‚Äù said the woman, ‚Äúmy boy tells me that you wish to hire a cabriolet.‚Äù
U||These simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the perspiration trickle down his limbs. He thought that he beheld the hand which had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him, ready to seize him once more.
U||He answered:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYes, my good woman; I am in search of a cabriolet which I can hire.‚Äù
U||And he hastened to add:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBut there is none in the place.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCertainly there is,‚Äù said the old woman.
U||‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù interpolated the wheelwright.
U||‚ÄúAt my house,‚Äù replied the old woman.
U||He shuddered. The fatal hand had grasped him again.
U||The old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring-cart. The wheelwright and the stable-man, in despair at the prospect of the traveller escaping their clutches, interfered.
U||‚ÄúIt was a frightful old trap; it rests flat on the axle; it is an actual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs; the rain came into it; the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture; it would not go much further than the tilbury; a regular ramshackle old stage-wagon; the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted himself to it,‚Äù etc., etc.
U||All this was true; but this trap, this ramshackle old vehicle, this thing, whatever it was, ran on its two wheels and could go to Arras.
U||He paid what was asked, left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be repaired, intending to reclaim it on his return, had the white horse put to the cart, climbed into it, and resumed the road which he had been travelling since morning.
U||At the moment when the cart moved off, he admitted that he had felt, a moment previously, a certain joy in the thought that he should not go whither he was now proceeding. He examined this joy with a sort of wrath, and found it absurd. Why should he feel joy at turning back? After all, he was taking this trip of his own free will. No one was forcing him to it.
U||And assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose.
U||As he left Hesdin, he heard a voice shouting to him: ‚ÄúStop! Stop!‚Äù He halted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and convulsive element resembling hope.
U||It was the old woman‚Äôs little boy.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur,‚Äù said the latter, ‚Äúit was I who got the cart for you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou have not given me anything.‚Äù
U||He who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almost odious.
U||‚ÄúAh! it‚Äôs you, you scamp?‚Äù said he; ‚Äúyou shall have nothing.‚Äù
U||He whipped up his horse and set off at full speed.
U||He had lost a great deal of time at Hesdin. He wanted to make it good. The little horse was courageous, and pulled for two; but it was the month of February, there had been rain; the roads were bad. And then, it was no longer the tilbury. The cart was very heavy, and in addition, there were many ascents.
U||He took nearly four hours to go from Hesdin to Saint-Pol; four hours for five leagues.
U||At Saint-Pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came to and led to the stable; as he had promised Scaufflaire, he stood beside the manger while the horse was eating; he thought of sad and confusing things.
U||The inn-keeper‚Äôs wife came to the stable.
U||‚ÄúDoes not Monsieur wish to breakfast?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCome, that is true; I even have a good appetite.‚Äù
U||He followed the woman, who had a rosy, cheerful face; she led him to the public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth.
U||‚ÄúMake haste!‚Äù said he; ‚ÄúI must start again; I am in a hurry.‚Äù
U||A big Flemish servant-maid placed his knife and fork in all haste; he looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort.
U||‚ÄúThat is what ailed me,‚Äù he thought; ‚ÄúI had not breakfasted.‚Äù
U||His breakfast was served; he seized the bread, took a mouthful, and then slowly replaced it on the table, and did not touch it again.
U||A carter was eating at another table; he said to this man:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhy is their bread so bitter here?‚Äù
U||The carter was a German and did not understand him.
U||He returned to the stable and remained near the horse.
U||An hour later he had quitted Saint-Pol and was directing his course towards Tinques, which is only five leagues from Arras.
U||What did he do during this journey? Of what was he thinking? As in the morning, he watched the trees, the thatched roofs, the tilled fields pass by, and the way in which the landscape, broken at every turn of the road, vanished; this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to the soul, and almost relieves it from thought. What is more melancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for the first and the last time? To travel is to be born and to die at every instant; perhaps, in the vaguest region of his mind, he did make comparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence: all the things of life are perpetually fleeing before us; the dark and bright intervals are intermingled; after a dazzling moment, an eclipse; we look, we hasten, we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing; each event is a turn in the road, and, all at once, we are old; we feel a shock; all is black; we distinguish an obscure door; the gloomy horse of life, which has been drawing us halts, and we
U|| see a veiled and unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows.
U||Twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school beheld this traveller enter Tinques; it is true that the days were still short; he did not halt at Tinques; as he emerged from the village, a laborer, who was mending the road with stones, raised his head and said to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat horse is very much fatigued.‚Äù
U||The poor beast was, in fact, going at a walk.
U||‚ÄúAre you going to Arras?‚Äù added the road-mender.
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIf you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early.‚Äù
U||He stopped his horse, and asked the laborer:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHow far is it from here to Arras?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNearly seven good leagues.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHow is that? the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù returned the road-mender, ‚Äúso you don‚Äôt know that the road is under repair? You will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on; there is no way to proceed further.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúReally?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou will take the road on the left, leading to Carency; you will cross the river; when you reach Camblin, you will turn to the right; that is the road to Mont-Saint-√âloy which leads to Arras.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut it is night, and I shall lose my way.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou do not belong in these parts?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd, besides, it is all crossroads; stop! sir,‚Äù resumed the road-mender; ‚Äúshall I give you a piece of advice? your horse is tired; return to Tinques; there is a good inn there; sleep there; you can reach Arras to-morrow.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI must be there this evening.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is different; but go to the inn all the same, and get an extra horse; the stable-boy will guide you through the crossroads.‚Äù
U||He followed the road-mender‚Äôs advice, retraced his steps, and, half an hour later, he passed the same spot again, but this time at full speed, with a good horse to aid; a stable-boy, who called himself a postilion, was seated on the shaft of the cariole.
U||Still, he felt that he had lost time.
U||Night had fully come.
U||They turned into the crossroad; the way became frightfully bad; the cart lurched from one rut to the other; he said to the postilion:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúKeep at a trot, and you shall have a double fee.‚Äù
U||In one of the jolts, the whiffle-tree broke.
U||‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the whiffle-tree broken, sir,‚Äù said the postilion; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to harness my horse now; this road is very bad at night; if you wish to return and sleep at Tinques, we could be in Arras early to-morrow morning.‚Äù
U||He replied, ‚ÄúHave you a bit of rope and a knife?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù
U||He cut a branch from a tree and made a whiffle-tree of it.
U||This caused another loss of twenty minutes; but they set out again at a gallop.
U||The plain was gloomy; low-hanging, black, crisp fogs crept over the hills and wrenched themselves away like smoke: there were whitish gleams in the clouds; a strong breeze which blew in from the sea produced a sound in all quarters of the horizon, as of some one moving furniture; everything that could be seen assumed attitudes of terror. How many things shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night!
U||He was stiff with cold; he had eaten nothing since the night before; he vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in the neighborhood of D‚Äî‚Äî, eight years previously, and it seemed but yesterday.
U||The hour struck from a distant tower; he asked the boy:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSeven o‚Äôclock, sir; we shall reach Arras at eight; we have but three leagues still to go.‚Äù
U||At that moment, he for the first time indulged in this reflection, thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner: that all this trouble which he was taking was, perhaps, useless; that he did not know so much as the hour of the trial; that he should, at least, have informed himself of that; that he was foolish to go thus straight ahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not; then he sketched out some calculations in his mind: that, ordinarily, the sittings of the Court of Assizes began at nine o‚Äôclock in the morning; that it could not be a long affair; that the theft of the apples would be very brief; that there would then remain only a question of identity, four or five depositions, and very little for the lawyers to say; that he should arrive after all was over.
U||The postilion whipped up the horses; they had crossed the river and left Mont-Saint-√âloy behind them.
U||The night grew more profound.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîSISTER SIMPLICE PUT TO THE PROOF
U||But at that moment Fantine was joyous.
U||She had passed a very bad night; her cough was frightful; her fever had doubled in intensity; she had had dreams: in the morning, when the doctor paid his visit, she was delirious; he assumed an alarmed look, and ordered that he should be informed as soon as M. Madeleine arrived.
U||All the morning she was melancholy, said but little, and laid plaits in her sheets, murmuring the while, in a low voice, calculations which seemed to be calculations of distances. Her eyes were hollow and staring. They seemed almost extinguished at intervals, then lighted up again and shone like stars. It seems as though, at the approach of a certain dark hour, the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the light of earth.
U||Each time that Sister Simplice asked her how she felt, she replied invariably, ‚ÄúWell. I should like to see M. Madeleine.‚Äù
U||Some months before this, at the moment when Fantine had just lost her last modesty, her last shame, and her last joy, she was the shadow of herself; now she was the spectre of herself. Physical suffering had completed the work of moral suffering. This creature of five and twenty had a wrinkled brow, flabby cheeks, pinched nostrils, teeth from which the gums had receded, a leaden complexion, a bony neck, prominent shoulder-blades, frail limbs, a clayey skin, and her golden hair was growing out sprinkled with gray. Alas! how illness improvises old-age!
U||At midday the physician returned, gave some directions, inquired whether the mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary, and shook his head.
U||M. Madeleine usually came to see the invalid at three o‚Äôclock. As exactness is kindness, he was exact.
U||About half-past two, Fantine began to be restless. In the course of twenty minutes, she asked the nun more than ten times, ‚ÄúWhat time is it, sister?‚Äù
U||Three o‚Äôclock struck. At the third stroke, Fantine sat up in bed; she who could, in general, hardly turn over, joined her yellow, fleshless hands in a sort of convulsive clasp, and the nun heard her utter one of those profound sighs which seem to throw off dejection. Then Fantine turned and looked at the door.
U||No one entered; the door did not open.
U||She remained thus for a quarter of an hour, her eyes riveted on the door, motionless and apparently holding her breath. The sister dared not speak to her. The clock struck a quarter past three. Fantine fell back on her pillow.
U||She said nothing, but began to plait the sheets once more.
U||Half an hour passed, then an hour, no one came; every time the clock struck, Fantine started up and looked towards the door, then fell back again.
U||Her thought was clearly perceptible, but she uttered no name, she made no complaint, she blamed no one. But she coughed in a melancholy way. One would have said that something dark was descending upon her. She was livid and her lips were blue. She smiled now and then.
U||Five o‚Äôclock struck. Then the sister heard her say, very low and gently, ‚ÄúHe is wrong not to come to-day, since I am going away to-morrow.‚Äù
U||Sister Simplice herself was surprised at M. Madeleine‚Äôs delay.
U||In the meantime, Fantine was staring at the tester of her bed. She seemed to be endeavoring to recall something. All at once she began to sing in a voice as feeble as a breath. The nun listened. This is what Fantine was singing:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLovely things we will buy
U||As we stroll the faubourgs through.
U||Roses are pink, corn-flowers are blue,
U||I love my love, corn-flowers are blue.
U||‚ÄúYestere‚Äôen the Virgin Mary came near my stove, in a broidered mantle clad, and said to me, ‚ÄòHere, hide ‚Äôneath my veil the child whom you one day begged from me. Haste to the city, buy linen, buy a needle, buy thread.‚Äô
U||‚ÄúLovely things we will buy
U||As we stroll the faubourgs through.
U||‚ÄúDear Holy Virgin, beside my stove I have set a cradle with ribbons decked. God may give me his loveliest star; I prefer the child thou hast granted me. ‚ÄòMadame, what shall I do with this linen fine?‚Äô‚Äî‚ÄòMake of it clothes for thy new-born babe.‚Äô
U||‚ÄúRoses are pink and corn-flowers are blue,
U||I love my love, and corn-flowers are blue.
U||‚Äú‚ÄòWash this linen.‚Äô‚Äî‚ÄòWhere?‚Äô‚Äî‚ÄòIn the stream. Make of it, soiling not, spoiling not, a petticoat fair with its bodice fine, which I will embroider and fill with flowers.‚Äô‚Äî‚ÄòMadame, the child is no longer here; what is to be done?‚Äô‚Äî‚ÄòThen make of it a winding-sheet in which to bury me.‚Äô
U||‚ÄúLovely things we will buy
U||As we stroll the faubourgs through,
U||Roses are pink, corn-flowers are blue,
U||I love my love, corn-flowers are blue.‚Äù
U||This song was an old cradle romance with which she had, in former days, lulled her little Cosette to sleep, and which had never recurred to her mind in all the five years during which she had been parted from her child. She sang it in so sad a voice, and to so sweet an air, that it was enough to make any one, even a nun, weep. The sister, accustomed as she was to austerities, felt a tear spring to her eyes.
U||The clock struck six. Fantine did not seem to hear it. She no longer seemed to pay attention to anything about her.
U||Sister Simplice sent a serving-maid to inquire of the portress of the factory, whether the mayor had returned, and if he would not come to the infirmary soon. The girl returned in a few minutes.
U||Fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts.
U||The servant informed Sister Simplice in a very low tone, that the mayor had set out that morning before six o‚Äôclock, in a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse, cold as the weather was; that he had gone alone, without even a driver; that no one knew what road he had taken; that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to Arras; that others asserted that they had met him on the road to Paris. That when he went away he had been very gentle, as usual, and that he had merely told the portress not to expect him that night.
U||While the two women were whispering together, with their backs turned to Fantine‚Äôs bed, the sister interrogating, the servant conjecturing, Fantine, with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies, which unite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of death, had raised herself to her knees in bed, with her shrivelled hands resting on the bolster, and her head thrust through the opening of the curtains, and was listening. All at once she cried:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou are speaking of M. Madeleine! Why are you talking so low? What is he doing? Why does he not come?‚Äù
U||Her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heard the voice of a man; they wheeled round in affright.
U||‚ÄúAnswer me!‚Äù cried Fantine.
U||The servant stammered:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe portress told me that he could not come to-day.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBe calm, my child,‚Äù said the sister; ‚Äúlie down again.‚Äù
U||Fantine, without changing her attitude, continued in a loud voice, and with an accent that was both imperious and heart-rending:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHe cannot come? Why not? You know the reason. You are whispering it to each other there. I want to know it.‚Äù
U||The servant-maid hastened to say in the nun‚Äôs ear, ‚ÄúSay that he is busy with the city council.‚Äù
U||Sister Simplice blushed faintly, for it was a lie that the maid had proposed to her.
U||On the other hand, it seemed to her that the mere communication of the truth to the invalid would, without doubt, deal her a terrible blow, and that this was a serious matter in Fantine‚Äôs present state. Her flush did not last long; the sister raised her calm, sad eyes to Fantine, and said, ‚ÄúMonsieur le Maire has gone away.‚Äù
U||Fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed: her eyes sparkled; indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face.
U||‚ÄúGone!‚Äù she cried; ‚Äúhe has gone to get Cosette.‚Äù
U||Then she raised her arms to heaven, and her white face became ineffable; her lips moved; she was praying in a low voice.
U||When her prayer was finished, ‚ÄúSister,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI am willing to lie down again; I will do anything you wish; I was naughty just now; I beg your pardon for having spoken so loud; it is very wrong to talk loudly; I know that well, my good sister, but, you see, I am very happy: the good God is good; M. Madeleine is good; just think! he has gone to Montfermeil to get my little Cosette.‚Äù
U||She lay down again, with the nun‚Äôs assistance, helped the nun to arrange her pillow, and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her neck, and which Sister Simplice had given her.
U||‚ÄúMy child,‚Äù said the sister, ‚Äútry to rest now, and do not talk any more.‚Äù
U||Fantine took the sister‚Äôs hand in her moist hands, and the latter was pained to feel that perspiration.
U||‚ÄúHe set out this morning for Paris; in fact, he need not even go through Paris; Montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence. Do you remember how he said to me yesterday, when I spoke to him of Cosette, Soon, soon? He wants to give me a surprise, you know! he made me sign a letter so that she could be taken from the Th√©nardiers; they cannot say anything, can they? they will give back Cosette, for they have been paid; the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they have received their pay. Do not make signs to me that I must not talk, sister! I am extremely happy; I am doing well; I am not ill at all any more; I am going to see Cosette again; I am even quite hungry; it is nearly five years since I saw her last; you cannot imagine how much attached one gets to children, and then, she will be so pretty; you will see! If you only knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had! In the first place, she will have very beautiful hands; she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old
U||; like this! she must be a big girl now; she is seven years old; she is quite a young lady; I call her Cosette, but her name is really Euphrasie. Stop! this morning I was looking at the dust on the chimney-piece, and I had a sort of idea come across me, like that, that I should see Cosette again soon. Mon Dieu! how wrong it is not to see one‚Äôs children for years! One ought to reflect that life is not eternal. Oh, how good M. le Maire is to go! it is very cold! it is true; he had on his cloak, at least? he will be here to-morrow, will he not? to-morrow will be a festival day; to-morrow morning, sister, you must remind me to put on my little cap that has lace on it. What a place that Montfermeil is! I took that journey on foot once; it was very long for me, but the diligences go very quickly! he will be here to-morrow with Cosette: how far is it from here to Montfermeil?‚Äù
U||The sister, who had no idea of distances, replied, ‚ÄúOh, I think that he will be here to-morrow.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo-morrow! to-morrow!‚Äù said Fantine, ‚ÄúI shall see Cosette to-morrow! you see, good sister of the good God, that I am no longer ill; I am mad; I could dance if any one wished it.‚Äù
U||A person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not have understood the change; she was all rosy now; she spoke in a lively and natural voice; her whole face was one smile; now and then she talked, she laughed softly; the joy of a mother is almost infantile.
U||‚ÄúWell,‚Äù resumed the nun, ‚Äúnow that you are happy, mind me, and do not talk any more.‚Äù
U||Fantine laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice: ‚ÄúYes, lie down again; be good, for you are going to have your child; Sister Simplice is right; every one here is right.‚Äù
U||And then, without stirring, without even moving her head, she began to stare all about her with wide-open eyes and a joyous air, and she said nothing more.
U||The sister drew the curtains together again, hoping that she would fall into a doze. Between seven and eight o‚Äôclock the doctor came; not hearing any sound, he thought Fantine was asleep, entered softly, and approached the bed on tiptoe; he opened the curtains a little, and, by the light of the taper, he saw Fantine‚Äôs big eyes gazing at him.
U||She said to him, ‚ÄúShe will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little bed, will she not, sir?‚Äù
U||The doctor thought that she was delirious. She added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSee! there is just room.‚Äù
U||The doctor took Sister Simplice aside, and she explained matters to him; that M. Madeleine was absent for a day or two, and that in their doubt they had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid, who believed that the mayor had gone to Montfermeil; that it was possible, after all, that her guess was correct: the doctor approved.
U||He returned to Fantine‚Äôs bed, and she went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou see, when she wakes up in the morning, I shall be able to say good morning to her, poor kitten, and when I cannot sleep at night, I can hear her asleep; her little gentle breathing will do me good.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGive me your hand,‚Äù said the doctor.
U||She stretched out her arm, and exclaimed with a laugh:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAh, hold! in truth, you did not know it; I am cured; Cosette will arrive to-morrow.‚Äù
U||The doctor was surprised; she was better; the pressure on her chest had decreased; her pulse had regained its strength; a sort of life had suddenly supervened and reanimated this poor, worn-out creature.
U||‚ÄúDoctor,‚Äù she went on, ‚Äúdid the sister tell you that M. le Maire has gone to get that mite of a child?‚Äù
U||The doctor recommended silence, and that all painful emotions should be avoided; he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona, and, in case the fever should increase again during the night, a calming potion. As he took his departure, he said to the sister:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúShe is doing better; if good luck willed that the mayor should actually arrive to-morrow with the child, who knows? there are crises so astounding; great joy has been known to arrest maladies; I know well that this is an organic disease, and in an advanced state, but all those things are such mysteries: we may be able to save her.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîTHE TRAVELLER ON HIS ARRIVAL TAKES PRECAUTIONS FOR DEPARTURE
U||It was nearly eight o‚Äôclock in the evening when the cart, which we left on the road, entered the porte-coch√®re of the Hotel de la Poste in Arras; the man whom we have been following up to this moment alighted from it, responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of the people of the inn, sent back the extra horse, and with his own hands led the little white horse to the stable; then he opened the door of a billiard-room which was situated on the ground floor, sat down there, and leaned his elbows on a table; he had taken fourteen hours for the journey which he had counted on making in six; he did himself the justice to acknowledge that it was not his fault, but at bottom, he was not sorry.
U||The landlady of the hotel entered.
U||‚ÄúDoes Monsieur wish a bed? Does Monsieur require supper?‚Äù
U||He made a sign of the head in the negative.
U||‚ÄúThe stableman says that Monsieur‚Äôs horse is extremely fatigued.‚Äù
U||Here he broke his silence.
U||‚ÄúWill not the horse be in a condition to set out again to-morrow morning?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOh, Monsieur! he must rest for two days at least.‚Äù
U||He inquired:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIs not the posting-station located here?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù
U||The hostess conducted him to the office; he showed his passport, and inquired whether there was any way of returning that same night to M. sur M. by the mail-wagon; the seat beside the post-boy chanced to be vacant; he engaged it and paid for it. ‚ÄúMonsieur,‚Äù said the clerk, ‚Äúdo not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o‚Äôclock in the morning.‚Äù
U||This done, he left the hotel and began to wander about the town.
U||He was not acquainted with Arras; the streets were dark, and he walked on at random; but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of the passers-by. He crossed the little river Crinchon, and found himself in a labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way. A citizen was passing along with a lantern. After some hesitation, he decided to apply to this man, not without having first glanced behind and in front of him, as though he feared lest some one should hear the question which he was about to put.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúwhere is the court-house, if you please.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou do not belong in town, sir?‚Äù replied the bourgeois, who was an oldish man; ‚Äúwell, follow me. I happen to be going in the direction of the court-house, that is to say, in the direction of the hotel of the prefecture; for the court-house is undergoing repairs just at this moment, and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the prefecture.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIs it there that the Assizes are held?‚Äù he asked.
U||‚ÄúCertainly, sir; you see, the prefecture of to-day was the bishop‚Äôs palace before the Revolution. M. de Conzi√©, who was bishop in ‚Äô82, built a grand hall there. It is in this grand hall that the court is held.‚Äù
U||On the way, the bourgeois said to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIf Monsieur desires to witness a case, it is rather late. The sittings generally close at six o‚Äôclock.‚Äù
U||When they arrived on the grand square, however, the man pointed out to him four long windows all lighted up, in the front of a vast and gloomy building.
U||‚ÄúUpon my word, sir, you are in luck; you have arrived in season. Do you see those four windows? That is the Court of Assizes. There is light there, so they are not through. The matter must have been greatly protracted, and they are holding an evening session. Do you take an interest in this affair? Is it a criminal case? Are you a witness?‚Äù
U||He replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI have not come on any business; I only wish to speak to one of the lawyers.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is different,‚Äù said the bourgeois. ‚ÄúStop, sir; here is the door where the sentry stands. You have only to ascend the grand staircase.‚Äù
U||He conformed to the bourgeois‚Äôs directions, and a few minutes later he was in a hall containing many people, and where groups, intermingled with lawyers in their gowns, were whispering together here and there.
U||It is always a heart-breaking thing to see these congregations of men robed in black, murmuring together in low voices, on the threshold of the halls of justice. It is rare that charity and pity are the outcome of these words. Condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely to be the result. All these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful observer so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concert all sorts of dark edifices.
U||This spacious hall, illuminated by a single lamp, was the old hall of the episcopal palace, and served as the large hall of the palace of justice. A double-leaved door, which was closed at that moment, separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting.
U||The obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer whom he met.
U||‚ÄúWhat stage have they reached, sir?‚Äù he asked.
U||‚ÄúIt is finished,‚Äù said the lawyer.
U||‚ÄúFinished!‚Äù
U||This word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round.
U||‚ÄúExcuse me sir; perhaps you are a relative?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo; I know no one here. Has judgment been pronounced?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOf course. Nothing else was possible.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo penal servitude?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFor life.‚Äù
U||He continued, in a voice so weak that it was barely audible:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThen his identity was established?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat identity?‚Äù replied the lawyer. ‚ÄúThere was no identity to be established. The matter was very simple. The woman had murdered her child; the infanticide was proved; the jury threw out the question of premeditation, and she was condemned for life.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSo it was a woman?‚Äù said he.
U||‚ÄúWhy, certainly. The Limosin woman. Of what are you speaking?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNothing. But since it is all over, how comes it that the hall is still lighted?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFor another case, which was begun about two hours ago.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat other case?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOh! this one is a clear case also. It is about a sort of blackguard; a man arrested for a second offence; a convict who has been guilty of theft. I don‚Äôt know his name exactly. There‚Äôs a bandit‚Äôs phiz for you! I‚Äôd send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIs there any way of getting into the court-room, sir?‚Äù said he.
U||‚ÄúI really think that there is not. There is a great crowd. However, the hearing has been suspended. Some people have gone out, and when the hearing is resumed, you might make an effort.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhere is the entrance?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThrough yonder large door.‚Äù
U||The lawyer left him. In the course of a few moments he had experienced, almost simultaneously, almost intermingled with each other, all possible emotions. The words of this indifferent spectator had, in turn, pierced his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire. When he saw that nothing was settled, he breathed freely once more; but he could not have told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure.
U||He drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying. The docket of the session was very heavy; the president had appointed for the same day two short and simple cases. They had begun with the infanticide, and now they had reached the convict, the old offender, the ‚Äúreturn horse.‚Äù This man had stolen apples, but that did not appear to be entirely proved; what had been proved was, that he had already been in the galleys at Toulon. It was that which lent a bad aspect to his case. However, the man‚Äôs examination and the depositions of the witnesses had been completed, but the lawyer‚Äôs plea, and the speech of the public prosecutor were still to come; it could not be finished before midnight. The man would probably be condemned; the attorney-general was very clever, and never missed his culprits; he was a brilliant fellow who wrote verses.
U||An usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the Assizes. He inquired of this usher:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWill the door be opened soon, sir?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt will not be opened at all,‚Äù replied the usher.
U||‚ÄúWhat! It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed? Is not the hearing suspended?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe hearing has just been begun again,‚Äù replied the usher, ‚Äúbut the door will not be opened again.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBecause the hall is full.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat! There is not room for one more?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNot another one. The door is closed. No one can enter now.‚Äù
U||The usher added after a pause: ‚ÄúThere are, to tell the truth, two or three extra places behind Monsieur le Pr√©sident, but Monsieur le Pr√©sident only admits public functionaries to them.‚Äù
U||So saying, the usher turned his back.
U||He retired with bowed head, traversed the antechamber, and slowly descended the stairs, as though hesitating at every step. It is probable that he was holding counsel with himself. The violent conflict which had been going on within him since the preceding evening was not yet ended; and every moment he encountered some new phase of it. On reaching the landing-place, he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his arms. All at once he opened his coat, drew out his pocket-book, took from it a pencil, tore out a leaf, and upon that leaf he wrote rapidly, by the light of the street lantern, this line: M. Madeleine, Mayor of M. sur M.; then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides, made his way through the crowd, walked straight up to the usher, handed him the paper, and said in an authoritative manner:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúTake this to Monsieur le Pr√©sident.‚Äù
U||The usher took the paper, cast a glance upon it, and obeyed.
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîAN ENTRANCE BY FAVOR
U||Although he did not suspect the fact, the mayor of M. sur M. enjoyed a sort of celebrity. For the space of seven years his reputation for virtue had filled the whole of Bas Boulonnais; it had eventually passed the confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through two or three neighboring departments. Besides the service which he had rendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry, there was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the arrondissement of M. sur M. which was not indebted to him for some benefit. He had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the industries of other arrondissements. It was thus that he had, when occasion offered, supported with his credit and his funds the linen factory at Boulogne, the flax-spinning industry at Fr√©vent, and the hydraulic manufacture of cloth at Boubers-sur-Canche. Everywhere the name of M. Madeleine was pronounced with veneration. Arras and Douai envied the happy little town of M. sur M. its mayor.
U||The Councillor of the Royal Court of Douai, who was presiding over this session of the Assizes at Arras, was acquainted, in common with the rest of the world, with this name which was so profoundly and universally honored. When the usher, discreetly opening the door which connected the council-chamber with the court-room, bent over the back of the President‚Äôs armchair and handed him the paper on which was inscribed the line which we have just perused, adding: ‚ÄúThe gentleman desires to be present at the trial,‚Äù the President, with a quick and deferential movement, seized a pen and wrote a few words at the bottom of the paper and returned it to the usher, saying, ‚ÄúAdmit him.‚Äù
U||The unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the door of the hall, in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher had left him. In the midst of his reverie he heard some one saying to him, ‚ÄúWill Monsieur do me the honor to follow me?‚Äù It was the same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously, and who was now bowing to the earth before him. At the same time, the usher handed him the paper. He unfolded it, and as he chanced to be near the light, he could read it.
U||‚ÄúThe President of the Court of Assizes presents his respects to M. Madeleine.‚Äù
U||He crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for him a strange and bitter aftertaste.
U||He followed the usher.
U||A few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscoted cabinet of severe aspect, lighted by two wax candles, placed upon a table with a green cloth. The last words of the usher who had just quitted him still rang in his ears: ‚ÄúMonsieur, you are now in the council-chamber; you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder door, and you will find yourself in the court-room, behind the President‚Äôs chair.‚Äù These words were mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory of narrow corridors and dark staircases which he had recently traversed.
U||The usher had left him alone. The supreme moment had arrived. He sought to collect his faculties, but could not. It is chiefly at the moment when there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painful realities of life, that the threads of thought snap within the brain. He was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned. With stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible apartment, where so many lives had been broken, which was soon to ring with his name, and which his fate was at that moment traversing. He stared at the wall, then he looked at himself, wondering that it should be that chamber and that it should be he.
U||He had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours; he was worn out by the jolts of the cart, but he was not conscious of it. It seemed to him that he felt nothing.
U||He approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall, and which contained, under glass, an ancient autograph letter of Jean Nicolas Pache, mayor of Paris and minister, and dated, through an error, no doubt, the 9th of June, of the year II., and in which Pache forwarded to the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by them. Any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment, and who had watched him, would have imagined, doubtless, that this letter struck him as very curious, for he did not take his eyes from it, and he read it two or three times. He read it without paying any attention to it, and unconsciously. He was thinking of Fantine and Cosette.
U||As he dreamed, he turned round, and his eyes fell upon the brass knob of the door which separated him from the Court of Assizes. He had almost forgotten that door. His glance, calm at first, paused there, remained fixed on that brass handle, then grew terrified, and little by little became impregnated with fear. Beads of perspiration burst forth among his hair and trickled down upon his temples.
U||At a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort of authority mingled with rebellion, which is intended to convey, and which does so well convey, ‚ÄúPardieu! who compels me to this?‚Äù Then he wheeled briskly round, caught sight of the door through which he had entered in front of him, went to it, opened it, and passed out. He was no longer in that chamber; he was outside in a corridor, a long, narrow corridor, broken by steps and gratings, making all sorts of angles, lighted here and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids, the corridor through which he had approached. He breathed, he listened; not a sound in front, not a sound behind him, and he fled as though pursued.
U||When he had turned many angles in this corridor, he still listened. The same silence reigned, and there was the same darkness around him. He was out of breath; he staggered; he leaned against the wall. The stone was cold; the perspiration lay ice-cold on his brow; he straightened himself up with a shiver.
U||Then, there alone in the darkness, trembling with cold and with something else, too, perchance, he meditated.
U||He had meditated all night long; he had meditated all the day: he heard within him but one voice, which said, ‚ÄúAlas!‚Äù
U||A quarter of an hour passed thus. At length he bowed his head, sighed with agony, dropped his arms, and retraced his steps. He walked slowly, and as though crushed. It seemed as though some one had overtaken him in his flight and was leading him back.
U||He re-entered the council-chamber. The first thing he caught sight of was the knob of the door. This knob, which was round and of polished brass, shone like a terrible star for him. He gazed at it as a lamb might gaze into the eye of a tiger.
U||He could not take his eyes from it. From time to time he advanced a step and approached the door.
U||Had he listened, he would have heard the sound of the adjoining hall like a sort of confused murmur; but he did not listen, and he did not hear.
U||Suddenly, without himself knowing how it happened, he found himself near the door; he grasped the knob convulsively; the door opened.
U||He was in the court-room.
U||CHAPTER IX‚ÄîA PLACE WHERE CONVICTIONS ARE IN PROCESS OF FORMATION
U||He advanced a pace, closed the door mechanically behind him, and remained standing, contemplating what he saw.
U||It was a vast and badly lighted apartment, now full of uproar, now full of silence, where all the apparatus of a criminal case, with its petty and mournful gravity in the midst of the throng, was in process of development.
U||At the one end of the hall, the one where he was, were judges, with abstracted air, in threadbare robes, who were gnawing their nails or closing their eyelids; at the other end, a ragged crowd; lawyers in all sorts of attitudes; soldiers with hard but honest faces; ancient, spotted woodwork, a dirty ceiling, tables covered with serge that was yellow rather than green; doors blackened by handmarks; tap-room lamps which emitted more smoke than light, suspended from nails in the wainscot; on the tables candles in brass candlesticks; darkness, ugliness, sadness; and from all this there was disengaged an austere and august impression, for one there felt that grand human thing which is called the law, and that grand divine thing which is called justice.
U||No one in all that throng paid any attention to him; all glances were directed towards a single point, a wooden bench placed against a small door, in the stretch of wall on the President‚Äôs left; on this bench, illuminated by several candles, sat a man between two gendarmes.
U||This man was the man.
U||He did not seek him; he saw him; his eyes went thither naturally, as though they had known beforehand where that figure was.
U||He thought he was looking at himself, grown old; not absolutely the same in face, of course, but exactly similar in attitude and aspect, with his bristling hair, with that wild and uneasy eye, with that blouse, just as it was on the day when he entered D‚Äî‚Äî, full of hatred, concealing his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which he had spent nineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison.
U||He said to himself with a shudder, ‚ÄúGood God! shall I become like that again?‚Äù
U||This creature seemed to be at least sixty; there was something indescribably coarse, stupid, and frightened about him.
U||At the sound made by the opening door, people had drawn aside to make way for him; the President had turned his head, and, understanding that the personage who had just entered was the mayor of M. sur M., he had bowed to him; the attorney-general, who had seen M. Madeleine at M. sur M., whither the duties of his office had called him more than once, recognized him and saluted him also: he had hardly perceived it; he was the victim of a sort of hallucination; he was watching.
U||Judges, clerks, gendarmes, a throng of cruelly curious heads, all these he had already beheld once, in days gone by, twenty-seven years before; he had encountered those fatal things once more; there they were; they moved; they existed; it was no longer an effort of his memory, a mirage of his thought; they were real gendarmes and real judges, a real crowd, and real men of flesh and blood: it was all over; he beheld the monstrous aspects of his past reappear and live once more around him, with all that there is formidable in reality.
U||All this was yawning before him.
U||He was horrified by it; he shut his eyes, and exclaimed in the deepest recesses of his soul, ‚ÄúNever!‚Äù
U||And by a tragic play of destiny which made all his ideas tremble, and rendered him nearly mad, it was another self of his that was there! all called that man who was being tried Jean Valjean.
U||Under his very eyes, unheard-of vision, he had a sort of representation of the most horrible moment of his life, enacted by his spectre.
U||Everything was there; the apparatus was the same, the hour of the night, the faces of the judges, of soldiers, and of spectators; all were the same, only above the President‚Äôs head there hung a crucifix, something which the courts had lacked at the time of his condemnation: God had been absent when he had been judged.
U||There was a chair behind him; he dropped into it, terrified at the thought that he might be seen; when he was seated, he took advantage of a pile of cardboard boxes, which stood on the judge‚Äôs desk, to conceal his face from the whole room; he could now see without being seen; he had fully regained consciousness of the reality of things; gradually he recovered; he attained that phase of composure where it is possible to listen.
U||M. Bamatabois was one of the jurors.
U||He looked for Javert, but did not see him; the seat of the witnesses was hidden from him by the clerk‚Äôs table, and then, as we have just said, the hall was sparely lighted.
U||At the moment of this entrance, the defendant‚Äôs lawyer had just finished his plea.
U||The attention of all was excited to the highest pitch; the affair had lasted for three hours: for three hours that crowd had been watching a strange man, a miserable specimen of humanity, either profoundly stupid or profoundly subtle, gradually bending beneath the weight of a terrible likeness. This man, as the reader already knows, was a vagabond who had been found in a field carrying a branch laden with ripe apples, broken in the orchard of a neighbor, called the Pierron orchard. Who was this man? an examination had been made; witnesses had been heard, and they were unanimous; light had abounded throughout the entire debate; the accusation said: ‚ÄúWe have in our grasp not only a marauder, a stealer of fruit; we have here, in our hands, a bandit, an old offender who has broken his ban, an ex-convict, a miscreant of the most dangerous description, a malefactor named Jean Valjean, whom justice has long been in search of, and who, eight years ago, on emerging from the galleys at Toulon, committed a highway ro
U||bbery, accompanied by violence, on the person of a child, a Savoyard named Little Gervais; a crime provided for by article 383 of the Penal Code, the right to try him for which we reserve hereafter, when his identity shall have been judicially established. He has just committed a fresh theft; it is a case of a second offence; condemn him for the fresh deed; later on he will be judged for the old crime.‚Äù In the face of this accusation, in the face of the unanimity of the witnesses, the accused appeared to be astonished more than anything else; he made signs and gestures which were meant to convey No, or else he stared at the ceiling: he spoke with difficulty, replied with embarrassment, but his whole person, from head to foot, was a denial; he was an idiot in the presence of all these minds ranged in order of battle around him, and like a stranger in the midst of this society which was seizing fast upon him; nevertheless, it was a question of the most menacing future for him; the likeness increased every mo
U||ment, and the entire crowd surveyed, with more anxiety than he did himself, that sentence freighted with calamity, which descended ever closer over his head; there was even a glimpse of a possibility afforded; besides the galleys, a possible death penalty, in case his identity were established, and the affair of Little Gervais were to end thereafter in condemnation. Who was this man? what was the nature of his apathy? was it imbecility or craft? Did he understand too well, or did he not understand at all? these were questions which divided the crowd, and seemed to divide the jury; there was something both terrible and puzzling in this case: the drama was not only melancholy; it was also obscure.
U||The counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well, in that provincial tongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar, and which was formerly employed by all advocates, at Paris as well as at Romorantin or at Montbrison, and which to-day, having become classic, is no longer spoken except by the official orators of magistracy, to whom it is suited on account of its grave sonorousness and its majestic stride; a tongue in which a husband is called a consort, and a woman a spouse; Paris, the centre of art and civilization; the king, the monarch; Monseigneur the Bishop, a sainted pontiff; the district-attorney, the eloquent interpreter of public prosecution; the arguments, the accents which we have just listened to; the age of Louis XIV., the grand age; a theatre, the temple of Melpomene; the reigning family, the august blood of our kings; a concert, a musical solemnity; the General Commandant of the province, the illustrious warrior, who, etc.; the pupils in the seminary, these tender levities; er
U||rors imputed to newspapers, the imposture which distills its venom through the columns of those organs; etc. The lawyer had, accordingly, begun with an explanation as to the theft of the apples,‚Äîan awkward matter couched in fine style; but B√©nigne Bossuet himself was obliged to allude to a chicken in the midst of a funeral oration, and he extricated himself from the situation in stately fashion. The lawyer established the fact that the theft of the apples had not been circumstantially proved. His client, whom he, in his character of counsel, persisted in calling Champmathieu, had not been seen scaling that wall nor breaking that branch by any one. He had been taken with that branch (which the lawyer preferred to call a bough) in his possession; but he said that he had found it broken off and lying on the ground, and had picked it up. Where was there any proof to the contrary? No doubt that branch had been broken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall, then thrown away by the alarmed marauder; the
U||re was no doubt that there had been a thief in the case. But what proof was there that that thief had been Champmathieu? One thing only. His character as an ex-convict. The lawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be, unhappily, well attested; the accused had resided at Faverolles; the accused had exercised the calling of a tree-pruner there; the name of Champmathieu might well have had its origin in Jean Mathieu; all that was true,‚Äîin short, four witnesses recognize Champmathieu, positively and without hesitation, as that convict, Jean Valjean; to these signs, to this testimony, the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his client, the denial of an interested party; but supposing that he was the convict Jean Valjean, did that prove that he was the thief of the apples? that was a presumption at the most, not a proof. The prisoner, it was true, and his counsel, ‚Äúin good faith,‚Äù was obliged to admit it, had adopted ‚Äúa bad system of defence.‚Äù He obstinately denied everything, the t
U||heft and his character of convict. An admission upon this last point would certainly have been better, and would have won for him the indulgence of his judges; the counsel had advised him to do this; but the accused had obstinately refused, thinking, no doubt, that he would save everything by admitting nothing. It was an error; but ought not the paucity of this intelligence to be taken into consideration? This man was visibly stupid. Long-continued wretchedness in the galleys, long misery outside the galleys, had brutalized him, etc. He defended himself badly; was that a reason for condemning him? As for the affair with Little Gervais, the counsel need not discuss it; it did not enter into the case. The lawyer wound up by beseeching the jury and the court, if the identity of Jean Valjean appeared to them to be evident, to apply to him the police penalties which are provided for a criminal who has broken his ban, and not the frightful chastisement which descends upon the convict guilty of a second offence.
U||The district-attorney answered the counsel for the defence. He was violent and florid, as district-attorneys usually are.
U||He congratulated the counsel for the defence on his ‚Äúloyalty,‚Äù and skilfully took advantage of this loyalty. He reached the accused through all the concessions made by his lawyer. The advocate had seemed to admit that the prisoner was Jean Valjean. He took note of this. So this man was Jean Valjean. This point had been conceded to the accusation and could no longer be disputed. Here, by means of a clever autonomasia which went back to the sources and causes of crime, the district-attorney thundered against the immorality of the romantic school, then dawning under the name of the Satanic school, which had been bestowed upon it by the critics of the Quotidienne and the Oriflamme; he attributed, not without some probability, to the influence of this perverse literature the crime of Champmathieu, or rather, to speak more correctly, of Jean Valjean. Having exhausted these considerations, he passed on to Jean Valjean himself. Who was this Jean Valjean? Description of Jean Valjean: a monster spewed forth, etc. 
U||The model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of Th√©ram√®ne, which is not useful to tragedy, but which every day renders great services to judicial eloquence. The audience and the jury ‚Äúshuddered.‚Äù The description finished, the district-attorney resumed with an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the journal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day: And it is such a man, etc., etc., etc., vagabond, beggar, without means of existence, etc., etc., inured by his past life to culpable deeds, and but little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys, as was proved by the crime committed against Little Gervais, etc., etc.; it is such a man, caught upon the highway in the very act of theft, a few paces from a wall that had been scaled, still holding in his hand the object stolen, who denies the crime, the theft, the climbing the wall; denies everything; denies even his own identity! In addition to a hundred other proofs, to which we will not recur, four witnes
U||ses recognize him‚ÄîJavert, the upright inspector of police; Javert, and three of his former companions in infamy, the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu, and Cochepaille. What does he offer in opposition to this overwhelming unanimity? His denial. What obduracy! You will do justice, gentlemen of the jury, etc., etc. While the district-attorney was speaking, the accused listened to him open-mouthed, with a sort of amazement in which some admiration was assuredly blended. He was evidently surprised that a man could talk like that. From time to time, at those ‚Äúenergetic‚Äù moments of the prosecutor‚Äôs speech, when eloquence which cannot contain itself overflows in a flood of withering epithets and envelops the accused like a storm, he moved his head slowly from right to left and from left to right in the sort of mute and melancholy protest with which he had contented himself since the beginning of the argument. Two or three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say in a low voice, ‚ÄúThat is what 
U||comes of not having asked M. Baloup.‚Äù The district-attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupid attitude, evidently deliberate, which denoted not imbecility, but craft, skill, a habit of deceiving justice, and which set forth in all its nakedness the ‚Äúprofound perversity‚Äù of this man. He ended by making his reserves on the affair of Little Gervais and demanding a severe sentence.
U||At that time, as the reader will remember, it was penal servitude for life.
U||The counsel for the defence rose, began by complimenting Monsieur l‚ÄôAvocat-General on his ‚Äúadmirable speech,‚Äù then replied as best he could; but he weakened; the ground was evidently slipping away from under his feet.
U||CHAPTER X‚ÄîTHE SYSTEM OF DENIALS
U||The moment for closing the debate had arrived. The President had the accused stand up, and addressed to him the customary question, ‚ÄúHave you anything to add to your defence?‚Äù
U||The man did not appear to understand, as he stood there, twisting in his hands a terrible cap which he had.
U||The President repeated the question.
U||This time the man heard it. He seemed to understand. He made a motion like a man who is just waking up, cast his eyes about him, stared at the audience, the gendarmes, his counsel, the jury, the court, laid his monstrous fist on the rim of woodwork in front of his bench, took another look, and all at once, fixing his glance upon the district-attorney, he began to speak. It was like an eruption. It seemed, from the manner in which the words escaped from his mouth,‚Äîincoherent, impetuous, pell-mell, tumbling over each other,‚Äîas though they were all pressing forward to issue forth at once. He said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThis is what I have to say. That I have been a wheelwright in Paris, and that it was with Monsieur Baloup. It is a hard trade. In the wheelwright‚Äôs trade one works always in the open air, in courtyards, under sheds when the masters are good, never in closed workshops, because space is required, you see. In winter one gets so cold that one beats one‚Äôs arms together to warm one‚Äôs self; but the masters don‚Äôt like it; they say it wastes time. Handling iron when there is ice between the paving-stones is hard work. That wears a man out quickly. One is old while he is still quite young in that trade. At forty a man is done for. I was fifty-three. I was in a bad state. And then, workmen are so mean! When a man is no longer young, they call him nothing but an old bird, old beast! I was not earning more than thirty sous a day. They paid me as little as possible. The masters took advantage of my age‚Äîand then I had my daughter, who was a laundress at the river. She earned a little also. It sufficed for us t
U||wo. She had trouble, also; all day long up to her waist in a tub, in rain, in snow. When the wind cuts your face, when it freezes, it is all the same; you must still wash. There are people who have not much linen, and wait until late; if you do not wash, you lose your custom. The planks are badly joined, and water drops on you from everywhere; you have your petticoats all damp above and below. That penetrates. She has also worked at the laundry of the Enfants-Rouges, where the water comes through faucets. You are not in the tub there; you wash at the faucet in front of you, and rinse in a basin behind you. As it is enclosed, you are not so cold; but there is that hot steam, which is terrible, and which ruins your eyes. She came home at seven o‚Äôclock in the evening, and went to bed at once, she was so tired. Her husband beat her. She is dead. We have not been very happy. She was a good girl, who did not go to the ball, and who was very peaceable. I remember one Shrove-Tuesday when she went to bed at eight o
U||‚Äôclock. There, I am telling the truth; you have only to ask. Ah, yes! how stupid I am! Paris is a gulf. Who knows Father Champmathieu there? But M. Baloup does, I tell you. Go see at M. Baloup‚Äôs; and after all, I don‚Äôt know what is wanted of me.‚Äù
U||The man ceased speaking, and remained standing. He had said these things in a loud, rapid, hoarse voice, with a sort of irritated and savage ingenuousness. Once he paused to salute some one in the crowd. The sort of affirmations which he seemed to fling out before him at random came like hiccoughs, and to each he added the gesture of a wood-cutter who is splitting wood. When he had finished, the audience burst into a laugh. He stared at the public, and, perceiving that they were laughing, and not understanding why, he began to laugh himself.
U||It was inauspicious.
U||The President, an attentive and benevolent man, raised his voice.
U||He reminded ‚Äúthe gentlemen of the jury‚Äù that ‚Äúthe sieur Baloup, formerly a master-wheelwright, with whom the accused stated that he had served, had been summoned in vain. He had become bankrupt, and was not to be found.‚Äù Then turning to the accused, he enjoined him to listen to what he was about to say, and added: ‚ÄúYou are in a position where reflection is necessary. The gravest presumptions rest upon you, and may induce vital results. Prisoner, in your own interests, I summon you for the last time to explain yourself clearly on two points. In the first place, did you or did you not climb the wall of the Pierron orchard, break the branch, and steal the apples; that is to say, commit the crime of breaking in and theft? In the second place, are you the discharged convict, Jean Valjean‚Äîyes or no?‚Äù
U||The prisoner shook his head with a capable air, like a man who has thoroughly understood, and who knows what answer he is going to make. He opened his mouth, turned towards the President, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIn the first place‚Äî‚Äù
U||Then he stared at his cap, stared at the ceiling, and held his peace.
U||‚ÄúPrisoner,‚Äù said the district-attorney, in a severe voice; ‚Äúpay attention. You are not answering anything that has been asked of you. Your embarrassment condemns you. It is evident that your name is not Champmathieu; that you are the convict, Jean Valjean, concealed first under the name of Jean Mathieu, which was the name of his mother; that you went to Auvergne; that you were born at Faverolles, where you were a pruner of trees. It is evident that you have been guilty of entering, and of the theft of ripe apples from the Pierron orchard. The gentlemen of the jury will form their own opinion.‚Äù
U||Father Champmathieu on Trial
U||The prisoner had finally resumed his seat; he arose abruptly when the district-attorney had finished, and exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou are very wicked; that you are! This what I wanted to say; I could not find words for it at first. I have stolen nothing. I am a man who does not have something to eat every day. I was coming from Ailly; I was walking through the country after a shower, which had made the whole country yellow: even the ponds were overflowed, and nothing sprang from the sand any more but the little blades of grass at the wayside. I found a broken branch with apples on the ground; I picked up the branch without knowing that it would get me into trouble. I have been in prison, and they have been dragging me about for the last three months; more than that I cannot say; people talk against me, they tell me, ‚ÄòAnswer!‚Äô The gendarme, who is a good fellow, nudges my elbow, and says to me in a low voice, ‚ÄòCome, answer!‚Äô I don‚Äôt know how to explain; I have no education; I am a poor man; that is where they wrong me, because they do not see this. I have not stolen; I picked up from the ground things that were lying there.
U|| You say, Jean Valjean, Jean Mathieu! I don‚Äôt know those persons; they are villagers. I worked for M. Baloup, Boulevard de l‚ÄôH√¥pital; my name is Champmathieu. You are very clever to tell me where I was born; I don‚Äôt know myself: it‚Äôs not everybody who has a house in which to come into the world; that would be too convenient. I think that my father and mother were people who strolled along the highways; I know nothing different. When I was a child, they called me young fellow; now they call me old Fellow; those are my baptismal names; take that as you like. I have been in Auvergne; I have been at Faverolles. Pardi. Well! can‚Äôt a man have been in Auvergne, or at Faverolles, without having been in the galleys? I tell you that I have not stolen, and that I am Father Champmathieu; I have been with M. Baloup; I have had a settled residence. You worry me with your nonsense, there! Why is everybody pursuing me so furiously?‚Äù
U||The district-attorney had remained standing; he addressed the President:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur le Pr√©sident, in view of the confused but exceedingly clever denials of the prisoner, who would like to pass himself off as an idiot, but who will not succeed in so doing,‚Äîwe shall attend to that,‚Äîwe demand that it shall please you and that it shall please the court to summon once more into this place the convicts Brevet, Cochepaille, and Chenildieu, and Police-Inspector Javert, and question them for the last time as to the identity of the prisoner with the convict Jean Valjean.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI would remind the district-attorney,‚Äù said the President, ‚Äúthat Police-Inspector Javert, recalled by his duties to the capital of a neighboring arrondissement, left the court-room and the town as soon as he had made his deposition; we have accorded him permission, with the consent of the district-attorney and of the counsel for the prisoner.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is true, Mr. President,‚Äù responded the district-attorney. ‚ÄúIn the absence of sieur Javert, I think it my duty to remind the gentlemen of the jury of what he said here a few hours ago. Javert is an estimable man, who does honor by his rigorous and strict probity to inferior but important functions. These are the terms of his deposition: ‚ÄòI do not even stand in need of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions to give the lie to the prisoner‚Äôs denial. I recognize him perfectly. The name of this man is not Champmathieu; he is an ex-convict named Jean Valjean, and is very vicious and much to be feared. It is only with extreme regret that he was released at the expiration of his term. He underwent nineteen years of penal servitude for theft. He made five or six attempts to escape. Besides the theft from Little Gervais, and from the Pierron orchard, I suspect him of a theft committed in the house of His Grace the late Bishop of D‚Äî‚Äî I often saw him at the time when I was adjutant of the galle
U||y-guard at the prison in Toulon. I repeat that I recognize him perfectly.‚Äô‚Äù
U||This extremely precise statement appeared to produce a vivid impression on the public and on the jury. The district-attorney concluded by insisting, that in default of Javert, the three witnesses Brevet, Chenildieu, and Cochepaille should be heard once more and solemnly interrogated.
U||The President transmitted the order to an usher, and, a moment later, the door of the witnesses‚Äô room opened. The usher, accompanied by a gendarme ready to lend him armed assistance, introduced the convict Brevet. The audience was in suspense; and all breasts heaved as though they had contained but one soul.
U||The ex-convict Brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the central prisons. Brevet was a person sixty years of age, who had a sort of business man‚Äôs face, and the air of a rascal. The two sometimes go together. In prison, whither fresh misdeeds had led him, he had become something in the nature of a turnkey. He was a man of whom his superiors said, ‚ÄúHe tries to make himself of use.‚Äù The chaplains bore good testimony as to his religious habits. It must not be forgotten that this passed under the Restoration.
U||‚ÄúBrevet,‚Äù said the President, ‚Äúyou have undergone an ignominious sentence, and you cannot take an oath.‚Äù
U||Brevet dropped his eyes.
U||‚ÄúNevertheless,‚Äù continued the President, ‚Äúeven in the man whom the law has degraded, there may remain, when the divine mercy permits it, a sentiment of honor and of equity. It is to this sentiment that I appeal at this decisive hour. If it still exists in you,‚Äîand I hope it does,‚Äîreflect before replying to me: consider on the one hand, this man, whom a word from you may ruin; on the other hand, justice, which a word from you may enlighten. The instant is solemn; there is still time to retract if you think you have been mistaken. Rise, prisoner. Brevet, take a good look at the accused, recall your souvenirs, and tell us on your soul and conscience, if you persist in recognizing this man as your former companion in the galleys, Jean Valjean?‚Äù
U||Brevet looked at the prisoner, then turned towards the court.
U||‚ÄúYes, Mr. President, I was the first to recognize him, and I stick to it; that man is Jean Valjean, who entered at Toulon in 1796, and left in 1815. I left a year later. He has the air of a brute now; but it must be because age has brutalized him; he was sly at the galleys: I recognize him positively.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTake your seat,‚Äù said the President. ‚ÄúPrisoner, remain standing.‚Äù
U||Chenildieu was brought in, a prisoner for life, as was indicated by his red cassock and his green cap. He was serving out his sentence at the galleys of Toulon, whence he had been brought for this case. He was a small man of about fifty, brisk, wrinkled, frail, yellow, brazen-faced, feverish, who had a sort of sickly feebleness about all his limbs and his whole person, and an immense force in his glance. His companions in the galleys had nicknamed him I-deny-God (Je-nie Dieu, Chenildieu).
U||The President addressed him in nearly the same words which he had used to Brevet. At the moment when he reminded him of his infamy which deprived him of the right to take an oath, Chenildieu raised his head and looked the crowd in the face. The President invited him to reflection, and asked him as he had asked Brevet, if he persisted in recognition of the prisoner.
U||Chenildieu burst out laughing.
U||‚ÄúPardieu, as if I didn‚Äôt recognize him! We were attached to the same chain for five years. So you are sulking, old fellow?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGo take your seat,‚Äù said the President.
U||The usher brought in Cochepaille. He was another convict for life, who had come from the galleys, and was dressed in red, like Chenildieu, was a peasant from Lourdes, and a half-bear of the Pyrenees. He had guarded the flocks among the mountains, and from a shepherd he had slipped into a brigand. Cochepaille was no less savage and seemed even more stupid than the prisoner. He was one of those wretched men whom nature has sketched out for wild beasts, and on whom society puts the finishing touches as convicts in the galleys.
U||The President tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words, and asked him, as he had asked the other two, if he persisted, without hesitation or trouble, in recognizing the man who was standing before him.
U||‚ÄúHe is Jean Valjean,‚Äù said Cochepaille. ‚ÄúHe was even called Jean-the-Screw, because he was so strong.‚Äù
U||Each of these affirmations from these three men, evidently sincere and in good faith, had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for the prisoner,‚Äîa murmur which increased and lasted longer each time that a fresh declaration was added to the proceeding.
U||The prisoner had listened to them, with that astounded face which was, according to the accusation, his principal means of defence; at the first, the gendarmes, his neighbors, had heard him mutter between his teeth: ‚ÄúAh, well, he‚Äôs a nice one!‚Äù after the second, he said, a little louder, with an air that was almost that of satisfaction, ‚ÄúGood!‚Äù at the third, he cried, ‚ÄúFamous!‚Äù
U||The President addressed him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHave you heard, prisoner? What have you to say?‚Äù
U||He replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI say, ‚ÄòFamous!‚Äô‚Äù
U||An uproar broke out among the audience, and was communicated to the jury; it was evident that the man was lost.
U||‚ÄúUshers,‚Äù said the President, ‚Äúenforce silence! I am going to sum up the arguments.‚Äù
U||At that moment there was a movement just beside the President; a voice was heard crying:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBrevet! Chenildieu! Cochepaille! look here!‚Äù
U||All who heard that voice were chilled, so lamentable and terrible was it; all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded. A man, placed among the privileged spectators who were seated behind the court, had just risen, had pushed open the half-door which separated the tribunal from the audience, and was standing in the middle of the hall; the President, the district-attorney, M. Bamatabois, twenty persons, recognized him, and exclaimed in concert:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúM. Madeleine!‚Äù
U||CHAPTER XI‚ÄîCHAMPMATHIEU MORE AND MORE ASTONISHED
U||It was he, in fact. The clerk‚Äôs lamp illumined his countenance. He held his hat in his hand; there was no disorder in his clothing; his coat was carefully buttoned; he was very pale, and he trembled slightly; his hair, which had still been gray on his arrival in Arras, was now entirely white: it had turned white during the hour he had sat there.
U||All heads were raised: the sensation was indescribable; there was a momentary hesitation in the audience, the voice had been so heart-rending; the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did not understand at first. They asked themselves whether he had indeed uttered that cry; they could not believe that that tranquil man had been the one to give that terrible outcry.
U||This indecision only lasted a few seconds. Even before the President and the district-attorney could utter a word, before the ushers and the gendarmes could make a gesture, the man whom all still called, at that moment, M. Madeleine, had advanced towards the witnesses Cochepaille, Brevet, and Chenildieu.
U||‚ÄúDo you not recognize me?‚Äù said he.
U||All three remained speechless, and indicated by a sign of the head that they did not know him. Cochepaille, who was intimidated, made a military salute. M. Madeleine turned towards the jury and the court, and said in a gentle voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGentlemen of the jury, order the prisoner to be released! Mr. President, have me arrested. He is not the man whom you are in search of; it is I: I am Jean Valjean.‚Äù
U||Not a mouth breathed; the first commotion of astonishment had been followed by a silence like that of the grave; those within the hall experienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses when something grand has been done.
U||In the meantime, the face of the President was stamped with sympathy and sadness; he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district-attorney and a few low-toned words with the assistant judges; he addressed the public, and asked in accents which all understood:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIs there a physician present?‚Äù
U||The district-attorney took the word:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGentlemen of the jury, the very strange and unexpected incident which disturbs the audience inspires us, like yourselves, only with a sentiment which it is unnecessary for us to express. You all know, by reputation at least, the honorable M. Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M.; if there is a physician in the audience, we join the President in requesting him to attend to M. Madeleine, and to conduct him to his home.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine did not allow the district-attorney to finish; he interrupted him in accents full of suavity and authority. These are the words which he uttered; here they are literally, as they were written down, immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this scene, and as they now ring in the ears of those who heard them nearly forty years ago:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI thank you, Mr. District-Attorney, but I am not mad; you shall see; you were on the point of committing a great error; release this man! I am fulfilling a duty; I am that miserable criminal. I am the only one here who sees the matter clearly, and I am telling you the truth. God, who is on high, looks down on what I am doing at this moment, and that suffices. You can take me, for here I am: but I have done my best; I concealed myself under another name; I have become rich; I have become a mayor; I have tried to re-enter the ranks of the honest. It seems that that is not to be done. In short, there are many things which I cannot tell. I will not narrate the story of my life to you; you will hear it one of these days. I robbed Monseigneur the Bishop, it is true; it is true that I robbed Little Gervais; they were right in telling you that Jean Valjean was a very vicious wretch. Perhaps it was not altogether his fault. Listen, honorable judges! a man who has been so greatly humbled as I have has neither any r
U||emonstrances to make to Providence, nor any advice to give to society; but, you see, the infamy from which I have tried to escape is an injurious thing; the galleys make the convict what he is; reflect upon that, if you please. Before going to the galleys, I was a poor peasant, with very little intelligence, a sort of idiot; the galleys wrought a change in me. I was stupid; I became vicious: I was a block of wood; I became a firebrand. Later on, indulgence and kindness saved me, as severity had ruined me. But, pardon me, you cannot understand what I am saying. You will find at my house, among the ashes in the fireplace, the forty-sou piece which I stole, seven years ago, from Little Gervais. I have nothing farther to add; take me. Good God! the district-attorney shakes his head; you say, ‚ÄòM. Madeleine has gone mad!‚Äô you do not believe me! that is distressing. Do not, at least, condemn this man! What! these men do not recognize me! I wish Javert were here; he would recognize me.‚Äù
U||Nothing can reproduce the sombre and kindly melancholy of tone which accompanied these words.
U||He turned to the three convicts, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWell, I recognize you; do you remember, Brevet?‚Äù
U||He paused, hesitated for an instant, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDo you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern which you wore in the galleys?‚Äù
U||Brevet gave a start of surprise, and surveyed him from head to foot with a frightened air. He continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúChenildieu, you who conferred on yourself the name of ‚ÄòJenie-Dieu,‚Äô your whole right shoulder bears a deep burn, because you one day laid your shoulder against the chafing-dish full of coals, in order to efface the three letters T. F. P., which are still visible, nevertheless; answer, is this true?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt is true,‚Äù said Chenildieu.
U||He addressed himself to Cochepaille:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCochepaille, you have, near the bend in your left arm, a date stamped in blue letters with burnt powder; the date is that of the landing of the Emperor at Cannes, March 1, 1815; pull up your sleeve!‚Äù
U||Cochepaille pushed up his sleeve; all eyes were focused on him and on his bare arm.
U||A gendarme held a light close to it; there was the date.
U||The unhappy man turned to the spectators and the judges with a smile which still rends the hearts of all who saw it whenever they think of it. It was a smile of triumph; it was also a smile of despair.
U||‚ÄúYou see plainly,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthat I am Jean Valjean.‚Äù
U||In that chamber there were no longer either judges, accusers, nor gendarmes; there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts. No one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to play; the district-attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of prosecuting, the President that he was there to preside, the counsel for the defence that he was there to defend. It was a striking circumstance that no question was put, that no authority intervened. The peculiarity of sublime spectacles is, that they capture all souls and turn witnesses into spectators. No one, probably, could have explained what he felt; no one, probably, said to himself that he was witnessing the splendid outburst of a grand light: all felt themselves inwardly dazzled.
U||It was evident that they had Jean Valjean before their eyes. That was clear. The appearance of this man had sufficed to suffuse with light that matter which had been so obscure but a moment previously, without any further explanation: the whole crowd, as by a sort of electric revelation, understood instantly and at a single glance the simple and magnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up so that another man might not be condemned in his stead. The details, the hesitations, little possible oppositions, were swallowed up in that vast and luminous fact.
U||It was an impression which vanished speedily, but which was irresistible at the moment.
U||‚ÄúI do not wish to disturb the court further,‚Äù resumed Jean Valjean. ‚ÄúI shall withdraw, since you do not arrest me. I have many things to do. The district-attorney knows who I am; he knows whither I am going; he can have me arrested when he likes.‚Äù
U||He directed his steps towards the door. Not a voice was raised, not an arm extended to hinder him. All stood aside. At that moment there was about him that divine something which causes multitudes to stand aside and make way for a man. He traversed the crowd slowly. It was never known who opened the door, but it is certain that he found the door open when he reached it. On arriving there he turned round and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am at your command, Mr. District-Attorney.‚Äù
U||Then he addressed the audience:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAll of you, all who are present‚Äîconsider me worthy of pity, do you not? Good God! When I think of what I was on the point of doing, I consider that I am to be envied. Nevertheless, I should have preferred not to have had this occur.‚Äù
U||He withdrew, and the door closed behind him as it had opened, for those who do certain sovereign things are always sure of being served by some one in the crowd.
U||Less than an hour after this, the verdict of the jury freed the said Champmathieu from all accusations; and Champmathieu, being at once released, went off in a state of stupefaction, thinking that all men were fools, and comprehending nothing of this vision.
U||BOOK EIGHTH‚ÄîA COUNTER-BLOW
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîIN WHAT MIRROR M. MADELEINE CONTEMPLATES HIS HAIR
U||The day had begun to dawn. Fantine had passed a sleepless and feverish night, filled with happy visions; at daybreak she fell asleep. Sister Simplice, who had been watching with her, availed herself of this slumber to go and prepare a new potion of chinchona. The worthy sister had been in the laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments, bending over her drugs and phials, and scrutinizing things very closely, on account of the dimness which the half-light of dawn spreads over all objects. Suddenly she raised her head and uttered a faint shriek. M. Madeleine stood before her; he had just entered silently.
U||‚ÄúIs it you, Mr. Mayor?‚Äù she exclaimed.
U||He replied in a low voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHow is that poor woman?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNot so bad just now; but we have been very uneasy.‚Äù
U||She explained to him what had passed: that Fantine had been very ill the day before, and that she was better now, because she thought that the mayor had gone to Montfermeil to get her child. The sister dared not question the mayor; but she perceived plainly from his air that he had not come from there.
U||‚ÄúAll that is good,‚Äù said he; ‚Äúyou were right not to undeceive her.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù responded the sister; ‚Äúbut now, Mr. Mayor, she will see you and will not see her child. What shall we say to her?‚Äù
U||He reflected for a moment.
U||‚ÄúGod will inspire us,‚Äù said he.
U||‚ÄúBut we cannot tell a lie,‚Äù murmured the sister, half aloud.
U||It was broad daylight in the room. The light fell full on M. Madeleine‚Äôs face. The sister chanced to raise her eyes to it.
U||‚ÄúGood God, sir!‚Äù she exclaimed; ‚Äúwhat has happened to you? Your hair is perfectly white!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhite!‚Äù said he.
U||Sister Simplice had no mirror. She rummaged in a drawer, and pulled out the little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whether a patient was dead and whether he no longer breathed. M. Madeleine took the mirror, looked at his hair, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWell!‚Äù
U||He uttered the word indifferently, and as though his mind were on something else.
U||The sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught a glimpse in all this.
U||He inquired:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCan I see her?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIs not Monsieur le Maire going to have her child brought back to her?‚Äù said the sister, hardly venturing to put the question.
U||‚ÄúOf course; but it will take two or three days at least.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIf she were not to see Monsieur le Maire until that time,‚Äù went on the sister, timidly, ‚Äúshe would not know that Monsieur le Maire had returned, and it would be easy to inspire her with patience; and when the child arrived, she would naturally think Monsieur le Maire had just come with the child. We should not have to enact a lie.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments; then he said with his calm gravity:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúNo, sister, I must see her. I may, perhaps, be in haste.‚Äù
U||The nun did not appear to notice this word ‚Äúperhaps,‚Äù which communicated an obscure and singular sense to the words of the mayor‚Äôs speech. She replied, lowering her eyes and her voice respectfully:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIn that case, she is asleep; but Monsieur le Maire may enter.‚Äù
U||He made some remarks about a door which shut badly, and the noise of which might awaken the sick woman; then he entered Fantine‚Äôs chamber, approached the bed and drew aside the curtains. She was asleep. Her breath issued from her breast with that tragic sound which is peculiar to those maladies, and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they are watching through the night beside their sleeping child who is condemned to death. But this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort of ineffable serenity which overspread her countenance, and which transfigured her in her sleep. Her pallor had become whiteness; her cheeks were crimson; her long golden lashes, the only beauty of her youth and her virginity which remained to her, palpitated, though they remained closed and drooping. Her whole person was trembling with an indescribable unfolding of wings, all ready to open wide and bear her away, which could be felt as they rustled, though they could not be seen. To see her thus, one would never have dreamed that 
U||she was an invalid whose life was almost despaired of. She resembled rather something on the point of soaring away than something on the point of dying.
U||The branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower, and seems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time. The human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives in which the mysterious fingers of Death are about to pluck the soul.
U||M. Madeleine remained for some time motionless beside that bed, gazing in turn upon the sick woman and the crucifix, as he had done two months before, on the day when he had come for the first time to see her in that asylum. They were both still there in the same attitude‚Äîshe sleeping, he praying; only now, after the lapse of two months, her hair was gray and his was white.
U||The sister had not entered with him. He stood beside the bed, with his finger on his lips, as though there were some one in the chamber whom he must enjoin to silence.
U||She opened her eyes, saw him, and said quietly, with a smile:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd Cosette?‚Äù
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîFANTINE HAPPY
U||She made no movement of either surprise or of joy; she was joy itself. That simple question, ‚ÄúAnd Cosette?‚Äù was put with so profound a faith, with so much certainty, with such a complete absence of disquiet and of doubt, that he found not a word of reply. She continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI knew that you were there. I was asleep, but I saw you. I have seen you for a long, long time. I have been following you with my eyes all night long. You were in a glory, and you had around you all sorts of celestial forms.‚Äù
U||He raised his glance to the crucifix.
U||‚ÄúBut,‚Äù she resumed, ‚Äútell me where Cosette is. Why did not you place her on my bed against the moment of my waking?‚Äù
U||He made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able to recall.
U||Fortunately, the doctor had been warned, and he now made his appearance. He came to the aid of M. Madeleine.
U||‚ÄúCalm yourself, my child,‚Äù said the doctor; ‚Äúyour child is here.‚Äù
U||Fantine‚Äôs eyes beamed and filled her whole face with light. She clasped her hands with an expression which contained all that is possible to prayer in the way of violence and tenderness.
U||‚ÄúOh!‚Äù she exclaimed, ‚Äúbring her to me!‚Äù
U||Touching illusion of a mother! Cosette was, for her, still the little child who is carried.
U||‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù said the doctor, ‚Äúnot just now. You still have some fever. The sight of your child would agitate you and do you harm. You must be cured first.‚Äù
U||She interrupted him impetuously:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBut I am cured! Oh, I tell you that I am cured! What an ass that doctor is! The idea! I want to see my child!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou see,‚Äù said the doctor, ‚Äúhow excited you become. So long as you are in this state I shall oppose your having your child. It is not enough to see her; it is necessary that you should live for her. When you are reasonable, I will bring her to you myself.‚Äù
U||The poor mother bowed her head.
U||‚ÄúI beg your pardon, doctor, I really beg your pardon. Formerly I should never have spoken as I have just done; so many misfortunes have happened to me, that I sometimes do not know what I am saying. I understand you; you fear the emotion. I will wait as long as you like, but I swear to you that it would not have harmed me to see my daughter. I have been seeing her; I have not taken my eyes from her since yesterday evening. Do you know? If she were brought to me now, I should talk to her very gently. That is all. Is it not quite natural that I should desire to see my daughter, who has been brought to me expressly from Montfermeil? I am not angry. I know well that I am about to be happy. All night long I have seen white things, and persons who smiled at me. When Monsieur le Docteur pleases, he shall bring me Cosette. I have no longer any fever; I am well. I am perfectly conscious that there is nothing the matter with me any more; but I am going to behave as though I were ill, and not stir, to please these la
U||dies here. When it is seen that I am very calm, they will say, ‚ÄòShe must have her child.‚Äô‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed. She turned towards him; she was making a visible effort to be calm and ‚Äúvery good,‚Äù as she expressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy, in order that, seeing her so peaceable, they might make no difficulty about bringing Cosette to her. But while she controlled herself she could not refrain from questioning M. Madeleine.
U||‚ÄúDid you have a pleasant trip, Monsieur le Maire? Oh! how good you were to go and get her for me! Only tell me how she is. Did she stand the journey well? Alas! she will not recognize me. She must have forgotten me by this time, poor darling! Children have no memories. They are like birds. A child sees one thing to-day and another thing to-morrow, and thinks of nothing any longer. And did she have white linen? Did those Th√©nardiers keep her clean? How have they fed her? Oh! if you only knew how I have suffered, putting such questions as that to myself during all the time of my wretchedness. Now, it is all past. I am happy. Oh, how I should like to see her! Do you think her pretty, Monsieur le Maire? Is not my daughter beautiful? You must have been very cold in that diligence! Could she not be brought for just one little instant? She might be taken away directly afterwards. Tell me; you are the master; it could be so if you chose!‚Äù
U||He took her hand. ‚ÄúCosette is beautiful,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúCosette is well. You shall see her soon; but calm yourself; you are talking with too much vivacity, and you are throwing your arms out from under the clothes, and that makes you cough.‚Äù
U||In fact, fits of coughing interrupted Fantine at nearly every word.
U||Fantine did not murmur; she feared that she had injured by her too passionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous of inspiring, and she began to talk of indifferent things.
U||‚ÄúMontfermeil is quite pretty, is it not? People go there on pleasure parties in summer. Are the Th√©nardiers prosperous? There are not many travellers in their parts. That inn of theirs is a sort of a cook-shop.‚Äù
U||M. Madeleine was still holding her hand, and gazing at her with anxiety; it was evident that he had come to tell her things before which his mind now hesitated. The doctor, having finished his visit, retired. Sister Simplice remained alone with them.
U||But in the midst of this pause Fantine exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI hear her! mon Dieu, I hear her!‚Äù
U||She stretched out her arm to enjoin silence about her, held her breath, and began to listen with rapture.
U||There was a child playing in the yard‚Äîthe child of the portress or of some work-woman. It was one of those accidents which are always occurring, and which seem to form a part of the mysterious stage-setting of mournful scenes. The child‚Äîa little girl‚Äîwas going and coming, running to warm herself, laughing, singing at the top of her voice. Alas! in what are the plays of children not intermingled. It was this little girl whom Fantine heard singing.
U||‚ÄúOh!‚Äù she resumed, ‚Äúit is my Cosette! I recognize her voice.‚Äù
U||The child retreated as it had come; the voice died away. Fantine listened for a while longer, then her face clouded over, and M. Madeleine heard her say, in a low voice: ‚ÄúHow wicked that doctor is not to allow me to see my daughter! That man has an evil countenance, that he has.‚Äù
U||But the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again. She continued to talk to herself, with her head resting on the pillow: ‚ÄúHow happy we are going to be! We shall have a little garden the very first thing; M. Madeleine has promised it to me. My daughter will play in the garden. She must know her letters by this time. I will make her spell. She will run over the grass after butterflies. I will watch her. Then she will take her first communion. Ah! when will she take her first communion?‚Äù
U||She began to reckon on her fingers.
U||‚ÄúOne, two, three, four‚Äîshe is seven years old. In five years she will have a white veil, and openwork stockings; she will look like a little woman. O my good sister, you do not know how foolish I become when I think of my daughter‚Äôs first communion!‚Äù
U||She began to laugh.
U||He had released Fantine‚Äôs hand. He listened to her words as one listens to the sighing of the breeze, with his eyes on the ground, his mind absorbed in reflection which had no bottom. All at once she ceased speaking, and this caused him to raise his head mechanically. Fantine had become terrible.
U||She no longer spoke, she no longer breathed; she had raised herself to a sitting posture, her thin shoulder emerged from her chemise; her face, which had been radiant but a moment before, was ghastly, and she seemed to have fixed her eyes, rendered large with terror, on something alarming at the other extremity of the room.
U||‚ÄúGood God!‚Äù he exclaimed; ‚Äúwhat ails you, Fantine?‚Äù
U||She made no reply; she did not remove her eyes from the object which she seemed to see. She removed one hand from his arm, and with the other made him a sign to look behind him.
U||He turned, and beheld Javert.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîJAVERT SATISFIED
U||This is what had taken place.
U||The half-hour after midnight had just struck when M. Madeleine quitted the Hall of Assizes in Arras. He regained his inn just in time to set out again by the mail-wagon, in which he had engaged his place. A little before six o‚Äôclock in the morning he had arrived at M. sur M., and his first care had been to post a letter to M. Laffitte, then to enter the infirmary and see Fantine.
U||However, he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the Court of Assizes, when the district-attorney, recovering from his first shock, had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of M. sur M., to declare that his convictions had not been in the least modified by that curious incident, which would be explained thereafter, and to demand, in the meantime, the condemnation of that Champmathieu, who was evidently the real Jean Valjean. The district-attorney‚Äôs persistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one, of the public, of the court, and of the jury. The counsel for the defence had some difficulty in refuting this harangue and in establishing that, in consequence of the revelations of M. Madeleine, that is to say, of the real Jean Valjean, the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly altered, and that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocent man. Thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas, not very fresh, unfortunately, upon judicial errors, etc., etc.; 
U||the President, in his summing up, had joined the counsel for the defence, and in a few minutes the jury had thrown Champmathieu out of the case.
U||Nevertheless, the district-attorney was bent on having a Jean Valjean; and as he had no longer Champmathieu, he took Madeleine.
U||Immediately after Champmathieu had been set at liberty, the district-attorney shut himself up with the President. They conferred ‚Äúas to the necessity of seizing the person of M. le Maire of M. sur M.‚Äù This phrase, in which there was a great deal of of, is the district-attorney‚Äôs, written with his own hand, on the minutes of his report to the attorney-general. His first emotion having passed off, the President did not offer many objections. Justice must, after all, take its course. And then, when all was said, although the President was a kindly and a tolerably intelligent man, he was, at the same time, a devoted and almost an ardent royalist, and he had been shocked to hear the Mayor of M. sur M. say the Emperor, and not Bonaparte, when alluding to the landing at Cannes.
U||The order for his arrest was accordingly despatched. The district-attorney forwarded it to M. sur M. by a special messenger, at full speed, and entrusted its execution to Police Inspector Javert.
U||The reader knows that Javert had returned to M. sur M. immediately after having given his deposition.
U||Javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the order of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner.
U||The messenger himself was a very clever member of the police, who, in two words, informed Javert of what had taken place at Arras. The order of arrest, signed by the district-attorney, was couched in these words: ‚ÄúInspector Javert will apprehend the body of the Sieur Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M., who, in this day‚Äôs session of the court, was recognized as the liberated convict, Jean Valjean.‚Äù
U||Any one who did not know Javert, and who had chanced to see him at the moment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary, could have divined nothing of what had taken place, and would have thought his air the most ordinary in the world. He was cool, calm, grave, his gray hair was perfectly smooth upon his temples, and he had just mounted the stairs with his habitual deliberation. Any one who was thoroughly acquainted with him, and who had examined him attentively at the moment, would have shuddered. The buckle of his leather stock was under his left ear instead of at the nape of his neck. This betrayed unwonted agitation.
U||Javert was a complete character, who never had a wrinkle in his duty or in his uniform; methodical with malefactors, rigid with the buttons of his coat.
U||That he should have set the buckle of his stock awry, it was indispensable that there should have taken place in him one of those emotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes.
U||He had come in a simple way, had made a requisition on the neighboring post for a corporal and four soldiers, had left the soldiers in the courtyard, had had Fantine‚Äôs room pointed out to him by the portress, who was utterly unsuspicious, accustomed as she was to seeing armed men inquiring for the mayor.
U||On arriving at Fantine‚Äôs chamber, Javert turned the handle, pushed the door open with the gentleness of a sick-nurse or a police spy, and entered.
U||Properly speaking, he did not enter. He stood erect in the half-open door, his hat on his head and his left hand thrust into his coat, which was buttoned up to the chin. In the bend of his elbow the leaden head of his enormous cane, which was hidden behind him, could be seen.
U||Thus he remained for nearly a minute, without his presence being perceived. All at once Fantine raised her eyes, saw him, and made M. Madeleine turn round.
U||The instant that Madeleine‚Äôs glance encountered Javert‚Äôs glance, Javert, without stirring, without moving from his post, without approaching him, became terrible. No human sentiment can be as terrible as joy.
U||It was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul.
U||The satisfaction of at last getting hold of Jean Valjean caused all that was in his soul to appear in his countenance. The depths having been stirred up, mounted to the surface. The humiliation of having, in some slight degree, lost the scent, and of having indulged, for a few moments, in an error with regard to Champmathieu, was effaced by pride at having so well and accurately divined in the first place, and of having for so long cherished a just instinct. Javert‚Äôs content shone forth in his sovereign attitude. The deformity of triumph overspread that narrow brow. All the demonstrations of horror which a satisfied face can afford were there.
U||Javert was in heaven at that moment. Without putting the thing clearly to himself, but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his presence and of his success, he, Javert, personified justice, light, and truth in their celestial function of crushing out evil. Behind him and around him, at an infinite distance, he had authority, reason, the case judged, the legal conscience, the public prosecution, all the stars; he was protecting order, he was causing the law to yield up its thunders, he was avenging society, he was lending a helping hand to the absolute, he was standing erect in the midst of a glory. There existed in his victory a remnant of defiance and of combat. Erect, haughty, brilliant, he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious archangel. The terrible shadow of the action which he was accomplishing caused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenched fist; happy and indignant, he held his heel upon crime, vice, rebellion, perdition, hell; he was r
U||adiant, he exterminated, he smiled, and there was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous Saint Michael.
U||Javert, though frightful, had nothing ignoble about him.
U||Probity, sincerity, candor, conviction, the sense of duty, are things which may become hideous when wrongly directed; but which, even when hideous, remain grand: their majesty, the majesty peculiar to the human conscience, clings to them in the midst of horror; they are virtues which have one vice,‚Äîerror. The honest, pitiless joy of a fanatic in the full flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubriously venerable radiance. Without himself suspecting the fact, Javert in his formidable happiness was to be pitied, as is every ignorant man who triumphs. Nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as this face, wherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of the good.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîAUTHORITY REASSERTS ITS RIGHTS
U||Fantine had not seen Javert since the day on which the mayor had torn her from the man. Her ailing brain comprehended nothing, but the only thing which she did not doubt was that he had come to get her. She could not endure that terrible face; she felt her life quitting her; she hid her face in both hands, and shrieked in her anguish:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Madeleine, save me!‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean‚Äîwe shall henceforth not speak of him otherwise‚Äîhad risen. He said to Fantine in the gentlest and calmest of voices:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBe at ease; it is not for you that he is come.‚Äù
U||Then he addressed Javert, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI know what you want.‚Äù
U||Javert replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBe quick about it!‚Äù
U||There lay in the inflection of voice which accompanied these words something indescribably fierce and frenzied. Javert did not say, ‚ÄúBe quick about it!‚Äù he said ‚ÄúBequiabouit.‚Äù
U||No orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered: it was no longer a human word: it was a roar.
U||He did not proceed according to his custom, he did not enter into the matter, he exhibited no warrant of arrest. In his eyes, Jean Valjean was a sort of mysterious combatant, who was not to be laid hands upon, a wrestler in the dark whom he had had in his grasp for the last five years, without being able to throw him. This arrest was not a beginning, but an end. He confined himself to saying, ‚ÄúBe quick about it!‚Äù
U||As he spoke thus, he did not advance a single step; he hurled at Jean Valjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling-hook, and with which he was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him.
U||It was this glance which Fantine had felt penetrating to the very marrow of her bones two months previously.
U||At Javert‚Äôs exclamation, Fantine opened her eyes once more. But the mayor was there; what had she to fear?
U||Javert advanced to the middle of the room, and cried:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSee here now! Art thou coming?‚Äù
U||The unhappy woman glanced about her. No one was present excepting the nun and the mayor. To whom could that abject use of ‚Äúthou‚Äù be addressed? To her only. She shuddered.
U||Then she beheld a most unprecedented thing, a thing so unprecedented that nothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackest deliriums of fever.
U||She beheld Javert, the police spy, seize the mayor by the collar; she saw the mayor bow his head. It seemed to her that the world was coming to an end.
U||Javert had, in fact, grasped Jean Valjean by the collar.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur le Maire!‚Äù shrieked Fantine.
U||Javert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed all his gums.
U||‚ÄúThere is no longer any Monsieur le Maire here!‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped the collar of his coat. He said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúJavert‚Äî‚Äù
U||Javert interrupted him: ‚ÄúCall me Mr. Inspector.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMonsieur,‚Äù said Jean Valjean, ‚ÄúI should like to say a word to you in private.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAloud! Say it aloud!‚Äù replied Javert; ‚Äúpeople are in the habit of talking aloud to me.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean went on in a lower tone:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI have a request to make of you‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI tell you to speak loud.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut you alone should hear it‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat difference does that make to me? I shall not listen.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean turned towards him and said very rapidly and in a very low voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGrant me three days‚Äô grace! three days in which to go and fetch the child of this unhappy woman. I will pay whatever is necessary. You shall accompany me if you choose.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are making sport of me!‚Äù cried Javert. ‚ÄúCome now, I did not think you such a fool! You ask me to give you three days in which to run away! You say that it is for the purpose of fetching that creature‚Äôs child! Ah! Ah! That‚Äôs good! That‚Äôs really capital!‚Äù
U||Fantine was seized with a fit of trembling.
U||‚ÄúMy child!‚Äù she cried, ‚Äúto go and fetch my child! She is not here, then! Answer me, sister; where is Cosette? I want my child! Monsieur Madeleine! Monsieur le Maire!‚Äù
U||Javert stamped his foot.
U||‚ÄúAnd now there‚Äôs the other one! Will you hold your tongue, you hussy? It‚Äôs a pretty sort of a place where convicts are magistrates, and where women of the town are cared for like countesses! Ah! But we are going to change all that; it is high time!‚Äù
U||He stared intently at Fantine, and added, once more taking into his grasp Jean Valjean‚Äôs cravat, shirt and collar:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI tell you that there is no Monsieur Madeleine and that there is no Monsieur le Maire. There is a thief, a brigand, a convict named Jean Valjean! And I have him in my grasp! That‚Äôs what there is!‚Äù
U||Fantine raised herself in bed with a bound, supporting herself on her stiffened arms and on both hands: she gazed at Jean Valjean, she gazed at Javert, she gazed at the nun, she opened her mouth as though to speak; a rattle proceeded from the depths of her throat, her teeth chattered; she stretched out her arms in her agony, opening her hands convulsively, and fumbling about her like a drowning person; then suddenly fell back on her pillow.
U||Her head struck the head-board of the bed and fell forwards on her breast, with gaping mouth and staring, sightless eyes.
U||She was dead.
U||Jean Valjean laid his hand upon the detaining hand of Javert, and opened it as he would have opened the hand of a baby; then he said to Javert:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou have murdered that woman.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have an end of this!‚Äù shouted Javert, in a fury; ‚ÄúI am not here to listen to argument. Let us economize all that; the guard is below; march on instantly, or you‚Äôll get the thumb-screws!‚Äù
U||In the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead, which was in a decidedly decrepit state, and which served the sisters as a camp-bed when they were watching with the sick. Jean Valjean stepped up to this bed, in a twinkling wrenched off the head-piece, which was already in a dilapidated condition, an easy matter to muscles like his, grasped the principal rod like a bludgeon, and glanced at Javert. Javert retreated towards the door. Jean Valjean, armed with his bar of iron, walked slowly up to Fantine‚Äôs couch. When he arrived there he turned and said to Javert, in a voice that was barely audible:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI advise you not to disturb me at this moment.‚Äù
U||One thing is certain, and that is, that Javert trembled.
U||It did occur to him to summon the guard, but Jean Valjean might avail himself of that moment to effect his escape; so he remained, grasped his cane by the small end, and leaned against the door-post, without removing his eyes from Jean Valjean.
U||Jean Valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed, and his brow on his hand, and began to contemplate the motionless body of Fantine, which lay extended there. He remained thus, mute, absorbed, evidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life. Upon his face and in his attitude there was nothing but inexpressible pity. After a few moments of this meditation he bent towards Fantine, and spoke to her in a low voice.
U||What did he say to her? What could this man, who was reproved, say to that woman, who was dead? What words were those? No one on earth heard them. Did the dead woman hear them? There are some touching illusions which are, perhaps, sublime realities. The point as to which there exists no doubt is, that Sister Simplice, the sole witness of the incident, often said that at the moment that Jean Valjean whispered in Fantine‚Äôs ear, she distinctly beheld an ineffable smile dawn on those pale lips, and in those dim eyes, filled with the amazement of the tomb.
U||Jean Valjean took Fantine‚Äôs head in both his hands, and arranged it on the pillow as a mother might have done for her child; then he tied the string of her chemise, and smoothed her hair back under her cap. That done, he closed her eyes.
U||Fantine‚Äôs face seemed strangely illuminated at that moment.
U||Death, that signifies entrance into the great light.
U||Fantine‚Äôs hand was hanging over the side of the bed. Jean Valjean knelt down before that hand, lifted it gently, and kissed it.
U||Then he rose, and turned to Javert.
U||‚ÄúNow,‚Äù said he, ‚ÄúI am at your disposal.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîA SUITABLE TOMB
U||Javert deposited Jean Valjean in the city prison.
U||The arrest of M. Madeleine occasioned a sensation, or rather, an extraordinary commotion in M. sur M. We are sorry that we cannot conceal the fact, that at the single word, ‚ÄúHe was a convict,‚Äù nearly every one deserted him. In less than two hours all the good that he had done had been forgotten, and he was nothing but a ‚Äúconvict from the galleys.‚Äù It is just to add that the details of what had taken place at Arras were not yet known. All day long conversations like the following were to be heard in all quarters of the town:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know? He was a liberated convict!‚Äù ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe mayor.‚Äù ‚ÄúBah! M. Madeleine?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù ‚ÄúHis name was not Madeleine at all; he had a frightful name, B√©jean, Bojean, Boujean.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh! Good God!‚Äù ‚ÄúHe has been arrested.‚Äù ‚ÄúArrested!‚Äù ‚ÄúIn prison, in the city prison, while waiting to be transferred.‚Äù ‚ÄúUntil he is transferred!‚Äù ‚ÄúHe is to be transferred!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere is he to be taken?‚Äù ‚ÄúHe will be tried at the Assizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell! I suspected as much. That man was too good, too perfect, too affected. He refused the cross; he bestowed sous on all the little scamps he came across. I always thought there was some evil history back of all that.‚Äù
U||The ‚Äúdrawing-rooms‚Äù particularly abounded in remarks of this nature.
U||One old lady, a subscriber to the Drapeau Blanc, made the following remark, the depth of which it is impossible to fathom:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am not sorry. It will be a lesson to the Bonapartists!‚Äù
U||It was thus that the phantom which had been called M. Madeleine vanished from M. sur M. Only three or four persons in all the town remained faithful to his memory. The old portress who had served him was among the number.
U||On the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her lodge, still in a thorough fright, and absorbed in sad reflections. The factory had been closed all day, the carriage gate was bolted, the street was deserted. There was no one in the house but the two nuns, Sister Perp√©tue and Sister Simplice, who were watching beside the body of Fantine.
U||Towards the hour when M. Madeleine was accustomed to return home, the good portress rose mechanically, took from a drawer the key of M. Madeleine‚Äôs chamber, and the flat candlestick which he used every evening to go up to his quarters; then she hung the key on the nail whence he was accustomed to take it, and set the candlestick on one side, as though she was expecting him. Then she sat down again on her chair, and became absorbed in thought once more. The poor, good old woman had done all this without being conscious of it.
U||It was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself from her reverie, and exclaimed, ‚ÄúHold! My good God Jesus! And I hung his key on the nail!‚Äù
U||At that moment the small window in the lodge opened, a hand passed through, seized the key and the candlestick, and lighted the taper at the candle which was burning there.
U||The portress raised her eyes, and stood there with gaping mouth, and a shriek which she confined to her throat.
U||She knew that hand, that arm, the sleeve of that coat.
U||It was M. Madeleine.
U||It was several seconds before she could speak; she had a seizure, as she said herself, when she related the adventure afterwards.
U||‚ÄúGood God, Monsieur le Maire,‚Äù she cried at last, ‚ÄúI thought you were‚Äî‚Äù
U||She stopped; the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking in respect towards the beginning. Jean Valjean was still Monsieur le Maire to her.
U||He finished her thought.
U||‚ÄúIn prison,‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúI was there; I broke a bar of one of the windows; I let myself drop from the top of a roof, and here I am. I am going up to my room; go and find Sister Simplice for me. She is with that poor woman, no doubt.‚Äù
U||The old woman obeyed in all haste.
U||He gave her no orders; he was quite sure that she would guard him better than he should guard himself.
U||No one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard without opening the big gates. He had, and always carried about him, a pass-key which opened a little side-door; but he must have been searched, and his latch-key must have been taken from him. This point was never explained.
U||He ascended the staircase leading to his chamber. On arriving at the top, he left his candle on the top step of his stairs, opened his door with very little noise, went and closed his window and his shutters by feeling, then returned for his candle and re-entered his room.
U||It was a useful precaution; it will be recollected that his window could be seen from the street.
U||He cast a glance about him, at his table, at his chair, at his bed which had not been disturbed for three days. No trace of the disorder of the night before last remained. The portress had ‚Äúdone up‚Äù his room; only she had picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the two iron ends of the cudgel and the forty-sou piece which had been blackened by the fire.
U||He took a sheet of paper, on which he wrote: ‚ÄúThese are the two tips of my iron-shod cudgel and the forty-sou piece stolen from Little Gervais, which I mentioned at the Court of Assizes,‚Äù and he arranged this piece of paper, the bits of iron, and the coin in such a way that they were the first things to be seen on entering the room. From a cupboard he pulled out one of his old shirts, which he tore in pieces. In the strips of linen thus prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks. He betrayed neither haste nor agitation; and while he was wrapping up the Bishop‚Äôs candlesticks, he nibbled at a piece of black bread. It was probably the prison-bread which he had carried with him in his flight.
U||This was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the room when the authorities made an examination later on.
U||There came two taps at the door.
U||‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù said he.
U||It was Sister Simplice.
U||She was pale; her eyes were red; the candle which she carried trembled in her hand. The peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is, that however polished or cool we may be, they wring human nature from our very bowels, and force it to reappear on the surface. The emotions of that day had turned the nun into a woman once more. She had wept, and she was trembling.
U||Jean Valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper, which he handed to the nun, saying, ‚ÄúSister, you will give this to Monsieur le Cur√©.‚Äù
U||The paper was not folded. She cast a glance upon it.
U||‚ÄúYou can read it,‚Äù said he.
U||She read:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI beg Monsieur le Cur√© to keep an eye on all that I leave behind me. He will be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial, and of the funeral of the woman who died yesterday. The rest is for the poor.‚Äù
U||The sister tried to speak, but she only managed to stammer a few inarticulate sounds. She succeeded in saying, however:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDoes not Monsieur le Maire desire to take a last look at that poor, unhappy woman?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said he; ‚ÄúI am pursued; it would only end in their arresting me in that room, and that would disturb her.‚Äù
U||He had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on the staircase. They heard a tumult of ascending footsteps, and the old portress saying in her loudest and most piercing tones:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMy good sir, I swear to you by the good God, that not a soul has entered this house all day, nor all the evening, and that I have not even left the door.‚Äù
U||A man responded:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBut there is a light in that room, nevertheless.‚Äù
U||They recognized Javert‚Äôs voice.
U||The chamber was so arranged that the door in opening masked the corner of the wall on the right. Jean Valjean blew out the light and placed himself in this angle. Sister Simplice fell on her knees near the table.
U||The door opened.
U||Javert entered.
U||The whispers of many men and the protestations of the portress were audible in the corridor.
U||The nun did not raise her eyes. She was praying.
U||The candle was on the chimney-piece, and gave but very little light.
U||Javert caught sight of the nun and halted in amazement.
U||It will be remembered that the fundamental point in Javert, his element, the very air he breathed, was veneration for all authority. This was impregnable, and admitted of neither objection nor restriction. In his eyes, of course, the ecclesiastical authority was the chief of all; he was religious, superficial and correct on this point as on all others. In his eyes, a priest was a mind, who never makes a mistake; a nun was a creature who never sins; they were souls walled in from this world, with a single door which never opened except to allow the truth to pass through.
U||On perceiving the sister, his first movement was to retire.
U||But there was also another duty which bound him and impelled him imperiously in the opposite direction. His second movement was to remain and to venture on at least one question.
U||This was Sister Simplice, who had never told a lie in her life. Javert knew it, and held her in special veneration in consequence.
U||‚ÄúSister,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúare you alone in this room?‚Äù
U||A terrible moment ensued, during which the poor portress felt as though she should faint.
U||The sister raised her eyes and answered:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThen,‚Äù resumed Javert, ‚Äúyou will excuse me if I persist; it is my duty; you have not seen a certain person‚Äîa man‚Äîthis evening? He has escaped; we are in search of him‚Äîthat Jean Valjean; you have not seen him?‚Äù
U||The sister replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||She lied. She had lied twice in succession, one after the other, without hesitation, promptly, as a person does when sacrificing herself.
U||‚ÄúPardon me,‚Äù said Javert, and he retired with a deep bow.
U||O sainted maid! you left this world many years ago; you have rejoined your sisters, the virgins, and your brothers, the angels, in the light; may this lie be counted to your credit in paradise!
U||The sister‚Äôs affirmation was for Javert so decisive a thing that he did not even observe the singularity of that candle which had but just been extinguished, and which was still smoking on the table.
U||An hour later, a man, marching amid trees and mists, was rapidly departing from M. sur M. in the direction of Paris. That man was Jean Valjean. It has been established by the testimony of two or three carters who met him, that he was carrying a bundle; that he was dressed in a blouse. Where had he obtained that blouse? No one ever found out. But an aged workman had died in the infirmary of the factory a few days before, leaving behind him nothing but his blouse. Perhaps that was the one.
U||One last word about Fantine.
U||We all have a mother,‚Äîthe earth. Fantine was given back to that mother.
U||The cur√© thought that he was doing right, and perhaps he really was, in reserving as much money as possible from what Jean Valjean had left for the poor. Who was concerned, after all? A convict and a woman of the town. That is why he had a very simple funeral for Fantine, and reduced it to that strictly necessary form known as the pauper‚Äôs grave.
U||So Fantine was buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongs to anybody and everybody, and where the poor are lost. Fortunately, God knows where to find the soul again. Fantine was laid in the shade, among the first bones that came to hand; she was subjected to the promiscuousness of ashes. She was thrown into the public grave. Her grave resembled her bed.

U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîWHAT IS MET WITH ON THE WAY FROM NIVELLES
U||Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person who is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles, and directing his course towards La Hulpe. He was on foot. He was pursuing a broad paved road, which undulated between two rows of trees, over the hills which succeed each other, raise the road and let it fall again, and produce something in the nature of enormous waves.
U||He had passed Lillois and Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. In the west he perceived the slate-roofed tower of Braine-l‚ÄôAlleud, which has the form of a reversed vase. He had just left behind a wood upon an eminence; and at the angle of the crossroad, by the side of a sort of mouldy gibbet bearing the inscription Ancient Barrier No. 4, a public house, bearing on its front this sign: At the Four Winds (Aux Quatre Vents). √âchabeau, Private Caf√©.
U||A quarter of a league further on, he arrived at the bottom of a little valley, where there is water which passes beneath an arch made through the embankment of the road. The clump of sparsely planted but very green trees, which fills the valley on one side of the road, is dispersed over the meadows on the other, and disappears gracefully and as in order in the direction of Braine-l‚ÄôAlleud.
U||On the right, close to the road, was an inn, with a four-wheeled cart at the door, a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap of dried brushwood near a flourishing hedge, lime smoking in a square hole, and a ladder suspended along an old penthouse with straw partitions. A young girl was weeding in a field, where a huge yellow poster, probably of some outside spectacle, such as a parish festival, was fluttering in the wind. At one corner of the inn, beside a pool in which a flotilla of ducks was navigating, a badly paved path plunged into the bushes. The wayfarer struck into this.
U||After traversing a hundred paces, skirting a wall of the fifteenth century, surmounted by a pointed gable, with bricks set in contrast, he found himself before a large door of arched stone, with a rectilinear impost, in the sombre style of Louis XIV., flanked by two flat medallions. A severe fa√ßade rose above this door; a wall, perpendicular to the fa√ßade, almost touched the door, and flanked it with an abrupt right angle. In the meadow before the door lay three harrows, through which, in disorder, grew all the flowers of May. The door was closed. The two decrepit leaves which barred it were ornamented with an old rusty knocker.
U||The sun was charming; the branches had that soft shivering of May, which seems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind. A brave little bird, probably a lover, was carolling in a distracted manner in a large tree.
U||The wayfarer bent over and examined a rather large circular excavation, resembling the hollow of a sphere, in the stone on the left, at the foot of the pier of the door.
U||At this moment the leaves of the door parted, and a peasant woman emerged.
U||She saw the wayfarer, and perceived what he was looking at.
U||‚ÄúIt was a French cannon-ball which made that,‚Äù she said to him. And she added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat which you see there, higher up in the door, near a nail, is the hole of a big iron bullet as large as an egg. The bullet did not pierce the wood.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is the name of this place?‚Äù inquired the wayfarer.
U||‚ÄúHougomont,‚Äù said the peasant woman.
U||The traveller straightened himself up. He walked on a few paces, and went off to look over the tops of the hedges. On the horizon through the trees, he perceived a sort of little elevation, and on this elevation something which at that distance resembled a lion.
U||He was on the battle-field of Waterloo.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîHOUGOMONT
U||Hougomont,‚Äîthis was a funereal spot, the beginning of the obstacle, the first resistance, which that great wood-cutter of Europe, called Napoleon, encountered at Waterloo, the first knot under the blows of his axe.
U||It was a ch√¢teau; it is no longer anything but a farm. For the antiquary, Hougomont is Hugomons. This manor was built by Hugo, Sire of Somerel, the same who endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the Abbey of Villiers.
U||The traveller pushed open the door, elbowed an ancient calash under the porch, and entered the courtyard.
U||The first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of the sixteenth century, which here simulates an arcade, everything else having fallen prostrate around it. A monumental aspect often has its birth in ruin. In a wall near the arcade opens another arched door, of the time of Henry IV., permitting a glimpse of the trees of an orchard; beside this door, a manure-hole, some pickaxes, some shovels, some carts, an old well, with its flagstone and its iron reel, a chicken jumping, and a turkey spreading its tail, a chapel surmounted by a small bell-tower, a blossoming pear-tree trained in espalier against the wall of the chapel‚Äîbehold the court, the conquest of which was one of Napoleon‚Äôs dreams. This corner of earth, could he but have seized it, would, perhaps, have given him the world likewise. Chickens are scattering its dust abroad with their beaks. A growl is audible; it is a huge dog, who shows his teeth and replaces the English.
U||The English behaved admirably there. Cooke‚Äôs four companies of guards there held out for seven hours against the fury of an army.
U||Hougomont viewed on the map, as a geometrical plan, comprising buildings and enclosures, presents a sort of irregular rectangle, one angle of which is nicked out. It is this angle which contains the southern door, guarded by this wall, which commands it only a gun‚Äôs length away. Hougomont has two doors,‚Äîthe southern door, that of the ch√¢teau; and the northern door, belonging to the farm. Napoleon sent his brother J√©r√¥me against Hougomont; the divisions of Foy, Guilleminot, and Bachelu hurled themselves against it; nearly the entire corps of Reille was employed against it, and miscarried; Kellermann‚Äôs balls were exhausted on this heroic section of wall. Bauduin‚Äôs brigade was not strong enough to force Hougomont on the north, and the brigade of Soye could not do more than effect the beginning of a breach on the south, but without taking it.
U||The farm buildings border the courtyard on the south. A bit of the north door, broken by the French, hangs suspended to the wall. It consists of four planks nailed to two cross-beams, on which the scars of the attack are visible.
U||The northern door, which was beaten in by the French, and which has had a piece applied to it to replace the panel suspended on the wall, stands half-open at the bottom of the paddock; it is cut squarely in the wall, built of stone below, of brick above which closes in the courtyard on the north. It is a simple door for carts, such as exist in all farms, with the two large leaves made of rustic planks: beyond lie the meadows. The dispute over this entrance was furious. For a long time, all sorts of imprints of bloody hands were visible on the door-posts. It was there that Bauduin was killed.
U||The storm of the combat still lingers in this courtyard; its horror is visible there; the confusion of the fray was petrified there; it lives and it dies there; it was only yesterday. The walls are in the death agony, the stones fall; the breaches cry aloud; the holes are wounds; the drooping, quivering trees seem to be making an effort to flee.
U||This courtyard was more built up in 1815 than it is to-day. Buildings which have since been pulled down then formed redans and angles.
U||The English barricaded themselves there; the French made their way in, but could not stand their ground. Beside the chapel, one wing of the ch√¢teau, the only ruin now remaining of the manor of Hougomont, rises in a crumbling state,‚Äîdisembowelled, one might say. The ch√¢teau served for a dungeon, the chapel for a block-house. There men exterminated each other. The French, fired on from every point,‚Äîfrom behind the walls, from the summits of the garrets, from the depths of the cellars, through all the casements, through all the air-holes, through every crack in the stones,‚Äîfetched fagots and set fire to walls and men; the reply to the grape-shot was a conflagration.
U||In the ruined wing, through windows garnished with bars of iron, the dismantled chambers of the main building of brick are visible; the English guards were in ambush in these rooms; the spiral of the staircase, cracked from the ground floor to the very roof, appears like the inside of a broken shell. The staircase has two stories; the English, besieged on the staircase, and massed on its upper steps, had cut off the lower steps. These consisted of large slabs of blue stone, which form a heap among the nettles. Half a score of steps still cling to the wall; on the first is cut the figure of a trident. These inaccessible steps are solid in their niches. All the rest resembles a jaw which has been denuded of its teeth. There are two old trees there: one is dead; the other is wounded at its base, and is clothed with verdure in April. Since 1815 it has taken to growing through the staircase.
U||A massacre took place in the chapel. The interior, which has recovered its calm, is singular. The mass has not been said there since the carnage. Nevertheless, the altar has been left there‚Äîan altar of unpolished wood, placed against a background of roughhewn stone. Four whitewashed walls, a door opposite the altar, two small arched windows; over the door a large wooden crucifix, below the crucifix a square air-hole stopped up with a bundle of hay; on the ground, in one corner, an old window-frame with the glass all broken to pieces‚Äîsuch is the chapel. Near the altar there is nailed up a wooden statue of Saint Anne, of the fifteenth century; the head of the infant Jesus has been carried off by a large ball. The French, who were masters of the chapel for a moment, and were then dislodged, set fire to it. The flames filled this building; it was a perfect furnace; the door was burned, the floor was burned, the wooden Christ was not burned. The fire preyed upon his feet, of which only the blackened stumps ar
U||e now to be seen; then it stopped,‚Äîa miracle, according to the assertion of the people of the neighborhood. The infant Jesus, decapitated, was less fortunate than the Christ.
U||The walls are covered with inscriptions. Near the feet of Christ this name is to be read: Henquinez. Then these others: Conde de Rio Maior Marques y Marquesa de Almagro (Habana). There are French names with exclamation points,‚Äîa sign of wrath. The wall was freshly whitewashed in 1849. The nations insulted each other there.
U||It was at the door of this chapel that the corpse was picked up which held an axe in its hand; this corpse was Sub-Lieutenant Legros.
U||On emerging from the chapel, a well is visible on the left. There are two in this courtyard. One inquires, Why is there no bucket and pulley to this? It is because water is no longer drawn there. Why is water not drawn there? Because it is full of skeletons.
U||The last person who drew water from the well was named Guillaume van Kylsom. He was a peasant who lived at Hougomont, and was gardener there. On the 18th of June, 1815, his family fled and concealed themselves in the woods.
U||The forest surrounding the Abbey of Villiers sheltered these unfortunate people who had been scattered abroad, for many days and nights. There are at this day certain traces recognizable, such as old boles of burned trees, which mark the site of these poor bivouacs trembling in the depths of the thickets.
U||Guillaume van Kylsom remained at Hougomont, ‚Äúto guard the ch√¢teau,‚Äù and concealed himself in the cellar. The English discovered him there. They tore him from his hiding-place, and the combatants forced this frightened man to serve them, by administering blows with the flats of their swords. They were thirsty; this Guillaume brought them water. It was from this well that he drew it. Many drank there their last draught. This well where drank so many of the dead was destined to die itself.
U||After the engagement, they were in haste to bury the dead bodies. Death has a fashion of harassing victory, and she causes the pest to follow glory. The typhus is a concomitant of triumph. This well was deep, and it was turned into a sepulchre. Three hundred dead bodies were cast into it. With too much haste perhaps. Were they all dead? Legend says they were not. It seems that on the night succeeding the interment, feeble voices were heard calling from the well.
U||This well is isolated in the middle of the courtyard. Three walls, part stone, part brick, and simulating a small, square tower, and folded like the leaves of a screen, surround it on all sides. The fourth side is open. It is there that the water was drawn. The wall at the bottom has a sort of shapeless loophole, possibly the hole made by a shell. This little tower had a platform, of which only the beams remain. The iron supports of the well on the right form a cross. On leaning over, the eye is lost in a deep cylinder of brick which is filled with a heaped-up mass of shadows. The base of the walls all about the well is concealed in a growth of nettles.
U||This well has not in front of it that large blue slab which forms the table for all wells in Belgium. The slab has here been replaced by a cross-beam, against which lean five or six shapeless fragments of knotty and petrified wood which resemble huge bones. There is no longer either pail, chain, or pulley; but there is still the stone basin which served the overflow. The rain-water collects there, and from time to time a bird of the neighboring forests comes thither to drink, and then flies away. One house in this ruin, the farmhouse, is still inhabited. The door of this house opens on the courtyard. Upon this door, beside a pretty Gothic lock-plate, there is an iron handle with trefoils placed slanting. At the moment when the Hanoverian lieutenant, Wilda, grasped this handle in order to take refuge in the farm, a French sapper hewed off his hand with an axe.
U||The family who occupy the house had for their grandfather Guillaume van Kylsom, the old gardener, dead long since. A woman with gray hair said to us: ‚ÄúI was there. I was three years old. My sister, who was older, was terrified and wept. They carried us off to the woods. I went there in my mother‚Äôs arms. We glued our ears to the earth to hear. I imitated the cannon, and went boum! boum!‚Äù
U||A door opening from the courtyard on the left led into the orchard, so we were told. The orchard is terrible.
U||It is in three parts; one might almost say, in three acts. The first part is a garden, the second is an orchard, the third is a wood. These three parts have a common enclosure: on the side of the entrance, the buildings of the ch√¢teau and the farm; on the left, a hedge; on the right, a wall; and at the end, a wall. The wall on the right is of brick, the wall at the bottom is of stone. One enters the garden first. It slopes downwards, is planted with gooseberry bushes, choked with a wild growth of vegetation, and terminated by a monumental terrace of cut stone, with balustrade with a double curve.
U||It was a seignorial garden in the first French style which preceded Le N√¥tre; to-day it is ruins and briars. The pilasters are surmounted by globes which resemble cannon-balls of stone. Forty-three balusters can still be counted on their sockets; the rest lie prostrate in the grass. Almost all bear scratches of bullets. One broken baluster is placed on the pediment like a fractured leg.
U||It was in this garden, further down than the orchard, that six light-infantry men of the 1st, having made their way thither, and being unable to escape, hunted down and caught like bears in their dens, accepted the combat with two Hanoverian companies, one of which was armed with carbines. The Hanoverians lined this balustrade and fired from above. The infantry men, replying from below, six against two hundred, intrepid and with no shelter save the currant-bushes, took a quarter of an hour to die.
U||One mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard, properly speaking. There, within the limits of those few square fathoms, fifteen hundred men fell in less than an hour. The wall seems ready to renew the combat. Thirty-eight loopholes, pierced by the English at irregular heights, are there still. In front of the sixth are placed two English tombs of granite. There are loopholes only in the south wall, as the principal attack came from that quarter. The wall is hidden on the outside by a tall hedge; the French came up, thinking that they had to deal only with a hedge, crossed it, and found the wall both an obstacle and an ambuscade, with the English guards behind it, the thirty-eight loopholes firing at once a shower of grape-shot and balls, and Soye‚Äôs brigade was broken against it. Thus Waterloo began.
U||Nevertheless, the orchard was taken. As they had no ladders, the French scaled it with their nails. They fought hand to hand amid the trees. All this grass has been soaked in blood. A battalion of Nassau, seven hundred strong, was overwhelmed there. The outside of the wall, against which Kellermann‚Äôs two batteries were trained, is gnawed by grape-shot.
U||This orchard is sentient, like others, in the month of May. It has its buttercups and its daisies; the grass is tall there; the cart-horses browse there; cords of hair, on which linen is drying, traverse the spaces between the trees and force the passer-by to bend his head; one walks over this uncultivated land, and one‚Äôs foot dives into mole-holes. In the middle of the grass one observes an uprooted tree-bole which lies there all verdant. Major Blackmann leaned against it to die. Beneath a great tree in the neighborhood fell the German general, Duplat, descended from a French family which fled on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. An aged and falling apple-tree leans far over to one side, its wound dressed with a bandage of straw and of clayey loam. Nearly all the apple-trees are falling with age. There is not one which has not had its bullet or its biscayan.6 The skeletons of dead trees abound in this orchard. Crows fly through their branches, and at the end of it is a wood full of violets.
U||Bauduin killed, Foy wounded, conflagration, massacre, carnage, a rivulet formed of English blood, French blood, German blood mingled in fury, a well crammed with corpses, the regiment of Nassau and the regiment of Brunswick destroyed, Duplat killed, Blackmann killed, the English Guards mutilated, twenty French battalions, besides the forty from Reille‚Äôs corps, decimated, three thousand men in that hovel of Hougomont alone cut down, slashed to pieces, shot, burned, with their throats cut,‚Äîand all this so that a peasant can say to-day to the traveller: Monsieur, give me three francs, and if you like, I will explain to you the affair of Waterloo!
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîTHE EIGHTEENTH OF JUNE, 1815
U||Let us turn back,‚Äîthat is one of the story-teller‚Äôs rights,‚Äîand put ourselves once more in the year 1815, and even a little earlier than the epoch when the action narrated in the first part of this book took place.
U||If it had not rained in the night between the 17th and the 18th of June, 1815, the fate of Europe would have been different. A few drops of water, more or less, decided the downfall of Napoleon. All that Providence required in order to make Waterloo the end of Austerlitz was a little more rain, and a cloud traversing the sky out of season sufficed to make a world crumble.
U||The battle of Waterloo could not be begun until half-past eleven o‚Äôclock, and that gave Bl√ºcher time to come up. Why? Because the ground was wet. The artillery had to wait until it became a little firmer before they could man≈ìuvre.
U||Napoleon was an artillery officer, and felt the effects of this. The foundation of this wonderful captain was the man who, in the report to the Directory on Aboukir, said: Such a one of our balls killed six men. All his plans of battle were arranged for projectiles. The key to his victory was to make the artillery converge on one point. He treated the strategy of the hostile general like a citadel, and made a breach in it. He overwhelmed the weak point with grape-shot; he joined and dissolved battles with cannon. There was something of the sharpshooter in his genius. To beat in squares, to pulverize regiments, to break lines, to crush and disperse masses,‚Äîfor him everything lay in this, to strike, strike, strike incessantly,‚Äîand he intrusted this task to the cannon-ball. A redoubtable method, and one which, united with genius, rendered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for the space of fifteen years.
U||On the 18th of June, 1815, he relied all the more on his artillery, because he had numbers on his side. Wellington had only one hundred and fifty-nine mouths of fire; Napoleon had two hundred and forty.
U||Suppose the soil dry, and the artillery capable of moving, the action would have begun at six o‚Äôclock in the morning. The battle would have been won and ended at two o‚Äôclock, three hours before the change of fortune in favor of the Prussians. What amount of blame attaches to Napoleon for the loss of this battle? Is the shipwreck due to the pilot?
U||Was it the evident physical decline of Napoleon that complicated this epoch by an inward diminution of force? Had the twenty years of war worn out the blade as it had worn the scabbard, the soul as well as the body? Did the veteran make himself disastrously felt in the leader? In a word, was this genius, as many historians of note have thought, suffering from an eclipse? Did he go into a frenzy in order to disguise his weakened powers from himself? Did he begin to waver under the delusion of a breath of adventure? Had he become‚Äîa grave matter in a general‚Äîunconscious of peril? Is there an age, in this class of material great men, who may be called the giants of action, when genius grows short-sighted? Old age has no hold on the geniuses of the ideal; for the Dantes and Michael Angelos to grow old is to grow in greatness; is it to grow less for the Hannibals and the Bonapartes? Had Napoleon lost the direct sense of victory? Had he reached the point where he could no longer recognize the reef, could no lon
U||ger divine the snare, no longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses? Had he lost his power of scenting out catastrophes? He who had in former days known all the roads to triumph, and who, from the summit of his chariot of lightning, pointed them out with a sovereign finger, had he now reached that state of sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legions harnessed to it, to the precipice? Was he seized at the age of forty-six with a supreme madness? Was that titanic charioteer of destiny no longer anything more than an immense dare-devil?
U||We do not think so.
U||His plan of battle was, by the confession of all, a masterpiece. To go straight to the centre of the Allies‚Äô line, to make a breach in the enemy, to cut them in two, to drive the British half back on Hal, and the Prussian half on Tongres, to make two shattered fragments of Wellington and Bl√ºcher, to carry Mont-Saint-Jean, to seize Brussels, to hurl the German into the Rhine, and the Englishman into the sea. All this was contained in that battle, according to Napoleon. Afterwards people would see.
U||Of course, we do not here pretend to furnish a history of the battle of Waterloo; one of the scenes of the foundation of the story which we are relating is connected with this battle, but this history is not our subject; this history, moreover, has been finished, and finished in a masterly manner, from one point of view by Napoleon, and from another point of view by a whole pleiad of historians.7
U||As for us, we leave the historians at loggerheads; we are but a distant witness, a passer-by on the plain, a seeker bending over that soil all made of human flesh, taking appearances for realities, perchance; we have no right to oppose, in the name of science, a collection of facts which contain illusions, no doubt; we possess neither military practice nor strategic ability which authorize a system; in our opinion, a chain of accidents dominated the two leaders at Waterloo; and when it becomes a question of destiny, that mysterious culprit, we judge like that ingenious judge, the populace.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîA
U||Those persons who wish to gain a clear idea of the battle of Waterloo have only to place, mentally, on the ground, a capital A. The left limb of the A is the road to Nivelles, the right limb is the road to Genappe, the tie of the A is the hollow road to Ohain from Braine-l‚ÄôAlleud. The top of the A is Mont-Saint-Jean, where Wellington is; the lower left tip is Hougomont, where Reille is stationed with J√©r√¥me Bonaparte; the right tip is the Belle-Alliance, where Napoleon was. At the centre of this chord is the precise point where the final word of the battle was pronounced. It was there that the lion has been placed, the involuntary symbol of the supreme heroism of the Imperial Guard.
U||The triangle included in the top of the A, between the two limbs and the tie, is the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. The dispute over this plateau constituted the whole battle. The wings of the two armies extended to the right and left of the two roads to Genappe and Nivelles; d‚ÄôErlon facing Picton, Reille facing Hill.
U||Behind the tip of the A, behind the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, is the forest of Soignes.
U||As for the plain itself, let the reader picture to himself a vast undulating sweep of ground; each rise commands the next rise, and all the undulations mount towards Mont-Saint-Jean, and there end in the forest.
U||Two hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers. It is a question of seizing the opponent round the waist. The one seeks to trip up the other. They clutch at everything: a bush is a point of support; an angle of the wall offers them a rest to the shoulder; for the lack of a hovel under whose cover they can draw up, a regiment yields its ground; an unevenness in the ground, a chance turn in the landscape, a cross-path encountered at the right moment, a grove, a ravine, can stay the heel of that colossus which is called an army, and prevent its retreat. He who quits the field is beaten; hence the necessity devolving on the responsible leader, of examining the most insignificant clump of trees, and of studying deeply the slightest relief in the ground.
U||The two generals had attentively studied the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean, now called the plain of Waterloo. In the preceding year, Wellington, with the sagacity of foresight, had examined it as the possible seat of a great battle. Upon this spot, and for this duel, on the 18th of June, Wellington had the good post, Napoleon the bad post. The English army was stationed above, the French army below.
U||It is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of Napoleon on horseback, glass in hand, upon the heights of Rossomme, at daybreak, on June 18, 1815. All the world has seen him before we can show him. That calm profile under the little three-cornered hat of the school of Brienne, that green uniform, the white revers concealing the star of the Legion of Honor, his great coat hiding his epaulets, the corner of red ribbon peeping from beneath his vest, his leather trousers, the white horse with the saddle-cloth of purple velvet bearing on the corners crowned N‚Äôs and eagles, Hessian boots over silk stockings, silver spurs, the sword of Marengo,‚Äîthat whole figure of the last of the C√¶sars is present to all imaginations, saluted with acclamations by some, severely regarded by others.
U||That figure stood for a long time wholly in the light; this arose from a certain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes, and which always veils the truth for a longer or shorter time; but to-day history and daylight have arrived.
U||That light called history is pitiless; it possesses this peculiar and divine quality, that, pure light as it is, and precisely because it is wholly light, it often casts a shadow in places where people had hitherto beheld rays; from the same man it constructs two different phantoms, and the one attacks the other and executes justice on it, and the shadows of the despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader. Hence arises a truer measure in the definitive judgments of nations. Babylon violated lessens Alexander, Rome enchained lessens C√¶sar, Jerusalem murdered lessens Titus, tyranny follows the tyrant. It is a misfortune for a man to leave behind him the night which bears his form.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîTHE QUID OBSCURUM OF BATTLES
U||Every one is acquainted with the first phase of this battle; a beginning which was troubled, uncertain, hesitating, menacing to both armies, but still more so for the English than for the French.
U||It had rained all night, the earth had been cut up by the downpour, the water had accumulated here and there in the hollows of the plain as if in casks; at some points the gear of the artillery carriages was buried up to the axles, the circingles of the horses were dripping with liquid mud. If the wheat and rye trampled down by this cohort of transports on the march had not filled in the ruts and strewn a litter beneath the wheels, all movement, particularly in the valleys, in the direction of Papelotte would have been impossible.
U||The affair began late. Napoleon, as we have already explained, was in the habit of keeping all his artillery well in hand, like a pistol, aiming it now at one point, now at another, of the battle; and it had been his wish to wait until the horse batteries could move and gallop freely. In order to do that it was necessary that the sun should come out and dry the soil. But the sun did not make its appearance. It was no longer the rendezvous of Austerlitz. When the first cannon was fired, the English general, Colville, looked at his watch, and noted that it was thirty-five minutes past eleven.
U||The action was begun furiously, with more fury, perhaps, than the Emperor would have wished, by the left wing of the French resting on Hougomont. At the same time Napoleon attacked the centre by hurling Quiot‚Äôs brigade on La Haie-Sainte, and Ney pushed forward the right wing of the French against the left wing of the English, which rested on Papelotte.
U||The attack on Hougomont was something of a feint; the plan was to draw Wellington thither, and to make him swerve to the left. This plan would have succeeded if the four companies of the English guards and the brave Belgians of Perponcher‚Äôs division had not held the position solidly, and Wellington, instead of massing his troops there, could confine himself to despatching thither, as reinforcements, only four more companies of guards and one battalion from Brunswick.
U||The attack of the right wing of the French on Papelotte was calculated, in fact, to overthrow the English left, to cut off the road to Brussels, to bar the passage against possible Prussians, to force Mont-Saint-Jean, to turn Wellington back on Hougomont, thence on Braine-l‚ÄôAlleud, thence on Hal; nothing easier. With the exception of a few incidents this attack succeeded. Papelotte was taken; La Haie-Sainte was carried.
U||A detail to be noted. There was in the English infantry, particularly in Kempt‚Äôs brigade, a great many raw recruits. These young soldiers were valiant in the presence of our redoubtable infantry; their inexperience extricated them intrepidly from the dilemma; they performed particularly excellent service as skirmishers: the soldier skirmisher, left somewhat to himself, becomes, so to speak, his own general. These recruits displayed some of the French ingenuity and fury. This novice of an infantry had dash. This displeased Wellington.
U||After the taking of La Haie-Sainte the battle wavered.
U||There is in this day an obscure interval, from midday to four o‚Äôclock; the middle portion of this battle is almost indistinct, and participates in the sombreness of the hand-to-hand conflict. Twilight reigns over it. We perceive vast fluctuations in that fog, a dizzy mirage, paraphernalia of war almost unknown to-day, pendant colbacks, floating sabre-taches, cross-belts, cartridge-boxes for grenades, hussar dolmans, red boots with a thousand wrinkles, heavy shakos garlanded with torsades, the almost black infantry of Brunswick mingled with the scarlet infantry of England, the English soldiers with great, white circular pads on the slopes of their shoulders for epaulets, the Hanoverian light-horse with their oblong casques of leather, with brass hands and red horse-tails, the Scotch with their bare knees and plaids, the great white gaiters of our grenadiers; pictures, not strategic lines‚Äîwhat Salvator Rosa requires, not what is suited to the needs of Gribeauval.
U||A certain amount of tempest is always mingled with a battle. Quid obscurum, quid divinum. Each historian traces, to some extent, the particular feature which pleases him amid this pell-mell. Whatever may be the combinations of the generals, the shock of armed masses has an incalculable ebb. During the action the plans of the two leaders enter into each other and become mutually thrown out of shape. Such a point of the field of battle devours more combatants than such another, just as more or less spongy soils soak up more or less quickly the water which is poured on them. It becomes necessary to pour out more soldiers than one would like; a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen. The line of battle waves and undulates like a thread, the trails of blood gush illogically, the fronts of the armies waver, the regiments form capes and gulfs as they enter and withdraw; all these reefs are continually moving in front of each other. Where the infantry stood the artillery arrives, the cavalry rushes in where
U|| the artillery was, the battalions are like smoke. There was something there; seek it. It has disappeared; the open spots change place, the sombre folds advance and retreat, a sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes forward, hurls back, distends, and disperses these tragic multitudes. What is a fray? an oscillation? The immobility of a mathematical plan expresses a minute, not a day. In order to depict a battle, there is required one of those powerful painters who have chaos in their brushes. Rembrandt is better than Vandermeulen; Vandermeulen, exact at noon, lies at three o‚Äôclock. Geometry is deceptive; the hurricane alone is trustworthy. That is what confers on Folard the right to contradict Polybius. Let us add, that there is a certain instant when the battle degenerates into a combat, becomes specialized, and disperses into innumerable detailed feats, which, to borrow the expression of Napoleon himself, ‚Äúbelong rather to the biography of the regiments than to the history of the army.‚Äù The historian 
U||has, in this case, the evident right to sum up the whole. He cannot do more than seize the principal outlines of the struggle, and it is not given to any one narrator, however conscientious he may be, to fix, absolutely, the form of that horrible cloud which is called a battle.
U||This, which is true of all great armed encounters, is particularly applicable to Waterloo.
U||Nevertheless, at a certain moment in the afternoon the battle came to a point.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîFOUR O‚ÄôCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
U||Towards four o‚Äôclock the condition of the English army was serious. The Prince of Orange was in command of the centre, Hill of the right wing, Picton of the left wing. The Prince of Orange, desperate and intrepid, shouted to the Hollando-Belgians: ‚ÄúNassau! Brunswick! Never retreat!‚Äù Hill, having been weakened, had come up to the support of Wellington; Picton was dead. At the very moment when the English had captured from the French the flag of the 105th of the line, the French had killed the English general, Picton, with a bullet through the head. The battle had, for Wellington, two bases of action, Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte; Hougomont still held out, but was on fire; La Haie-Sainte was taken. Of the German battalion which defended it, only forty-two men survived; all the officers, except five, were either dead or captured. Three thousand combatants had been massacred in that barn. A sergeant of the English Guards, the foremost boxer in England, reputed invulnerable by his companions, had been kille
U||d there by a little French drummer-boy. Baring had been dislodged, Alten put to the sword. Many flags had been lost, one from Alten‚Äôs division, and one from the battalion of Lunenburg, carried by a prince of the house of Deux-Ponts. The Scotch Grays no longer existed; Ponsonby‚Äôs great dragoons had been hacked to pieces. That valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of Bro and beneath the cuirassiers of Travers; out of twelve hundred horses, six hundred remained; out of three lieutenant-colonels, two lay on the earth,‚ÄîHamilton wounded, Mater slain. Ponsonby had fallen, riddled by seven lance-thrusts. Gordon was dead. Marsh was dead. Two divisions, the fifth and the sixth, had been annihilated.
U||Hougomont injured, La Haie-Sainte taken, there now existed but one rallying-point, the centre. That point still held firm. Wellington reinforced it. He summoned thither Hill, who was at Merle-Braine; he summoned Chass√©, who was at Braine-l‚ÄôAlleud.
U||The centre of the English army, rather concave, very dense, and very compact, was strongly posted. It occupied the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, having behind it the village, and in front of it the slope, which was tolerably steep then. It rested on that stout stone dwelling which at that time belonged to the domain of Nivelles, and which marks the intersection of the roads‚Äîa pile of the sixteenth century, and so robust that the cannon-balls rebounded from it without injuring it. All about the plateau the English had cut the hedges here and there, made embrasures in the hawthorn-trees, thrust the throat of a cannon between two branches, embattled the shrubs. There artillery was ambushed in the brushwood. This punic labor, incontestably authorized by war, which permits traps, was so well done, that Haxo, who had been despatched by the Emperor at nine o‚Äôclock in the morning to reconnoitre the enemy‚Äôs batteries, had discovered nothing of it, and had returned and reported to Napoleon that there were no obsta
U||cles except the two barricades which barred the road to Nivelles and to Genappe. It was at the season when the grain is tall; on the edge of the plateau a battalion of Kempt‚Äôs brigade, the 95th, armed with carabines, was concealed in the tall wheat.
U||Thus assured and buttressed, the centre of the Anglo-Dutch army was well posted. The peril of this position lay in the forest of Soignes, then adjoining the field of battle, and intersected by the ponds of Groenendael and Boitsfort. An army could not retreat thither without dissolving; the regiments would have broken up immediately there. The artillery would have been lost among the morasses. The retreat, according to many a man versed in the art,‚Äîthough it is disputed by others,‚Äîwould have been a disorganized flight.
U||To this centre, Wellington added one of Chass√©‚Äôs brigades taken from the right wing, and one of Wincke‚Äôs brigades taken from the left wing, plus Clinton‚Äôs division. To his English, to the regiments of Halkett, to the brigades of Mitchell, to the guards of Maitland, he gave as reinforcements and aids, the infantry of Brunswick, Nassau‚Äôs contingent, Kielmansegg‚Äôs Hanoverians, and Ompteda‚Äôs Germans. This placed twenty-six battalions under his hand. The right wing, as Charras says, was thrown back on the centre. An enormous battery was masked by sacks of earth at the spot where there now stands what is called the ‚ÄúMuseum of Waterloo.‚Äù Besides this, Wellington had, behind a rise in the ground, Somerset‚Äôs Dragoon Guards, fourteen hundred horse strong. It was the remaining half of the justly celebrated English cavalry. Ponsonby destroyed, Somerset remained.
U||The battery, which, if completed, would have been almost a redoubt, was ranged behind a very low garden wall, backed up with a coating of bags of sand and a large slope of earth. This work was not finished; there had been no time to make a palisade for it.
U||Wellington, uneasy but impassive, was on horseback, and there remained the whole day in the same attitude, a little in advance of the old mill of Mont-Saint-Jean, which is still in existence, beneath an elm, which an Englishman, an enthusiastic vandal, purchased later on for two hundred francs, cut down, and carried off. Wellington was coldly heroic. The bullets rained about him. His aide-de-camp, Gordon, fell at his side. Lord Hill, pointing to a shell which had burst, said to him: ‚ÄúMy lord, what are your orders in case you are killed?‚Äù ‚ÄúTo do like me,‚Äù replied Wellington. To Clinton he said laconically, ‚ÄúTo hold this spot to the last man.‚Äù The day was evidently turning out ill. Wellington shouted to his old companions of Talavera, of Vittoria, of Salamanca: ‚ÄúBoys, can retreat be thought of? Think of old England!‚Äù
U||Towards four o‚Äôclock, the English line drew back. Suddenly nothing was visible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and the sharpshooters; the rest had disappeared: the regiments, dislodged by the shells and the French bullets, retreated into the bottom, now intersected by the back road of the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean; a retrograde movement took place, the English front hid itself, Wellington drew back. ‚ÄúThe beginning of retreat!‚Äù cried Napoleon.
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîNAPOLEON IN A GOOD HUMOR
U||The Emperor, though ill and discommoded on horseback by a local trouble, had never been in a better humor than on that day. His impenetrability had been smiling ever since the morning. On the 18th of June, that profound soul masked by marble beamed blindly. The man who had been gloomy at Austerlitz was gay at Waterloo. The greatest favorites of destiny make mistakes. Our joys are composed of shadow. The supreme smile is God‚Äôs alone.
U||Ridet C√¶sar, Pompeius flebit, said the legionaries of the Fulminatrix Legion. Pompey was not destined to weep on that occasion, but it is certain that C√¶sar laughed. While exploring on horseback at one o‚Äôclock on the preceding night, in storm and rain, in company with Bertrand, the communes in the neighborhood of Rossomme, satisfied at the sight of the long line of the English camp-fires illuminating the whole horizon from Frischemont to Braine-l‚ÄôAlleud, it had seemed to him that fate, to whom he had assigned a day on the field of Waterloo, was exact to the appointment; he stopped his horse, and remained for some time motionless, gazing at the lightning and listening to the thunder; and this fatalist was heard to cast into the darkness this mysterious saying, ‚ÄúWe are in accord.‚Äù Napoleon was mistaken. They were no longer in accord.
U||He took not a moment for sleep; every instant of that night was marked by a joy for him. He traversed the line of the principal outposts, halting here and there to talk to the sentinels. At half-past two, near the wood of Hougomont, he heard the tread of a column on the march; he thought at the moment that it was a retreat on the part of Wellington. He said: ‚ÄúIt is the rear-guard of the English getting under way for the purpose of decamping. I will take prisoners the six thousand English who have just arrived at Ostend.‚Äù He conversed expansively; he regained the animation which he had shown at his landing on the first of March, when he pointed out to the Grand-Marshal the enthusiastic peasant of the Gulf Juan, and cried, ‚ÄúWell, Bertrand, here is a reinforcement already!‚Äù On the night of the 17th to the 18th of June he rallied Wellington. ‚ÄúThat little Englishman needs a lesson,‚Äù said Napoleon. The rain redoubled in violence; the thunder rolled while the Emperor was speaking.
U||At half-past three o‚Äôclock in the morning, he lost one illusion; officers who had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him that the enemy was not making any movement. Nothing was stirring; not a bivouac-fire had been extinguished; the English army was asleep. The silence on earth was profound; the only noise was in the heavens. At four o‚Äôclock, a peasant was brought in to him by the scouts; this peasant had served as guide to a brigade of English cavalry, probably Vivian‚Äôs brigade, which was on its way to take up a position in the village of Ohain, at the extreme left. At five o‚Äôclock, two Belgian deserters reported to him that they had just quitted their regiment, and that the English army was ready for battle. ‚ÄúSo much the better!‚Äù exclaimed Napoleon. ‚ÄúI prefer to overthrow them rather than to drive them back.‚Äù
U||In the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope which forms an angle with the Plancenoit road, had a kitchen table and a peasant‚Äôs chair brought to him from the farm of Rossomme, seated himself, with a truss of straw for a carpet, and spread out on the table the chart of the battle-field, saying to Soult as he did so, ‚ÄúA pretty checker-board.‚Äù
U||In consequence of the rains during the night, the transports of provisions, embedded in the soft roads, had not been able to arrive by morning; the soldiers had had no sleep; they were wet and fasting. This did not prevent Napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully to Ney, ‚ÄúWe have ninety chances out of a hundred.‚Äù At eight o‚Äôclock the Emperor‚Äôs breakfast was brought to him. He invited many generals to it. During breakfast, it was said that Wellington had been to a ball two nights before, in Brussels, at the Duchess of Richmond‚Äôs; and Soult, a rough man of war, with a face of an archbishop, said, ‚ÄúThe ball takes place to-day.‚Äù The Emperor jested with Ney, who said, ‚ÄúWellington will not be so simple as to wait for Your Majesty.‚Äù That was his way, however. ‚ÄúHe was fond of jesting,‚Äù says Fleury de Chaboulon. ‚ÄúA merry humor was at the foundation of his character,‚Äù says Gourgaud. ‚ÄúHe abounded in pleasantries, which were more peculiar than witty,‚Äù says Benjamin Constant. These gayeties of a 
U||giant are worthy of insistence. It was he who called his grenadiers ‚Äúhis grumblers‚Äù; he pinched their ears; he pulled their moustaches. ‚ÄúThe Emperor did nothing but play pranks on us,‚Äù is the remark of one of them. During the mysterious trip from the island of Elba to France, on the 27th of February, on the open sea, the French brig of war, Le Z√©phyr, having encountered the brig L‚ÄôInconstant, on which Napoleon was concealed, and having asked the news of Napoleon from L‚ÄôInconstant, the Emperor, who still wore in his hat the white and amaranthine cockade sown with bees, which he had adopted at the isle of Elba, laughingly seized the speaking-trumpet, and answered for himself, ‚ÄúThe Emperor is well.‚Äù A man who laughs like that is on familiar terms with events. Napoleon indulged in many fits of this laughter during the breakfast at Waterloo. After breakfast he meditated for a quarter of an hour; then two generals seated themselves on the truss of straw, pen in hand and their paper on their knees,
U|| and the Emperor dictated to them the order of battle.
U||At nine o‚Äôclock, at the instant when the French army, ranged in echelons and set in motion in five columns, had deployed‚Äîthe divisions in two lines, the artillery between the brigades, the music at their head; as they beat the march, with rolls on the drums and the blasts of trumpets, mighty, vast, joyous, a sea of casques, of sabres, and of bayonets on the horizon, the Emperor was touched, and twice exclaimed, ‚ÄúMagnificent! Magnificent!‚Äù
U||Between nine o‚Äôclock and half-past ten the whole army, incredible as it may appear, had taken up its position and ranged itself in six lines, forming, to repeat the Emperor‚Äôs expression, ‚Äúthe figure of six V‚Äôs.‚Äù A few moments after the formation of the battle-array, in the midst of that profound silence, like that which heralds the beginning of a storm, which precedes engagements, the Emperor tapped Haxo on the shoulder, as he beheld the three batteries of twelve-pounders, detached by his orders from the corps of Erlon, Reille, and Lobau, and destined to begin the action by taking Mont-Saint-Jean, which was situated at the intersection of the Nivelles and the Genappe roads, and said to him, ‚ÄúThere are four and twenty handsome maids, General.‚Äù
U||Sure of the issue, he encouraged with a smile, as they passed before him, the company of sappers of the first corps, which he had appointed to barricade Mont-Saint-Jean as soon as the village should be carried. All this serenity had been traversed by but a single word of haughty pity; perceiving on his left, at a spot where there now stands a large tomb, those admirable Scotch Grays, with their superb horses, massing themselves, he said, ‚ÄúIt is a pity.‚Äù
U||Then he mounted his horse, advanced beyond Rossomme, and selected for his post of observation a contracted elevation of turf to the right of the road from Genappe to Brussels, which was his second station during the battle. The third station, the one adopted at seven o‚Äôclock in the evening, between La Belle-Alliance and La Haie-Sainte, is formidable; it is a rather elevated knoll, which still exists, and behind which the guard was massed on a slope of the plain. Around this knoll the balls rebounded from the pavements of the road, up to Napoleon himself. As at Brienne, he had over his head the shriek of the bullets and of the heavy artillery. Mouldy cannon-balls, old sword-blades, and shapeless projectiles, eaten up with rust, were picked up at the spot where his horse‚Äôs feet stood. Scabra rubigine. A few years ago, a shell of sixty pounds, still charged, and with its fuse broken off level with the bomb, was unearthed. It was at this last post that the Emperor said to his guide, Lacoste, a hostile and te
U||rrified peasant, who was attached to the saddle of a hussar, and who turned round at every discharge of canister and tried to hide behind Napoleon: ‚ÄúFool, it is shameful! You‚Äôll get yourself killed with a ball in the back.‚Äù He who writes these lines has himself found, in the friable soil of this knoll, on turning over the sand, the remains of the neck of a bomb, disintegrated, by the oxidization of six and forty years, and old fragments of iron which parted like elder-twigs between the fingers.
U||Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the plains, where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took place, are no longer what they were on June 18, 1815. By taking from this mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it, its real relief has been taken away, and history, disconcerted, no longer finds her bearings there. It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying it. Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later, exclaimed, ‚ÄúThey have altered my field of battle!‚Äù Where the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe. The elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from Genappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other, the German tomb, is on the right. There is no F
U||rench tomb. The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France. Thanks to the thousands upon thousands of cartloads of earth employed in the hillock one hundred and fifty feet in height and half a mile in circumference, the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean is now accessible by an easy slope. On the day of battle, particularly on the side of La Haie-Sainte, it was abrupt and difficult of approach. The slope there is so steep that the English cannon could not see the farm, situated in the bottom of the valley, which was the centre of the combat. On the 18th of June, 1815, the rains had still farther increased this acclivity, the mud complicated the problem of the ascent, and the men not only slipped back, but stuck fast in the mire. Along the crest of the plateau ran a sort of trench whose presence it was impossible for the distant observer to divine.
U||What was this trench? Let us explain. Braine-l‚ÄôAlleud is a Belgian village; Ohain is another. These villages, both of them concealed in curves of the landscape, are connected by a road about a league and a half in length, which traverses the plain along its undulating level, and often enters and buries itself in the hills like a furrow, which makes a ravine of this road in some places. In 1815, as at the present day, this road cut the crest of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean between the two highways from Genappe and Nivelles; only, it is now on a level with the plain; it was then a hollow way. Its two slopes have been appropriated for the monumental hillock. This road was, and still is, a trench throughout the greater portion of its course; a hollow trench, sometimes a dozen feet in depth, and whose banks, being too steep, crumbled away here and there, particularly in winter, under driving rains. Accidents happened here. The road was so narrow at the Braine-l‚ÄôAlleud entrance that a passer-by was crushed b
U||y a cart, as is proved by a stone cross which stands near the cemetery, and which gives the name of the dead, Monsieur Bernard Debrye, Merchant of Brussels, and the date of the accident, February, 1637.8 It was so deep on the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean that a peasant, Mathieu Nicaise, was crushed there, in 1783, by a slide from the slope, as is stated on another stone cross, the top of which has disappeared in the process of clearing the ground, but whose overturned pedestal is still visible on the grassy slope to the left of the highway between La Haie-Sainte and the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean.
U||On the day of battle, this hollow road whose existence was in no way indicated, bordering the crest of Mont-Saint-Jean, a trench at the summit of the escarpment, a rut concealed in the soil, was invisible; that is to say, terrible.
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîTHE EMPEROR PUTS A QUESTION TO THE GUIDE LACOSTE
U||So, on the morning of Waterloo, Napoleon was content.
U||He was right; the plan of battle conceived by him was, as we have seen, really admirable.
U||The battle once begun, its very various changes,‚Äîthe resistance of Hougomont; the tenacity of La Haie-Sainte; the killing of Bauduin; the disabling of Foy; the unexpected wall against which Soye‚Äôs brigade was shattered; Guilleminot‚Äôs fatal heedlessness when he had neither petard nor powder sacks; the miring of the batteries; the fifteen unescorted pieces overwhelmed in a hollow way by Uxbridge; the small effect of the bombs falling in the English lines, and there embedding themselves in the rain-soaked soil, and only succeeding in producing volcanoes of mud, so that the canister was turned into a splash; the uselessness of Pir√©‚Äôs demonstration on Braine-l‚ÄôAlleud; all that cavalry, fifteen squadrons, almost exterminated; the right wing of the English badly alarmed, the left wing badly cut into; Ney‚Äôs strange mistake in massing, instead of echelonning the four divisions of the first corps; men delivered over to grape-shot, arranged in ranks twenty-seven deep and with a frontage of two hundred; the
U|| frightful holes made in these masses by the cannon-balls; attacking columns disorganized; the side-battery suddenly unmasked on their flank; Bourgeois, Donzelot, and Durutte compromised; Quiot repulsed; Lieutenant Vieux, that Hercules graduated at the Polytechnic School, wounded at the moment when he was beating in with an axe the door of La Haie-Sainte under the downright fire of the English barricade which barred the angle of the road from Genappe to Brussels; Marcognet‚Äôs division caught between the infantry and the cavalry, shot down at the very muzzle of the guns amid the grain by Best and Pack, put to the sword by Ponsonby; his battery of seven pieces spiked; the Prince of Saxe-Weimar holding and guarding, in spite of the Comte d‚ÄôErlon, both Frischemont and Smohain; the flag of the 105th taken, the flag of the 45th captured; that black Prussian hussar stopped by runners of the flying column of three hundred light cavalry on the scout between Wavre and Plancenoit; the alarming things that had been s
U||aid by prisoners; Grouchy‚Äôs delay; fifteen hundred men killed in the orchard of Hougomont in less than an hour; eighteen hundred men overthrown in a still shorter time about La Haie-Sainte,‚Äîall these stormy incidents passing like the clouds of battle before Napoleon, had hardly troubled his gaze and had not overshadowed that face of imperial certainty. Napoleon was accustomed to gaze steadily at war; he never added up the heart-rending details, cipher by cipher; ciphers mattered little to him, provided that they furnished the total‚Äîvictory; he was not alarmed if the beginnings did go astray, since he thought himself the master and the possessor at the end; he knew how to wait, supposing himself to be out of the question, and he treated destiny as his equal: he seemed to say to fate, Thou wilt not dare.
U||Composed half of light and half of shadow, Napoleon thought himself protected in good and tolerated in evil. He had, or thought that he had, a connivance, one might almost say a complicity, of events in his favor, which was equivalent to the invulnerability of antiquity.
U||Nevertheless, when one has B√©r√©sina, Leipzig, and Fontainebleau behind one, it seems as though one might distrust Waterloo. A mysterious frown becomes perceptible in the depths of the heavens.
U||At the moment when Wellington retreated, Napoleon shuddered. He suddenly beheld the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean cleared, and the van of the English army disappear. It was rallying, but hiding itself. The Emperor half rose in his stirrups. The lightning of victory flashed from his eyes.
U||Wellington, driven into a corner at the forest of Soignes and destroyed‚Äîthat was the definitive conquest of England by France; it was Cr√©cy, Poitiers, Malplaquet, and Ramillies avenged. The man of Marengo was wiping out Agincourt.
U||So the Emperor, meditating on this terrible turn of fortune, swept his glass for the last time over all the points of the field of battle. His guard, standing behind him with grounded arms, watched him from below with a sort of religion. He pondered; he examined the slopes, noted the declivities, scrutinized the clumps of trees, the square of rye, the path; he seemed to be counting each bush. He gazed with some intentness at the English barricades of the two highways,‚Äîtwo large abatis of trees, that on the road to Genappe above La Haie-Sainte, armed with two cannon, the only ones out of all the English artillery which commanded the extremity of the field of battle, and that on the road to Nivelles where gleamed the Dutch bayonets of Chass√©‚Äôs brigade. Near this barricade he observed the old chapel of Saint Nicholas, painted white, which stands at the angle of the crossroad near Braine-l‚ÄôAlleud; he bent down and spoke in a low voice to the guide Lacoste. The guide made a negative sign with his head, whi
U||ch was probably perfidious.
U||The Emperor straightened himself up and fell to thinking.
U||Wellington had drawn back.
U||All that remained to do was to complete this retreat by crushing him.
U||Napoleon turning round abruptly, despatched an express at full speed to Paris to announce that the battle was won.
U||Napoleon was one of those geniuses from whom thunder darts.
U||He had just found his clap of thunder.
U||He gave orders to Milhaud‚Äôs cuirassiers to carry the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean.
U||CHAPTER IX‚ÄîTHE UNEXPECTED
U||There were three thousand five hundred of them. They formed a front a quarter of a league in extent. They were giant men, on colossal horses. There were six and twenty squadrons of them; and they had behind them to support them Lefebvre-Desnouettes‚Äôs division,‚Äîthe one hundred and six picked gendarmes, the light cavalry of the Guard, eleven hundred and ninety-seven men, and the lancers of the guard of eight hundred and eighty lances. They wore casques without horse-tails, and cuirasses of beaten iron, with horse-pistols in their holsters, and long sabre-swords. That morning the whole army had admired them, when, at nine o‚Äôclock, with braying of trumpets and all the music playing ‚ÄúLet us watch o‚Äôer the Safety of the Empire,‚Äù they had come in a solid column, with one of their batteries on their flank, another in their centre, and deployed in two ranks between the roads to Genappe and Frischemont, and taken up their position for battle in that powerful second line, so cleverly arranged by Napoleon, w
U||hich, having on its extreme left Kellermann‚Äôs cuirassiers and on its extreme right Milhaud‚Äôs cuirassiers, had, so to speak, two wings of iron.
U||Aide-de-camp Bernard carried them the Emperor‚Äôs orders. Ney drew his sword and placed himself at their head. The enormous squadrons were set in motion.
U||Then a formidable spectacle was seen.
U||All their cavalry, with upraised swords, standards and trumpets flung to the breeze, formed in columns by divisions, descended, by a simultaneous movement and like one man, with the precision of a brazen battering-ram which is effecting a breach, the hill of La Belle Alliance, plunged into the terrible depths in which so many men had already fallen, disappeared there in the smoke, then emerging from that shadow, reappeared on the other side of the valley, still compact and in close ranks, mounting at a full trot, through a storm of grape-shot which burst upon them, the terrible muddy slope of the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean. They ascended, grave, threatening, imperturbable; in the intervals between the musketry and the artillery, their colossal trampling was audible. Being two divisions, there were two columns of them; Wathier‚Äôs division held the right, Delort‚Äôs division was on the left. It seemed as though two immense adders of steel were to be seen crawling towards the crest of the table-land. It tra
U||versed the battle like a prodigy.
U||Nothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great redoubt of the Muskowa by the heavy cavalry; Murat was lacking here, but Ney was again present. It seemed as though that mass had become a monster and had but one soul. Each column undulated and swelled like the ring of a polyp. They could be seen through a vast cloud of smoke which was rent here and there. A confusion of helmets, of cries, of sabres, a stormy heaving of the cruppers of horses amid the cannons and the flourish of trumpets, a terrible and disciplined tumult; over all, the cuirasses like the scales on the hydra.
U||These narrations seemed to belong to another age. Something parallel to this vision appeared, no doubt, in the ancient Orphic epics, which told of the centaurs, the old hippanthropes, those Titans with human heads and equestrian chests who scaled Olympus at a gallop, horrible, invulnerable, sublime‚Äîgods and beasts.
U||Odd numerical coincidence,‚Äîtwenty-six battalions rode to meet twenty-six battalions. Behind the crest of the plateau, in the shadow of the masked battery, the English infantry, formed into thirteen squares, two battalions to the square, in two lines, with seven in the first line, six in the second, the stocks of their guns to their shoulders, taking aim at that which was on the point of appearing, waited, calm, mute, motionless. They did not see the cuirassiers, and the cuirassiers did not see them. They listened to the rise of this flood of men. They heard the swelling noise of three thousand horse, the alternate and symmetrical tramp of their hoofs at full trot, the jingling of the cuirasses, the clang of the sabres and a sort of grand and savage breathing. There ensued a most terrible silence; then, all at once, a long file of uplifted arms, brandishing sabres, appeared above the crest, and casques, trumpets, and standards, and three thousand heads with gray moustaches, shouting, ‚ÄúVive l‚ÄôEmpereur!‚Ä
U||ù All this cavalry debouched on the plateau, and it was like the appearance of an earthquake.
U||All at once, a tragic incident; on the English left, on our right, the head of the column of cuirassiers reared up with a frightful clamor. On arriving at the culminating point of the crest, ungovernable, utterly given over to fury and their course of extermination of the squares and cannon, the cuirassiers had just caught sight of a trench,‚Äîa trench between them and the English. It was the hollow road of Ohain.
U||It was a terrible moment. The ravine was there, unexpected, yawning, directly under the horses‚Äô feet, two fathoms deep between its double slopes; the second file pushed the first into it, and the third pushed on the second; the horses reared and fell backward, landed on their haunches, slid down, all four feet in the air, crushing and overwhelming the riders; and there being no means of retreat,‚Äîthe whole column being no longer anything more than a projectile,‚Äîthe force which had been acquired to crush the English crushed the French; the inexorable ravine could only yield when filled; horses and riders rolled there pell-mell, grinding each other, forming but one mass of flesh in this gulf: when this trench was full of living men, the rest marched over them and passed on. Almost a third of Dubois‚Äôs brigade fell into that abyss.
U||This began the loss of the battle.
U||A local tradition, which evidently exaggerates matters, says that two thousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow road of Ohain. This figure probably comprises all the other corpses which were flung into this ravine the day after the combat.
U||Let us note in passing that it was Dubois‚Äôs sorely tried brigade which, an hour previously, making a charge to one side, had captured the flag of the Lunenburg battalion.
U||Napoleon, before giving the order for this charge of Milhaud‚Äôs cuirassiers, had scrutinized the ground, but had not been able to see that hollow road, which did not even form a wrinkle on the surface of the plateau. Warned, nevertheless, and put on the alert by the little white chapel which marks its angle of junction with the Nivelles highway, he had probably put a question as to the possibility of an obstacle, to the guide Lacoste. The guide had answered No. We might almost affirm that Napoleon‚Äôs catastrophe originated in that sign of a peasant‚Äôs head.
U||Other fatalities were destined to arise.
U||Was it possible that Napoleon should have won that battle? We answer No. Why? Because of Wellington? Because of Bl√ºcher? No. Because of God.
U||Bonaparte victor at Waterloo; that does not come within the law of the nineteenth century. Another series of facts was in preparation, in which there was no longer any room for Napoleon. The ill will of events had declared itself long before.
U||It was time that this vast man should fall.
U||The excessive weight of this man in human destiny disturbed the balance. This individual alone counted for more than a universal group. These plethoras of all human vitality concentrated in a single head; the world mounting to the brain of one man,‚Äîthis would be mortal to civilization were it to last. The moment had arrived for the incorruptible and supreme equity to alter its plan. Probably the principles and the elements, on which the regular gravitations of the moral, as of the material, world depend, had complained. Smoking blood, over-filled cemeteries, mothers in tears,‚Äîthese are formidable pleaders. When the earth is suffering from too heavy a burden, there are mysterious groanings of the shades, to which the abyss lends an ear.
U||Napoleon had been denounced in the infinite and his fall had been decided on.
U||He embarrassed God.
U||Waterloo is not a battle; it is a change of front on the part of the Universe.
U||CHAPTER X‚ÄîTHE PLATEAU OF MONT-SAINT-JEAN
U||The battery was unmasked at the same moment with the ravine.
U||Sixty cannons and the thirteen squares darted lightning point-blank on the cuirassiers. The intrepid General Delort made the military salute to the English battery.
U||The whole of the flying artillery of the English had re-entered the squares at a gallop. The cuirassiers had not had even the time for a halt. The disaster of the hollow road had decimated, but not discouraged them. They belonged to that class of men who, when diminished in number, increase in courage.
U||Wathier‚Äôs column alone had suffered in the disaster; Delort‚Äôs column, which Ney had deflected to the left, as though he had a presentiment of an ambush, had arrived whole.
U||The cuirassiers hurled themselves on the English squares.
U||At full speed, with bridles loose, swords in their teeth, pistols in fist,‚Äîsuch was the attack.
U||There are moments in battles in which the soul hardens the man until the soldier is changed into a statue, and when all this flesh turns into granite. The English battalions, desperately assaulted, did not stir.
U||Then it was terrible.
U||All the faces of the English squares were attacked at once. A frenzied whirl enveloped them. That cold infantry remained impassive. The first rank knelt and received the cuirassiers on their bayonets, the second ranks shot them down; behind the second rank the cannoneers charged their guns, the front of the square parted, permitted the passage of an eruption of grape-shot, and closed again. The cuirassiers replied by crushing them. Their great horses reared, strode across the ranks, leaped over the bayonets and fell, gigantic, in the midst of these four living wells. The cannon-balls ploughed furrows in these cuirassiers; the cuirassiers made breaches in the squares. Files of men disappeared, ground to dust under the horses. The bayonets plunged into the bellies of these centaurs; hence a hideousness of wounds which has probably never been seen anywhere else. The squares, wasted by this mad cavalry, closed up their ranks without flinching. Inexhaustible in the matter of grape-shot, they created explosions in
U|| their assailants‚Äô midst. The form of this combat was monstrous. These squares were no longer battalions, they were craters; those cuirassiers were no longer cavalry, they were a tempest. Each square was a volcano attacked by a cloud; lava contended with lightning.
U||The square on the extreme right, the most exposed of all, being in the air, was almost annihilated at the very first shock. lt was formed of the 75th regiment of Highlanders. The bagpipe-player in the centre dropped his melancholy eyes, filled with the reflections of the forests and the lakes, in profound inattention, while men were being exterminated around him, and seated on a drum, with his pibroch under his arm, played the Highland airs. These Scotchmen died thinking of Ben Lothian, as did the Greeks recalling Argos. The sword of a cuirassier, which hewed down the bagpipes and the arm which bore it, put an end to the song by killing the singer.
U||The cuirassiers, relatively few in number, and still further diminished by the catastrophe of the ravine, had almost the whole English army against them, but they multiplied themselves so that each man of them was equal to ten. Nevertheless, some Hanoverian battalions yielded. Wellington perceived it, and thought of his cavalry. Had Napoleon at that same moment thought of his infantry, he would have won the battle. This forgetfulness was his great and fatal mistake.
U||All at once, the cuirassiers, who had been the assailants, found themselves assailed. The English cavalry was at their back. Before them two squares, behind them Somerset; Somerset meant fourteen hundred dragoons of the guard. On the right, Somerset had Dornberg with the German light-horse, and on his left, Trip with the Belgian carabineers; the cuirassiers attacked on the flank and in front, before and in the rear, by infantry and cavalry, had to face all sides. What mattered it to them? They were a whirlwind. Their valor was something indescribable.
U||In addition to this, they had behind them the battery, which was still thundering. It was necessary that it should be so, or they could never have been wounded in the back. One of their cuirasses, pierced on the shoulder by a ball from a biscayan,9 is in the collection of the Waterloo Museum.
U||For such Frenchmen nothing less than such Englishmen was needed. It was no longer a hand-to-hand conflict; it was a shadow, a fury, a dizzy transport of souls and courage, a hurricane of lightning swords. In an instant the fourteen hundred dragoon guards numbered only eight hundred. Fuller, their lieutenant-colonel, fell dead. Ney rushed up with the lancers and Lefebvre-Desnouettes‚Äôs light-horse. The plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean was captured, recaptured, captured again. The cuirassiers quitted the cavalry to return to the infantry; or, to put it more exactly, the whole of that formidable rout collared each other without releasing the other. The squares still held firm.
U||There were a dozen assaults. Ney had four horses killed under him. Half the cuirassiers remained on the plateau. This conflict lasted two hours.
U||The English army was profoundly shaken. There is no doubt that, had they not been enfeebled in their first shock by the disaster of the hollow road the cuirassiers would have overwhelmed the centre and decided the victory. This extraordinary cavalry petrified Clinton, who had seen Talavera and Badajoz. Wellington, three-quarters vanquished, admired heroically. He said in an undertone, ‚ÄúSublime!‚Äù
U||The cuirassiers annihilated seven squares out of thirteen, took or spiked sixty pieces of ordnance, and captured from the English regiments six flags, which three cuirassiers and three chasseurs of the Guard bore to the Emperor, in front of the farm of La Belle Alliance.
U||Wellington‚Äôs situation had grown worse. This strange battle was like a duel between two raging, wounded men, each of whom, still fighting and still resisting, is expending all his blood.
U||Which of the two will be the first to fall?
U||The conflict on the plateau continued.
U||What had become of the cuirassiers? No one could have told. One thing is certain, that on the day after the battle, a cuirassier and his horse were found dead among the woodwork of the scales for vehicles at Mont-Saint-Jean, at the very point where the four roads from Nivelles, Genappe, La Hulpe, and Brussels meet and intersect each other. This horseman had pierced the English lines. One of the men who picked up the body still lives at Mont-Saint-Jean. His name is Dehaze. He was eighteen years old at that time.
U||Wellington felt that he was yielding. The crisis was at hand.
U||The cuirassiers had not succeeded, since the centre was not broken through. As every one was in possession of the plateau, no one held it, and in fact it remained, to a great extent, with the English. Wellington held the village and the culminating plain; Ney had only the crest and the slope. They seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both sides.
U||But the weakening of the English seemed irremediable. The bleeding of that army was horrible. Kempt, on the left wing, demanded reinforcements. ‚ÄúThere are none,‚Äù replied Wellington; ‚Äúhe must let himself be killed!‚Äù Almost at that same moment, a singular coincidence which paints the exhaustion of the two armies, Ney demanded infantry from Napoleon, and Napoleon exclaimed, ‚ÄúInfantry! Where does he expect me to get it? Does he think I can make it?‚Äù
U||Nevertheless, the English army was in the worse case of the two. The furious onsets of those great squadrons with cuirasses of iron and breasts of steel had ground the infantry to nothing. A few men clustered round a flag marked the post of a regiment; such and such a battalion was commanded only by a captain or a lieutenant; Alten‚Äôs division, already so roughly handled at La Haie-Sainte, was almost destroyed; the intrepid Belgians of Van Kluze‚Äôs brigade strewed the rye-fields all along the Nivelles road; hardly anything was left of those Dutch grenadiers, who, intermingled with Spaniards in our ranks in 1811, fought against Wellington; and who, in 1815, rallied to the English standard, fought against Napoleon. The loss in officers was considerable. Lord Uxbridge, who had his leg buried on the following day, had his knee shattered. If, on the French side, in that tussle of the cuirassiers, Delort, l‚ÄôH√©ritier, Colbert, Dnop, Travers, and Blancard were disabled, on the side of the English there was Alte
U||n wounded, Barne wounded, Delancey killed, Van Meeren killed, Ompteda killed, the whole of Wellington‚Äôs staff decimated, and England had the worse of it in that bloody scale. The second regiment of foot-guards had lost five lieutenant-colonels, four captains, and three ensigns; the first battalion of the 30th infantry had lost 24 officers and 1,200 soldiers; the 79th Highlanders had lost 24 officers wounded, 18 officers killed, 450 soldiers killed. The Hanoverian hussars of Cumberland, a whole regiment, with Colonel Hacke at its head, who was destined to be tried later on and cashiered, had turned bridle in the presence of the fray, and had fled to the forest of Soignes, sowing defeat all the way to Brussels. The transports, ammunition-wagons, the baggage-wagons, the wagons filled with wounded, on perceiving that the French were gaining ground and approaching the forest, rushed headlong thither. The Dutch, mowed down by the French cavalry, cried, ‚ÄúAlarm!‚Äù From Vert-Coucou to Groenendael, for a distance
U|| of nearly two leagues in the direction of Brussels, according to the testimony of eye-witnesses who are still alive, the roads were encumbered with fugitives. This panic was such that it attacked the Prince de Cond√© at Mechlin, and Louis XVIII. at Ghent. With the exception of the feeble reserve echelonned behind the ambulance established at the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean, and of Vivian‚Äôs and Vandeleur‚Äôs brigades, which flanked the left wing, Wellington had no cavalry left. A number of batteries lay unhorsed. These facts are attested by Siborne; and Pringle, exaggerating the disaster, goes so far as to say that the Anglo-Dutch army was reduced to thirty-four thousand men. The Iron Duke remained calm, but his lips blanched. Vincent, the Austrian commissioner, Alava, the Spanish commissioner, who were present at the battle in the English staff, thought the Duke lost. At five o‚Äôclock Wellington drew out his watch, and he was heard to murmur these sinister words, ‚ÄúBl√ºcher, or night!‚Äù
U||It was at about that moment that a distant line of bayonets gleamed on the heights in the direction of Frischemont.
U||Here comes the change of face in this giant drama.
U||CHAPTER XI‚ÄîA BAD GUIDE TO NAPOLEON; A GOOD GUIDE TO B√úLOW
U||The painful surprise of Napoleon is well known. Grouchy hoped for, Bl√ºcher arriving. Death instead of life.
U||Fate has these turns; the throne of the world was expected; it was Saint Helena that was seen.
U||If the little shepherd who served as guide to B√ºlow, Bl√ºcher‚Äôs lieutenant, had advised him to debouch from the forest above Frischemont, instead of below Plancenoit, the form of the nineteenth century might, perhaps, have been different. Napoleon would have won the battle of Waterloo. By any other route than that below Plancenoit, the Prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable for artillery, and B√ºlow would not have arrived.
U||Now the Prussian general, Muffling, declares that one hour‚Äôs delay, and Bl√ºcher would not have found Wellington on his feet. ‚ÄúThe battle was lost.‚Äù
U||It was time that B√ºlow should arrive, as will be seen. He had, moreover, been very much delayed. He had bivouacked at Dion-le-Mont, and had set out at daybreak; but the roads were impassable, and his divisions stuck fast in the mire. The ruts were up to the hubs of the cannons. Moreover, he had been obliged to pass the Dyle on the narrow bridge of Wavre; the street leading to the bridge had been fired by the French, so the caissons and ammunition-wagons could not pass between two rows of burning houses, and had been obliged to wait until the conflagration was extinguished. It was midday before B√ºlow‚Äôs vanguard had been able to reach Chapelle-Saint-Lambert.
U||Had the action been begun two hours earlier, it would have been over at four o‚Äôclock, and Bl√ºcher would have fallen on the battle won by Napoleon. Such are these immense risks proportioned to an infinite which we cannot comprehend.
U||The Emperor had been the first, as early as midday, to descry with his field-glass, on the extreme horizon, something which had attracted his attention. He had said, ‚ÄúI see yonder a cloud, which seems to me to be troops.‚Äù Then he asked the Duc de Dalmatie, ‚ÄúSoult, what do you see in the direction of Chapelle-Saint-Lambert?‚Äù The marshal, levelling his glass, answered, ‚ÄúFour or five thousand men, Sire; evidently Grouchy.‚Äù But it remained motionless in the mist. All the glasses of the staff had studied ‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù pointed out by the Emperor. Some said: ‚ÄúIt is trees.‚Äù The truth is, that the cloud did not move. The Emperor detached Domon‚Äôs division of light cavalry to reconnoitre in that quarter.
U||B√ºlow had not moved, in fact. His vanguard was very feeble, and could accomplish nothing. He was obliged to wait for the body of the army corps, and he had received orders to concentrate his forces before entering into line; but at five o‚Äôclock, perceiving Wellington‚Äôs peril, Bl√ºcher ordered B√ºlow to attack, and uttered these remarkable words: ‚ÄúWe must give air to the English army.‚Äù
U||A little later, the divisions of Losthin, Hiller, Hacke, and Ryssel deployed before Lobau‚Äôs corps, the cavalry of Prince William of Prussia debouched from the forest of Paris, Plancenoit was in flames, and the Prussian cannon-balls began to rain even upon the ranks of the guard in reserve behind Napoleon.
U||CHAPTER XII‚ÄîTHE GUARD
U||Every one knows the rest,‚Äîthe irruption of a third army; the battle broken to pieces; eighty-six mouths of fire thundering simultaneously; Pirch the first coming up with B√ºlow; Zieten‚Äôs cavalry led by Bl√ºcher in person, the French driven back; Marcognet swept from the plateau of Ohain; Durutte dislodged from Papelotte; Donzelot and Quiot retreating; Lobau caught on the flank; a fresh battle precipitating itself on our dismantled regiments at nightfall; the whole English line resuming the offensive and thrust forward; the gigantic breach made in the French army; the English grape-shot and the Prussian grape-shot aiding each other; the extermination; disaster in front; disaster on the flank; the Guard entering the line in the midst of this terrible crumbling of all things.
U||Conscious that they were about to die, they shouted, ‚ÄúVive l‚ÄôEmpereur!‚Äù History records nothing more touching than that agony bursting forth in acclamations.
U||The sky had been overcast all day long. All of a sudden, at that very moment,‚Äîit was eight o‚Äôclock in the evening‚Äîthe clouds on the horizon parted, and allowed the grand and sinister glow of the setting sun to pass through, athwart the elms on the Nivelles road. They had seen it rise at Austerlitz.
U||Each battalion of the Guard was commanded by a general for this final catastrophe. Friant, Michel, Roguet, Harlet, Mallet, Poret de Morvan, were there. When the tall caps of the grenadiers of the Guard, with their large plaques bearing the eagle appeared, symmetrical, in line, tranquil, in the midst of that combat, the enemy felt a respect for France; they thought they beheld twenty victories entering the field of battle, with wings outspread, and those who were the conquerors, believing themselves to be vanquished, retreated; but Wellington shouted, ‚ÄúUp, Guards, and aim straight!‚Äù The red regiment of English guards, lying flat behind the hedges, sprang up, a cloud of grape-shot riddled the tricolored flag and whistled round our eagles; all hurled themselves forwards, and the final carnage began. In the darkness, the Imperial Guard felt the army losing ground around it, and in the vast shock of the rout it heard the desperate flight which had taken the place of the ‚ÄúVive l‚ÄôEmpereur!‚Äù and, with flig
U||ht behind it, it continued to advance, more crushed, losing more men at every step that it took. There were none who hesitated, no timid men in its ranks. The soldier in that troop was as much of a hero as the general. Not a man was missing in that suicide.
U||Ney, bewildered, great with all the grandeur of accepted death, offered himself to all blows in that tempest. He had his fifth horse killed under him there. Perspiring, his eyes aflame, foaming at the mouth, with uniform unbuttoned, one of his epaulets half cut off by a sword-stroke from a horseguard, his plaque with the great eagle dented by a bullet; bleeding, bemired, magnificent, a broken sword in his hand, he said, ‚ÄúCome and see how a Marshal of France dies on the field of battle!‚Äù But in vain; he did not die. He was haggard and angry. At Drouet d‚ÄôErlon he hurled this question, ‚ÄúAre you not going to get yourself killed?‚Äù In the midst of all that artillery engaged in crushing a handful of men, he shouted: ‚ÄúSo there is nothing for me! Oh! I should like to have all these English bullets enter my bowels!‚Äù Unhappy man, thou wert reserved for French bullets!
U||CHAPTER XIII‚ÄîTHE CATASTROPHE
U||The rout behind the Guard was melancholy.
U||The army yielded suddenly on all sides at once,‚ÄîHougomont, La Haie-Sainte, Papelotte, Plancenoit. The cry ‚ÄúTreachery!‚Äù was followed by a cry of ‚ÄúSave yourselves who can!‚Äù An army which is disbanding is like a thaw. All yields, splits, cracks, floats, rolls, falls, jostles, hastens, is precipitated. The disintegration is unprecedented. Ney borrows a horse, leaps upon it, and without hat, cravat, or sword, places himself across the Brussels road, stopping both English and French. He strives to detain the army, he recalls it to its duty, he insults it, he clings to the rout. He is overwhelmed. The soldiers fly from him, shouting, ‚ÄúLong live Marshal Ney!‚Äù Two of Durutte‚Äôs regiments go and come in affright as though tossed back and forth between the swords of the Uhlans and the fusillade of the brigades of Kempt, Best, Pack, and Rylandt; the worst of hand-to-hand conflicts is the defeat; friends kill each other in order to escape; squadrons and battalions break and disperse against each other, lik
U||e the tremendous foam of battle. Lobau at one extremity, and Reille at the other, are drawn into the tide. In vain does Napoleon erect walls from what is left to him of his Guard; in vain does he expend in a last effort his last serviceable squadrons. Quiot retreats before Vivian, Kellermann before Vandeleur, Lobau before B√ºlow, Morand before Pirch, Domon and Subervic before Prince William of Prussia; Guyot, who led the Emperor‚Äôs squadrons to the charge, falls beneath the feet of the English dragoons. Napoleon gallops past the line of fugitives, harangues, urges, threatens, entreats them. All the mouths which in the morning had shouted, ‚ÄúLong live the Emperor!‚Äù remain gaping; they hardly recognize him. The Prussian cavalry, newly arrived, dashes forwards, flies, hews, slashes, kills, exterminates. Horses lash out, the cannons flee; the soldiers of the artillery-train unharness the caissons and use the horses to make their escape; transports overturned, with all four wheels in the air, clog the road an
U||d occasion massacres. Men are crushed, trampled down, others walk over the dead and the living. Arms are lost. A dizzy multitude fills the roads, the paths, the bridges, the plains, the hills, the valleys, the woods, encumbered by this invasion of forty thousand men. Shouts despair, knapsacks and guns flung among the rye, passages forced at the point of the sword, no more comrades, no more officers, no more generals, an inexpressible terror. Zieten putting France to the sword at its leisure. Lions converted into goats. Such was the flight.
U||At Genappe, an effort was made to wheel about, to present a battle front, to draw up in line. Lobau rallied three hundred men. The entrance to the village was barricaded, but at the first volley of Prussian canister, all took to flight again, and Lobau was taken. That volley of grape-shot can be seen to-day imprinted on the ancient gable of a brick building on the right of the road at a few minutes‚Äô distance before you enter Genappe. The Prussians threw themselves into Genappe, furious, no doubt, that they were not more entirely the conquerors. The pursuit was stupendous. Bl√ºcher ordered extermination. Roguet had set the lugubrious example of threatening with death any French grenadier who should bring him a Prussian prisoner. Bl√ºcher outdid Roguet. Duhesme, the general of the Young Guard, hemmed in at the doorway of an inn at Genappe, surrendered his sword to a huzzar of death, who took the sword and slew the prisoner. The victory was completed by the assassination of the vanquished. Let us inflict puni
U||shment, since we are history: old Bl√ºcher disgraced himself. This ferocity put the finishing touch to the disaster. The desperate route traversed Genappe, traversed Quatre-Bras, traversed Gosselies, traversed Frasnes, traversed Charleroi, traversed Thuin, and only halted at the frontier. Alas! and who, then, was fleeing in that manner? The Grand Army.
U||This vertigo, this terror, this downfall into ruin of the loftiest bravery which ever astounded history,‚Äîis that causeless? No. The shadow of an enormous right is projected athwart Waterloo. It is the day of destiny. The force which is mightier than man produced that day. Hence the terrified wrinkle of those brows; hence all those great souls surrendering their swords. Those who had conquered Europe have fallen prone on the earth, with nothing left to say nor to do, feeling the present shadow of a terrible presence. Hoc erat in fatis. That day the perspective of the human race underwent a change. Waterloo is the hinge of the nineteenth century. The disappearance of the great man was necessary to the advent of the great century. Some one, a person to whom one replies not, took the responsibility on himself. The panic of heroes can be explained. In the battle of Waterloo there is something more than a cloud, there is something of the meteor. God has passed by.
U||At nightfall, in a meadow near Genappe, Bernard and Bertrand seized by the skirt of his coat and detained a man, haggard, pensive, sinister, gloomy, who, dragged to that point by the current of the rout, had just dismounted, had passed the bridle of his horse over his arm, and with wild eye was returning alone to Waterloo. It was Napoleon, the immense somnambulist of this dream which had crumbled, essaying once more to advance.
U||CHAPTER XIV‚ÄîTHE LAST SQUARE
U||Several squares of the Guard, motionless amid this stream of the defeat, as rocks in running water, held their own until night. Night came, death also; they awaited that double shadow, and, invincible, allowed themselves to be enveloped therein. Each regiment, isolated from the rest, and having no bond with the army, now shattered in every part, died alone. They had taken up position for this final action, some on the heights of Rossomme, others on the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean. There, abandoned, vanquished, terrible, those gloomy squares endured their death-throes in formidable fashion. Ulm, Wagram, Jena, Friedland, died with them.
U||At twilight, towards nine o‚Äôclock in the evening, one of them was left at the foot of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. In that fatal valley, at the foot of that declivity which the cuirassiers had ascended, now inundated by the masses of the English, under the converging fires of the victorious hostile cavalry, under a frightful density of projectiles, this square fought on. It was commanded by an obscure officer named Cambronne. At each discharge, the square diminished and replied. It replied to the grape-shot with a fusillade, continually contracting its four walls. The fugitives pausing breathless for a moment in the distance, listened in the darkness to that gloomy and ever-decreasing thunder.
U||When this legion had been reduced to a handful, when nothing was left of their flag but a rag, when their guns, the bullets all gone, were no longer anything but clubs, when the heap of corpses was larger than the group of survivors, there reigned among the conquerors, around those men dying so sublimely, a sort of sacred terror, and the English artillery, taking breath, became silent. This furnished a sort of respite. These combatants had around them something in the nature of a swarm of spectres, silhouettes of men on horseback, the black profiles of cannon, the white sky viewed through wheels and gun-carriages, the colossal death‚Äôs-head, which the heroes saw constantly through the smoke, in the depths of the battle, advanced upon them and gazed at them. Through the shades of twilight they could hear the pieces being loaded; the matches all lighted, like the eyes of tigers at night, formed a circle round their heads; all the lintstocks of the English batteries approached the cannons, and then, with emoti
U||on, holding the supreme moment suspended above these men, an English general, Colville according to some, Maitland according to others, shouted to them, ‚ÄúSurrender, brave Frenchmen!‚Äù Cambronne replied, ‚Äú‚Äî‚Äî.‚Äù
U||{EDITOR‚ÄôS COMMENTARY: Another edition of this book has the word ‚ÄúMerde!‚Äù in lieu of the ‚Äî‚Äî above.}
U||CHAPTER XV‚ÄîCAMBRONNE
U||If any French reader object to having his susceptibilities offended, one would have to refrain from repeating in his presence what is perhaps the finest reply that a Frenchman ever made. This would enjoin us from consigning something sublime to History.
U||At our own risk and peril, let us violate this injunction.
U||Now, then, among those giants there was one Titan,‚ÄîCambronne.
U||To make that reply and then perish, what could be grander? For being willing to die is the same as to die; and it was not this man‚Äôs fault if he survived after he was shot.
U||The winner of the battle of Waterloo was not Napoleon, who was put to flight; nor Wellington, giving way at four o‚Äôclock, in despair at five; nor Bl√ºcher, who took no part in the engagement. The winner of Waterloo was Cambronne.
U||To thunder forth such a reply at the lightning-flash that kills you is to conquer!
U||Thus to answer the Catastrophe, thus to speak to Fate, to give this pedestal to the future lion, to hurl such a challenge to the midnight rainstorm, to the treacherous wall of Hougomont, to the sunken road of Ohain, to Grouchy‚Äôs delay, to Bl√ºcher‚Äôs arrival, to be Irony itself in the tomb, to act so as to stand upright though fallen, to drown in two syllables the European coalition, to offer kings privies which the C√¶sars once knew, to make the lowest of words the most lofty by entwining with it the glory of France, insolently to end Waterloo with Mardigras, to finish Leonidas with Rabellais, to set the crown on this victory by a word impossible to speak, to lose the field and preserve history, to have the laugh on your side after such a carnage,‚Äîthis is immense!
U||It was an insult such as a thunder-cloud might hurl! It reaches the grandeur of √Üschylus!
U||Cambronne‚Äôs reply produces the effect of a violent break. ‚ÄôTis like the breaking of a heart under a weight of scorn. ‚ÄôTis the overflow of agony bursting forth. Who conquered? Wellington? No! Had it not been for Bl√ºcher, he was lost. Was it Bl√ºcher? No! If Wellington had not begun, Bl√ºcher could not have finished. This Cambronne, this man spending his last hour, this unknown soldier, this infinitesimal of war, realizes that here is a falsehood, a falsehood in a catastrophe, and so doubly agonizing; and at the moment when his rage is bursting forth because of it, he is offered this mockery,‚Äîlife! How could he restrain himself? Yonder are all the kings of Europe, the general‚Äôs flushed with victory, the Jupiter‚Äôs darting thunderbolts; they have a hundred thousand victorious soldiers, and back of the hundred thousand a million; their cannon stand with yawning mouths, the match is lighted; they grind down under their heels the Imperial guards, and the grand army; they have just crushed Napoleon, and
U|| only Cambronne remains,‚Äîonly this earthworm is left to protest. He will protest. Then he seeks for the appropriate word as one seeks for a sword. His mouth froths, and the froth is the word. In face of this mean and mighty victory, in face of this victory which counts none victorious, this desperate soldier stands erect. He grants its overwhelming immensity, but he establishes its triviality; and he does more than spit upon it. Borne down by numbers, by superior force, by brute matter, he finds in his soul an expression: ‚ÄúExcr√©ment!‚Äù We repeat it,‚Äîto use that word, to do thus, to invent such an expression, is to be the conqueror!
U||The spirit of mighty days at that portentous moment made its descent on that unknown man. Cambronne invents the word for Waterloo as Rouget invents the ‚ÄúMarseillaise,‚Äù under the visitation of a breath from on high. An emanation from the divine whirlwind leaps forth and comes sweeping over these men, and they shake, and one of them sings the song supreme, and the other utters the frightful cry.
U||This challenge of titanic scorn Cambronne hurls not only at Europe in the name of the Empire,‚Äîthat would be a trifle: he hurls it at the past in the name of the Revolution. It is heard, and Cambronne is recognized as possessed by the ancient spirit of the Titans. Danton seems to be speaking! Kl√©ber seems to be bellowing!
U||At that word from Cambronne, the English voice responded, ‚ÄúFire!‚Äù The batteries flamed, the hill trembled, from all those brazen mouths belched a last terrible gush of grape-shot; a vast volume of smoke, vaguely white in the light of the rising moon, rolled out, and when the smoke dispersed, there was no longer anything there. That formidable remnant had been annihilated; the Guard was dead. The four walls of the living redoubt lay prone, and hardly was there discernible, here and there, even a quiver in the bodies; it was thus that the French legions, greater than the Roman legions, expired on Mont-Saint-Jean, on the soil watered with rain and blood, amid the gloomy grain, on the spot where nowadays Joseph, who drives the post-wagon from Nivelles, passes whistling, and cheerfully whipping up his horse at four o‚Äôclock in the morning.
U||CHAPTER XVI‚ÄîQUOT LIBRAS IN DUCE?
U||The battle of Waterloo is an enigma. It is as obscure to those who won it as to those who lost it. For Napoleon it was a panic;10 Bl√ºcher sees nothing in it but fire; Wellington understands nothing in regard to it. Look at the reports. The bulletins are confused, the commentaries involved. Some stammer, others lisp. Jomini divides the battle of Waterloo into four moments; Muffling cuts it up into three changes; Charras alone, though we hold another judgment than his on some points, seized with his haughty glance the characteristic outlines of that catastrophe of human genius in conflict with divine chance. All the other historians suffer from being somewhat dazzled, and in this dazzled state they fumble about. It was a day of lightning brilliancy; in fact, a crumbling of the military monarchy which, to the vast stupefaction of kings, drew all the kingdoms after it‚Äîthe fall of force, the defeat of war.
U||In this event, stamped with superhuman necessity, the part played by men amounts to nothing.
U||If we take Waterloo from Wellington and Bl√ºcher, do we thereby deprive England and Germany of anything? No. Neither that illustrious England nor that august Germany enter into the problem of Waterloo. Thank Heaven, nations are great, independently of the lugubrious feats of the sword. Neither England, nor Germany, nor France is contained in a scabbard. At this epoch when Waterloo is only a clashing of swords, above Bl√ºcher, Germany has Schiller; above Wellington, England has Byron. A vast dawn of ideas is the peculiarity of our century, and in that aurora England and Germany have a magnificent radiance. They are majestic because they think. The elevation of level which they contribute to civilization is intrinsic with them; it proceeds from themselves and not from an accident. The aggrandizement which they have brought to the nineteenth century has not Waterloo as its source. It is only barbarous peoples who undergo rapid growth after a victory. That is the temporary vanity of torrents swelled by a storm. 
U||Civilized people, especially in our day, are neither elevated nor abased by the good or bad fortune of a captain. Their specific gravity in the human species results from something more than a combat. Their honor, thank God! their dignity, their intelligence, their genius, are not numbers which those gamblers, heroes and conquerors, can put in the lottery of battles. Often a battle is lost and progress is conquered. There is less glory and more liberty. The drum holds its peace; reason takes the word. It is a game in which he who loses wins. Let us, therefore, speak of Waterloo coldly from both sides. Let us render to chance that which is due to chance, and to God that which is due to God. What is Waterloo? A victory? No. The winning number in the lottery.
U||The quine 11 won by Europe, paid by France.
U||It was not worthwhile to place a lion there.
U||Waterloo, moreover, is the strangest encounter in history. Napoleon and Wellington. They are not enemies; they are opposites. Never did God, who is fond of antitheses, make a more striking contrast, a more extraordinary comparison. On one side, precision, foresight, geometry, prudence, an assured retreat, reserves spared, with an obstinate coolness, an imperturbable method, strategy, which takes advantage of the ground, tactics, which preserve the equilibrium of battalions, carnage, executed according to rule, war regulated, watch in hand, nothing voluntarily left to chance, the ancient classic courage, absolute regularity; on the other, intuition, divination, military oddity, superhuman instinct, a flaming glance, an indescribable something which gazes like an eagle, and which strikes like the lightning, a prodigious art in disdainful impetuosity, all the mysteries of a profound soul, associated with destiny; the stream, the plain, the forest, the hill, summoned, and in a manner, forced to obey, the despot 
U||going even so far as to tyrannize over the field of battle; faith in a star mingled with strategic science, elevating but perturbing it. Wellington was the Bar√™me of war; Napoleon was its Michael Angelo; and on this occasion, genius was vanquished by calculation. On both sides some one was awaited. It was the exact calculator who succeeded. Napoleon was waiting for Grouchy; he did not come. Wellington expected Bl√ºcher; he came.
U||Wellington is classic war taking its revenge. Bonaparte, at his dawning, had encountered him in Italy, and beaten him superbly. The old owl had fled before the young vulture. The old tactics had been not only struck as by lightning, but disgraced. Who was that Corsican of six and twenty? What signified that splendid ignoramus, who, with everything against him, nothing in his favor, without provisions, without ammunition, without cannon, without shoes, almost without an army, with a mere handful of men against masses, hurled himself on Europe combined, and absurdly won victories in the impossible? Whence had issued that fulminating convict, who almost without taking breath, and with the same set of combatants in hand, pulverized, one after the other, the five armies of the emperor of Germany, upsetting Beaulieu on Alvinzi, Wurmser on Beaulieu, M√©las on Wurmser, Mack on M√©las? Who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary? The academical military school excommunicated him, and as it lost its f
U||ooting; hence, the implacable rancor of the old C√¶sarism against the new; of the regular sword against the flaming sword; and of the exchequer against genius. On the 18th of June, 1815, that rancor had the last word, and beneath Lodi, Montebello, Montenotte, Mantua, Arcola, it wrote: Waterloo. A triumph of the mediocres which is sweet to the majority. Destiny consented to this irony. In his decline, Napoleon found Wurmser, the younger, again in front of him.
U||In fact, to get Wurmser, it sufficed to blanch the hair of Wellington.
U||Waterloo is a battle of the first order, won by a captain of the second.
U||That which must be admired in the battle of Waterloo, is England; the English firmness, the English resolution, the English blood; the superb thing about England there, no offence to her, was herself. It was not her captain; it was her army.
U||Wellington, oddly ungrateful, declares in a letter to Lord Bathurst, that his army, the army which fought on the 18th of June, 1815, was a ‚Äúdetestable army.‚Äù What does that sombre intermingling of bones buried beneath the furrows of Waterloo think of that?
U||England has been too modest in the matter of Wellington. To make Wellington so great is to belittle England. Wellington is nothing but a hero like many another. Those Scotch Grays, those Horse Guards, those regiments of Maitland and of Mitchell, that infantry of Pack and Kempt, that cavalry of Ponsonby and Somerset, those Highlanders playing the pibroch under the shower of grape-shot, those battalions of Rylandt, those utterly raw recruits, who hardly knew how to handle a musket holding their own against Essling‚Äôs and Rivoli‚Äôs old troops,‚Äîthat is what was grand. Wellington was tenacious; in that lay his merit, and we are not seeking to lessen it: but the least of his foot-soldiers and of his cavalry would have been as solid as he. The iron soldier is worth as much as the Iron Duke. As for us, all our glorification goes to the English soldier, to the English army, to the English people. If trophy there be, it is to England that the trophy is due. The column of Waterloo would be more just, if, instead of
U|| the figure of a man, it bore on high the statue of a people.
U||But this great England will be angry at what we are saying here. She still cherishes, after her own 1688 and our 1789, the feudal illusion. She believes in heredity and hierarchy. This people, surpassed by none in power and glory, regards itself as a nation, and not as a people. And as a people, it willingly subordinates itself and takes a lord for its head. As a workman, it allows itself to be disdained; as a soldier, it allows itself to be flogged.
U||It will be remembered, that at the battle of Inkermann a sergeant who had, it appears, saved the army, could not be mentioned by Lord Paglan, as the English military hierarchy does not permit any hero below the grade of an officer to be mentioned in the reports.
U||That which we admire above all, in an encounter of the nature of Waterloo, is the marvellous cleverness of chance. A nocturnal rain, the wall of Hougomont, the hollow road of Ohain, Grouchy deaf to the cannon, Napoleon‚Äôs guide deceiving him, B√ºlow‚Äôs guide enlightening him,‚Äîthe whole of this cataclysm is wonderfully conducted.
U||On the whole, let us say it plainly, it was more of a massacre than of a battle at Waterloo.
U||Of all pitched battles, Waterloo is the one which has the smallest front for such a number of combatants. Napoleon three-quarters of a league; Wellington, half a league; seventy-two thousand combatants on each side. From this denseness the carnage arose.
U||The following calculation has been made, and the following proportion established: Loss of men: at Austerlitz, French, fourteen per cent; Russians, thirty per cent; Austrians, forty-four per cent. At Wagram, French, thirteen per cent; Austrians, fourteen. At the Moskowa, French, thirty-seven per cent; Russians, forty-four. At Bautzen, French, thirteen per cent; Russians and Prussians, fourteen. At Waterloo, French, fifty-six per cent; the Allies, thirty-one. Total for Waterloo, forty-one per cent; one hundred and forty-four thousand combatants; sixty thousand dead.
U||To-day the field of Waterloo has the calm which belongs to the earth, the impassive support of man, and it resembles all plains.
U||At night, moreover, a sort of visionary mist arises from it; and if a traveller strolls there, if he listens, if he watches, if he dreams like Virgil in the fatal plains of Philippi, the hallucination of the catastrophe takes possession of him. The frightful 18th of June lives again; the false monumental hillock disappears, the lion vanishes in air, the battle-field resumes its reality, lines of infantry undulate over the plain, furious gallops traverse the horizon; the frightened dreamer beholds the flash of sabres, the gleam of bayonets, the flare of bombs, the tremendous interchange of thunders; he hears, as it were, the death rattle in the depths of a tomb, the vague clamor of the battle phantom; those shadows are grenadiers, those lights are cuirassiers; that skeleton Napoleon, that other skeleton is Wellington; all this no longer exists, and yet it clashes together and combats still; and the ravines are empurpled, and the trees quiver, and there is fury even in the clouds and in the shadows; all those 
U||terrible heights, Hougomont, Mont-Saint-Jean, Frischemont, Papelotte, Plancenoit, appear confusedly crowned with whirlwinds of spectres engaged in exterminating each other.
U||CHAPTER XVII‚ÄîIS WATERLOO TO BE CONSIDERED GOOD?
U||There exists a very respectable liberal school which does not hate Waterloo. We do not belong to it. To us, Waterloo is but the stupefied date of liberty. That such an eagle should emerge from such an egg is certainly unexpected.
U||If one places one‚Äôs self at the culminating point of view of the question, Waterloo is intentionally a counter-revolutionary victory. It is Europe against France; it is Petersburg, Berlin, and Vienna against Paris; it is the statu quo against the initiative; it is the 14th of July, 1789, attacked through the 20th of March, 1815; it is the monarchies clearing the decks in opposition to the indomitable French rioting. The final extinction of that vast people which had been in eruption for twenty-six years‚Äîsuch was the dream. The solidarity of the Brunswicks, the Nassaus, the Romanoffs, the Hohenzollerns, the Hapsburgs with the Bourbons. Waterloo bears divine right on its crupper. It is true, that the Empire having been despotic, the kingdom by the natural reaction of things, was forced to be liberal, and that a constitutional order was the unwilling result of Waterloo, to the great regret of the conquerors. It is because revolution cannot be really conquered, and that being providential and absolutely fata
U||l, it is always cropping up afresh: before Waterloo, in Bonaparte overthrowing the old thrones; after Waterloo, in Louis XVIII. granting and conforming to the charter. Bonaparte places a postilion on the throne of Naples, and a sergeant on the throne of Sweden, employing inequality to demonstrate equality; Louis XVIII. at Saint-Ouen countersigns the declaration of the rights of man. If you wish to gain an idea of what revolution is, call it Progress; and if you wish to acquire an idea of the nature of progress, call it To-morrow. To-morrow fulfils its work irresistibly, and it is already fulfilling it to-day. It always reaches its goal strangely. It employs Wellington to make of Foy, who was only a soldier, an orator. Foy falls at Hougomont and rises again in the tribune. Thus does progress proceed. There is no such thing as a bad tool for that workman. It does not become disconcerted, but adjusts to its divine work the man who has bestridden the Alps, and the good old tottering invalid of Father √âlys√©e. I
U||t makes use of the gouty man as well as of the conqueror; of the conqueror without, of the gouty man within. Waterloo, by cutting short the demolition of European thrones by the sword, had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be continued in another direction. The slashers have finished; it was the turn of the thinkers. The century that Waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued its march. That sinister victory was vanquished by liberty.
U||In short, and incontestably, that which triumphed at Waterloo; that which smiled in Wellington‚Äôs rear; that which brought him all the marshals‚Äô staffs of Europe, including, it is said, the staff of a marshal of France; that which joyously trundled the barrows full of bones to erect the knoll of the lion; that which triumphantly inscribed on that pedestal the date ‚ÄúJune 18, 1815‚Äù; that which encouraged Bl√ºcher, as he put the flying army to the sword; that which, from the heights of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, hovered over France as over its prey, was the counter-revolution. It was the counter-revolution which murmured that infamous word ‚Äúdismemberment.‚Äù On arriving in Paris, it beheld the crater close at hand; it felt those ashes which scorched its feet, and it changed its mind; it returned to the stammer of a charter.
U||Let us behold in Waterloo only that which is in Waterloo. Of intentional liberty there is none. The counter-revolution was involuntarily liberal, in the same manner as, by a corresponding phenomenon, Napoleon was involuntarily revolutionary. On the 18th of June, 1815, the mounted Robespierre was hurled from his saddle.
U||CHAPTER XVIII‚ÄîA RECRUDESCENCE OF DIVINE RIGHT
U||End of the dictatorship. A whole European system crumbled away.
U||The Empire sank into a gloom which resembled that of the Roman world as it expired. Again we behold the abyss, as in the days of the barbarians; only the barbarism of 1815, which must be called by its pet name of the counter-revolution, was not long breathed, soon fell to panting, and halted short. The Empire was bewept,‚Äîlet us acknowledge the fact,‚Äîand bewept by heroic eyes. If glory lies in the sword converted into a sceptre, the Empire had been glory in person. It had diffused over the earth all the light which tyranny can give‚Äîa sombre light. We will say more; an obscure light. Compared to the true daylight, it is night. This disappearance of night produces the effect of an eclipse.
U||Louis XVIII. re-entered Paris. The circling dances of the 8th of July effaced the enthusiasms of the 20th of March. The Corsican became the antithesis of the Bearnese. The flag on the dome of the Tuileries was white. The exile reigned. Hartwell‚Äôs pine table took its place in front of the fleur-de-lys-strewn throne of Louis XIV. Bouvines and Fontenoy were mentioned as though they had taken place on the preceding day, Austerlitz having become antiquated. The altar and the throne fraternized majestically. One of the most undisputed forms of the health of society in the nineteenth century was established over France, and over the continent. Europe adopted the white cockade. Trestaillon was celebrated. The device non pluribus impar reappeared on the stone rays representing a sun upon the front of the barracks on the Quai d‚ÄôOrsay. Where there had been an Imperial Guard, there was now a red house. The Arc du Carrousel, all laden with badly borne victories, thrown out of its element among these novelties, a litt
U||le ashamed, it may be, of Marengo and Arcola, extricated itself from its predicament with the statue of the Duc d‚ÄôAngoul√™me. The cemetery of the Madeleine, a terrible pauper‚Äôs grave in 1793, was covered with jasper and marble, since the bones of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette lay in that dust.
U||In the moat of Vincennes a sepulchral shaft sprang from the earth, recalling the fact that the Duc d‚ÄôEnghien had perished in the very month when Napoleon was crowned. Pope Pius VII., who had performed the coronation very near this death, tranquilly bestowed his blessing on the fall as he had bestowed it on the elevation. At Schoenbrunn there was a little shadow, aged four, whom it was seditious to call the King of Rome. And these things took place, and the kings resumed their thrones, and the master of Europe was put in a cage, and the old regime became the new regime, and all the shadows and all the light of the earth changed place, because, on the afternoon of a certain summer‚Äôs day, a shepherd said to a Prussian in the forest, ‚ÄúGo this way, and not that!‚Äù
U||This 1815 was a sort of lugubrious April. Ancient unhealthy and poisonous realities were covered with new appearances. A lie wedded 1789; the right divine was masked under a charter; fictions became constitutional; prejudices, superstitions and mental reservations, with Article 14 in the heart, were varnished over with liberalism. It was the serpent‚Äôs change of skin.
U||Man had been rendered both greater and smaller by Napoleon. Under this reign of splendid matter, the ideal had received the strange name of ideology! It is a grave imprudence in a great man to turn the future into derision. The populace, however, that food for cannon which is so fond of the cannoneer, sought him with its glance. Where is he? What is he doing? ‚ÄúNapoleon is dead,‚Äù said a passer-by to a veteran of Marengo and Waterloo. ‚ÄúHe dead!‚Äù cried the soldier; ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know him.‚Äù Imagination distrusted this man, even when overthrown. The depths of Europe were full of darkness after Waterloo. Something enormous remained long empty through Napoleon‚Äôs disappearance.
U||The kings placed themselves in this void. Ancient Europe profited by it to undertake reforms. There was a Holy Alliance; Belle-Alliance, Beautiful Alliance, the fatal field of Waterloo had said in advance.
U||In presence and in face of that antique Europe reconstructed, the features of a new France were sketched out. The future, which the Emperor had rallied, made its entry. On its brow it bore the star, Liberty. The glowing eyes of all young generations were turned on it. Singular fact! people were, at one and the same time, in love with the future, Liberty, and the past, Napoleon. Defeat had rendered the vanquished greater. Bonaparte fallen seemed more lofty than Napoleon erect. Those who had triumphed were alarmed. England had him guarded by Hudson Lowe, and France had him watched by Montchenu. His folded arms became a source of uneasiness to thrones. Alexander called him ‚Äúmy sleeplessness.‚Äù This terror was the result of the quantity of revolution which was contained in him. That is what explains and excuses Bonapartist liberalism. This phantom caused the old world to tremble. The kings reigned, but ill at their ease, with the rock of Saint Helena on the horizon.
U||While Napoleon was passing through the death struggle at Longwood, the sixty thousand men who had fallen on the field of Waterloo were quietly rotting, and something of their peace was shed abroad over the world. The Congress of Vienna made the treaties in 1815, and Europe called this the Restoration.
U||This is what Waterloo was.
U||But what matters it to the Infinite? all that tempest, all that cloud, that war, then that peace? All that darkness did not trouble for a moment the light of that immense Eye before which a grub skipping from one blade of grass to another equals the eagle soaring from belfry to belfry on the towers of Notre Dame.
U||CHAPTER XIX‚ÄîTHE BATTLE-FIELD AT NIGHT
U||Let us return‚Äîit is a necessity in this book‚Äîto that fatal battle-field.
U||On the 18th of June the moon was full. Its light favored Bl√ºcher‚Äôs ferocious pursuit, betrayed the traces of the fugitives, delivered up that disastrous mass to the eager Prussian cavalry, and aided the massacre. Such tragic favors of the night do occur sometimes during catastrophes.
U||After the last cannon-shot had been fired, the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean remained deserted.
U||The English occupied the encampment of the French; it is the usual sign of victory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished. They established their bivouac beyond Rossomme. The Prussians, let loose on the retreating rout, pushed forward. Wellington went to the village of Waterloo to draw up his report to Lord Bathurst.
U||If ever the sic vos non vobis was applicable, it certainly is to that village of Waterloo. Waterloo took no part, and lay half a league from the scene of action. Mont-Saint-Jean was cannonaded, Hougomont was burned, La Haie-Sainte was taken by assault, Papelotte was burned, Plancenoit was burned, La Belle-Alliance beheld the embrace of the two conquerors; these names are hardly known, and Waterloo, which worked not in the battle, bears off all the honor.
U||We are not of the number of those who flatter war; when the occasion presents itself, we tell the truth about it. War has frightful beauties which we have not concealed; it has also, we acknowledge, some hideous features. One of the most surprising is the prompt stripping of the bodies of the dead after the victory. The dawn which follows a battle always rises on naked corpses.
U||Who does this? Who thus soils the triumph? What hideous, furtive hand is that which is slipped into the pocket of victory? What pickpockets are they who ply their trade in the rear of glory? Some philosophers‚ÄîVoltaire among the number‚Äîaffirm that it is precisely those persons who have made the glory. It is the same men, they say; there is no relief corps; those who are erect pillage those who are prone on the earth. The hero of the day is the vampire of the night. One has assuredly the right, after all, to strip a corpse a bit when one is the author of that corpse. For our own part, we do not think so; it seems to us impossible that the same hand should pluck laurels and purloin the shoes from a dead man.
U||One thing is certain, which is, that generally after conquerors follow thieves. But let us leave the soldier, especially the contemporary soldier, out of the question.
U||Every army has a rear-guard, and it is that which must be blamed. Bat-like creatures, half brigands and lackeys; all the sorts of vespertillos that that twilight called war engenders; wearers of uniforms, who take no part in the fighting; pretended invalids; formidable limpers; interloping sutlers, trotting along in little carts, sometimes accompanied by their wives, and stealing things which they sell again; beggars offering themselves as guides to officers; soldiers‚Äô servants; marauders; armies on the march in days gone by,‚Äîwe are not speaking of the present,‚Äîdragged all this behind them, so that in the special language they are called ‚Äústragglers.‚Äù No army, no nation, was responsible for those beings; they spoke Italian and followed the Germans, then spoke French and followed the English. It was by one of these wretches, a Spanish straggler who spoke French, that the Marquis of Fervacques, deceived by his Picard jargon, and taking him for one of our own men, was traitorously slain and robbed on 
U||the battle-field itself, in the course of the night which followed the victory of Cerisoles. The rascal sprang from this marauding. The detestable maxim, Live on the enemy! produced this leprosy, which a strict discipline alone could heal. There are reputations which are deceptive; one does not always know why certain generals, great in other directions, have been so popular. Turenne was adored by his soldiers because he tolerated pillage; evil permitted constitutes part of goodness. Turenne was so good that he allowed the Palatinate to be delivered over to fire and blood. The marauders in the train of an army were more or less in number, according as the chief was more or less severe. Hoche and Marceau had no stragglers; Wellington had few, and we do him the justice to mention it.
U||Nevertheless, on the night from the 18th to the 19th of June, the dead were robbed. Wellington was rigid; he gave orders that any one caught in the act should be shot; but rapine is tenacious. The marauders stole in one corner of the battlefield while others were being shot in another.
U||The moon was sinister over this plain.
U||Towards midnight, a man was prowling about, or rather, climbing in the direction of the hollow road of Ohain. To all appearance he was one of those whom we have just described,‚Äîneither English nor French, neither peasant nor soldier, less a man than a ghoul attracted by the scent of the dead bodies having theft for his victory, and come to rifle Waterloo. He was clad in a blouse that was something like a great coat; he was uneasy and audacious; he walked forwards and gazed behind him. Who was this man? The night probably knew more of him than the day. He had no sack, but evidently he had large pockets under his coat. From time to time he halted, scrutinized the plain around him as though to see whether he were observed, bent over abruptly, disturbed something silent and motionless on the ground, then rose and fled. His sliding motion, his attitudes, his mysterious and rapid gestures, caused him to resemble those twilight larv√¶ which haunt ruins, and which ancient Norman legends call the Alleurs.
U||Certain nocturnal wading birds produce these silhouettes among the marshes.
U||A glance capable of piercing all that mist deeply would have perceived at some distance a sort of little sutler‚Äôs wagon with a fluted wicker hood, harnessed to a famished nag which was cropping the grass across its bit as it halted, hidden, as it were, behind the hovel which adjoins the highway to Nivelles, at the angle of the road from Mont-Saint-Jean to Braine l‚ÄôAlleud; and in the wagon, a sort of woman seated on coffers and packages. Perhaps there was some connection between that wagon and that prowler.
U||The darkness was serene. Not a cloud in the zenith. What matters it if the earth be red! the moon remains white; these are the indifferences of the sky. In the fields, branches of trees broken by grape-shot, but not fallen, upheld by their bark, swayed gently in the breeze of night. A breath, almost a respiration, moved the shrubbery. Quivers which resembled the departure of souls ran through the grass.
U||In the distance the coming and going of patrols and the general rounds of the English camp were audible.
U||Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte continued to burn, forming, one in the west, the other in the east, two great flames which were joined by the cordon of bivouac fires of the English, like a necklace of rubies with two carbuncles at the extremities, as they extended in an immense semicircle over the hills along the horizon.
U||We have described the catastrophe of the road of Ohain. The heart is terrified at the thought of what that death must have been to so many brave men.
U||If there is anything terrible, if there exists a reality which surpasses dreams, it is this: to live, to see the sun; to be in full possession of virile force; to possess health and joy; to laugh valiantly; to rush towards a glory which one sees dazzling in front of one; to feel in one‚Äôs breast lungs which breathe, a heart which beats, a will which reasons; to speak, think, hope, love; to have a mother, to have a wife, to have children; to have the light‚Äîand all at once, in the space of a shout, in less than a minute, to sink into an abyss; to fall, to roll, to crush, to be crushed; to see ears of wheat, flowers, leaves, branches; not to be able to catch hold of anything; to feel one‚Äôs sword useless, men beneath one, horses on top of one; to struggle in vain, since one‚Äôs bones have been broken by some kick in the darkness; to feel a heel which makes one‚Äôs eyes start from their sockets; to bite horses‚Äô shoes in one‚Äôs rage; to stifle, to yell, to writhe; to be beneath, and to say to one‚Äôs self,
U|| ‚ÄúBut just a little while ago I was a living man!‚Äù
U||There, where that lamentable disaster had uttered its death-rattle, all was silence now. The edges of the hollow road were encumbered with horses and riders, inextricably heaped up. Terrible entanglement! There was no longer any slope, for the corpses had levelled the road with the plain, and reached the brim like a well-filled bushel of barley. A heap of dead bodies in the upper part, a river of blood in the lower part‚Äîsuch was that road on the evening of the 18th of June, 1815. The blood ran even to the Nivelles highway, and there overflowed in a large pool in front of the abatis of trees which barred the way, at a spot which is still pointed out.
U||It will be remembered that it was at the opposite point, in the direction of the Genappe road, that the destruction of the cuirassiers had taken place. The thickness of the layer of bodies was proportioned to the depth of the hollow road. Towards the middle, at the point where it became level, where Delort‚Äôs division had passed, the layer of corpses was thinner.
U||The nocturnal prowler whom we have just shown to the reader was going in that direction. He was searching that vast tomb. He gazed about. He passed the dead in some sort of hideous review. He walked with his feet in the blood.
U||All at once he paused.
U||A few paces in front of him, in the hollow road, at the point where the pile of dead came to an end, an open hand, illumined by the moon, projected from beneath that heap of men. That hand had on its finger something sparkling, which was a ring of gold.
U||The man bent over, remained in a crouching attitude for a moment, and when he rose there was no longer a ring on the hand.
U||He did not precisely rise; he remained in a stooping and frightened attitude, with his back turned to the heap of dead, scanning the horizon on his knees, with the whole upper portion of his body supported on his two forefingers, which rested on the earth, and his head peering above the edge of the hollow road. The jackal‚Äôs four paws suit some actions.
U||Then coming to a decision, he rose to his feet.
U||At that moment, he gave a terrible start. He felt some one clutch him from behind.
U||He wheeled round; it was the open hand, which had closed, and had seized the skirt of his coat.
U||An honest man would have been terrified; this man burst into a laugh.
U||‚ÄúCome,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúit‚Äôs only a dead body. I prefer a spook to a gendarme.‚Äù
U||But the hand weakened and released him. Effort is quickly exhausted in the grave.
U||‚ÄúWell now,‚Äù said the prowler, ‚Äúis that dead fellow alive? Let‚Äôs see.‚Äù
U||He bent down again, fumbled among the heap, pushed aside everything that was in his way, seized the hand, grasped the arm, freed the head, pulled out the body, and a few moments later he was dragging the lifeless, or at least the unconscious, man, through the shadows of hollow road. He was a cuirassier, an officer, and even an officer of considerable rank; a large gold epaulette peeped from beneath the cuirass; this officer no longer possessed a helmet. A furious sword-cut had scarred his face, where nothing was discernible but blood.
U||However, he did not appear to have any broken limbs, and, by some happy chance, if that word is permissible here, the dead had been vaulted above him in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed. His eyes were still closed.
U||On his cuirass he wore the silver cross of the Legion of Honor.
U||The prowler tore off this cross, which disappeared into one of the gulfs which he had beneath his great coat.
U||Then he felt of the officer‚Äôs fob, discovered a watch there, and took possession of it. Next he searched his waistcoat, found a purse and pocketed it.
U||When he had arrived at this stage of succor which he was administering to this dying man, the officer opened his eyes.
U||‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù he said feebly.
U||The abruptness of the movements of the man who was manipulating him, the freshness of the night, the air which he could inhale freely, had roused him from his lethargy.
U||The prowler made no reply. He raised his head. A sound of footsteps was audible in the plain; some patrol was probably approaching.
U||The officer murmured, for the death agony was still in his voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWho won the battle?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe English,‚Äù answered the prowler.
U||The officer went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLook in my pockets; you will find a watch and a purse. Take them.‚Äù
U||It was already done.
U||The prowler executed the required feint, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThere is nothing there.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have been robbed,‚Äù said the officer; ‚ÄúI am sorry for that. You should have had them.‚Äù
U||The steps of the patrol became more and more distinct.
U||‚ÄúSome one is coming,‚Äù said the prowler, with the movement of a man who is taking his departure.
U||The officer raised his arm feebly, and detained him.
U||‚ÄúYou have saved my life. Who are you?‚Äù
U||The prowler answered rapidly, and in a low voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLike yourself, I belonged to the French army. I must leave you. If they were to catch me, they would shoot me. I have saved your life. Now get out of the scrape yourself.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is your rank?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSergeant.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTh√©nardier.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI shall not forget that name,‚Äù said the officer; ‚Äúand do you remember mine. My name is Pontmercy.‚Äù
U||BOOK SECOND‚ÄîTHE SHIP ORION
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîNUMBER 24,601 BECOMES NUMBER 9,430
U||Jean Valjean had been recaptured.
U||The reader will be grateful to us if we pass rapidly over the sad details. We will confine ourselves to transcribing two paragraphs published by the journals of that day, a few months after the surprising events which had taken place at M. sur M.
U||These articles are rather summary. It must be remembered, that at that epoch the Gazette des Tribunaux was not yet in existence.
U||We borrow the first from the Drapeau Blanc. It bears the date of July 25, 1823.
U||An arrondissement of the Pas de Calais has just been the theatre of an event quite out of the ordinary course. A man, who was a stranger in the Department, and who bore the name of M. Madeleine, had, thanks to the new methods, resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry, the manufacture of jet and of black glass trinkets. He had made his fortune in the business, and that of the arrondissement as well, we will admit. He had been appointed mayor, in recognition of his services. The police discovered that M. Madeleine was no other than an ex-convict who had broken his ban, condemned in 1796 for theft, and named Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean has been recommitted to prison. It appears that previous to his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of M. Laffitte, a sum of over half a million which he had lodged there, and which he had, moreover, and by perfectly legitimate means, acquired in his business. No one has been able to discover where Jean Valjean has concealed this money since his retu
U||rn to prison at Toulon.
U||The second article, which enters a little more into detail, is an extract from the Journal de Paris, of the same date.
U||A former convict, who had been liberated, named Jean Valjean, has just appeared before the Court of Assizes of the Var, under circumstances calculated to attract attention. This wretch had succeeded in escaping the vigilance of the police, he had changed his name, and had succeeded in getting himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern towns; in this town he had established a considerable commerce. He has at last been unmasked and arrested, thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the public prosecutor. He had for his concubine a woman of the town, who died of a shock at the moment of his arrest. This scoundrel, who is endowed with Herculean strength, found means to escape; but three or four days after his flight the police laid their hands on him once more, in Paris itself, at the very moment when he was entering one of those little vehicles which run between the capital and the village of Montfermeil (Seine-et-Oise). He is said to have profited by this interval of three or four days of liberty, to with
U||draw a considerable sum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers. This sum has been estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs. If the indictment is to be trusted, he has hidden it in some place known to himself alone, and it has not been possible to lay hands on it. However that may be, the said Jean Valjean has just been brought before the Assizes of the Department of the Var as accused of highway robbery accompanied with violence, about eight years ago, on the person of one of those honest children who, as the patriarch of Ferney has said, in immortal verse,
U||‚Äú. . . Arrive from Savoy every year,
U||And who, with gentle hands, do clear
U||Those long canals choked up with soot.‚Äù
U||This bandit refused to defend himself. It was proved by the skilful and eloquent representative of the public prosecutor, that the theft was committed in complicity with others, and that Jean Valjean was a member of a band of robbers in the south. Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty and was condemned to the death penalty in consequence. This criminal refused to lodge an appeal. The king, in his inexhaustible clemency, has deigned to commute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life. Jean Valjean was immediately taken to the prison at Toulon.
U||The reader has not forgotten that Jean Valjean had religious habits at M. sur M. Some papers, among others the Constitutional, presented this commutation as a triumph of the priestly party.
U||Jean Valjean changed his number in the galleys. He was called 9,430.
U||However, and we will mention it at once in order that we may not be obliged to recur to the subject, the prosperity of M. sur M. vanished with M. Madeleine; all that he had foreseen during his night of fever and hesitation was realized; lacking him, there actually was a soul lacking. After this fall, there took place at M. sur M. that egotistical division of great existences which have fallen, that fatal dismemberment of flourishing things which is accomplished every day, obscurely, in the human community, and which history has noted only once, because it occurred after the death of Alexander. Lieutenants are crowned kings; superintendents improvise manufacturers out of themselves. Envious rivalries arose. M. Madeleine‚Äôs vast workshops were shut; his buildings fell to ruin, his workmen were scattered. Some of them quitted the country, others abandoned the trade. Thenceforth, everything was done on a small scale, instead of on a grand scale; for lucre instead of the general good. There was no longer a centr
U||e; everywhere there was competition and animosity. M. Madeleine had reigned over all and directed all. No sooner had he fallen, than each pulled things to himself; the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit of organization, bitterness to cordiality, hatred of one another to the benevolence of the founder towards all; the threads which M. Madeleine had set were tangled and broken, the methods were adulterated, the products were debased, confidence was killed; the market diminished, for lack of orders; salaries were reduced, the workshops stood still, bankruptcy arrived. And then there was nothing more for the poor. All had vanished.
U||The state itself perceived that some one had been crushed somewhere. Less than four years after the judgment of the Court of Assizes establishing the identity of Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine, for the benefit of the galleys, the cost of collecting taxes had doubled in the arrondissement of M. sur M.; and M. de Vill√®le called attention to the fact in the rostrum, in the month of February, 1827.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîIN WHICH THE READER WILL PERUSE TWO VERSES, WHICH ARE OF THE DEVIL‚ÄôS COMPOSITION, POSSIBLY
U||Before proceeding further, it will be to the purpose to narrate in some detail, a singular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch, in Montfermeil, and which is not lacking in coincidence with certain conjectures of the indictment.
U||There exists in the region of Montfermeil a very ancient superstition, which is all the more curious and all the more precious, because a popular superstition in the vicinity of Paris is like an aloe in Siberia. We are among those who respect everything which is in the nature of a rare plant. Here, then, is the superstition of Montfermeil: it is thought that the devil, from time immemorial, has selected the forest as a hiding-place for his treasures. Goodwives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall, in secluded nooks of the forest, a black man with the air of a carter or a wood-chopper, wearing wooden shoes, clad in trousers and a blouse of linen, and recognizable by the fact, that, instead of a cap or hat, he has two immense horns on his head. This ought, in fact, to render him recognizable. This man is habitually engaged in digging a hole. There are three ways of profiting by such an encounter. The first is to approach the man and speak to him. Then it is seen that the man is simply a peasan
U||t, that he appears black because it is nightfall; that he is not digging any hole whatever, but is cutting grass for his cows, and that what had been taken for horns is nothing but a dung-fork which he is carrying on his back, and whose teeth, thanks to the perspective of evening, seemed to spring from his head. The man returns home and dies within the week. The second way is to watch him, to wait until he has dug his hole, until he has filled it and has gone away; then to run with great speed to the trench, to open it once more and to seize the ‚Äútreasure‚Äù which the black man has necessarily placed there. In this case one dies within the month. Finally, the last method is not to speak to the black man, not to look at him, and to flee at the best speed of one‚Äôs legs. One then dies within the year.
U||As all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences, the second, which at all events, presents some advantages, among others that of possessing a treasure, if only for a month, is the one most generally adopted. So bold men, who are tempted by every chance, have quite frequently, as we are assured, opened the holes excavated by the black man, and tried to rob the devil. The success of the operation appears to be but moderate. At least, if the tradition is to be believed, and in particular the two enigmatical lines in barbarous Latin, which an evil Norman monk, a bit of a sorcerer, named Tryphon has left on this subject. This Tryphon is buried at the Abbey of Saint-Georges de Bocherville, near Rouen, and toads spawn on his grave.
U||Accordingly, enormous efforts are made. Such trenches are ordinarily extremely deep; a man sweats, digs, toils all night‚Äîfor it must be done at night; he wets his shirt, burns out his candle, breaks his mattock, and when he arrives at the bottom of the hole, when he lays his hand on the ‚Äútreasure,‚Äù what does he find? What is the devil‚Äôs treasure? A sou, sometimes a crown-piece, a stone, a skeleton, a bleeding body, sometimes a spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in a portfolio, sometimes nothing. This is what Tryphon‚Äôs verses seem to announce to the indiscreet and curious:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFodit, et in fossa thesauros condit opaca,
U||As, nummas, lapides, cadaver, simulacra, nihilque.‚Äù
U||It seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder-horn with bullets, sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn, which has evidently served the devil. Tryphon does not record these two finds, since Tryphon lived in the twelfth century, and since the devil does not appear to have had the wit to invent powder before Roger Bacon‚Äôs time, and cards before the time of Charles VI.
U||Moreover, if one plays at cards, one is sure to lose all that one possesses! and as for the powder in the horn, it possesses the property of making your gun burst in your face.
U||Now, a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecuting attorney that the liberated convict Jean Valjean during his flight of several days had been prowling around Montfermeil, it was remarked in that village that a certain old road-laborer, named Boulatruelle, had ‚Äúpeculiar ways‚Äù in the forest. People thereabouts thought they knew that this Boulatruelle had been in the galleys. He was subjected to certain police supervision, and, as he could find work nowhere, the administration employed him at reduced rates as a road-mender on the crossroad from Gagny to Lagny.
U||This Boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by the inhabitants of the district as too respectful, too humble, too prompt in removing his cap to every one, and trembling and smiling in the presence of the gendarmes,‚Äîprobably affiliated to robber bands, they said; suspected of lying in ambush at verge of copses at nightfall. The only thing in his favor was that he was a drunkard.
U||This is what people thought they had noticed:‚Äî
U||Of late, Boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone-breaking and care of the road at a very early hour, and to betaking himself to the forest with his pickaxe. He was encountered towards evening in the most deserted clearings, in the wildest thickets; and he had the appearance of being in search of something, and sometimes he was digging holes. The goodwives who passed took him at first for Beelzebub; then they recognized Boulatruelle, and were not in the least reassured thereby. These encounters seemed to cause Boulatruelle a lively displeasure. It was evident that he sought to hide, and that there was some mystery in what he was doing.
U||It was said in the village: ‚ÄúIt is clear that the devil has appeared. Boulatruelle has seen him, and is on the search. In sooth, he is cunning enough to pocket Lucifer‚Äôs hoard.‚Äù
U||The Voltairians added, ‚ÄúWill Boulatruelle catch the devil, or will the devil catch Boulatruelle?‚Äù The old women made a great many signs of the cross.
U||In the meantime, Boulatruelle‚Äôs man≈ìuvres in the forest ceased; and he resumed his regular occupation of roadmending; and people gossiped of something else.
U||Some persons, however, were still curious, surmising that in all this there was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends, but some fine windfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devil‚Äôs bank-bills, and that the road-mender had half discovered the secret. The most ‚Äúpuzzled‚Äù were the schoolmaster and Th√©nardier, the proprietor of the tavern, who was everybody‚Äôs friend, and had not disdained to ally himself with Boulatruelle.
U||‚ÄúHe has been in the galleys,‚Äù said Th√©nardier. ‚ÄúEh! Good God! no one knows who has been there or will be there.‚Äù
U||One evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law would have instituted an inquiry as to what Boulatruelle did in the forest, and that the latter would have been forced to speak, and that he would have been put to the torture in case of need, and that Boulatruelle would not have resisted the water test, for example. ‚ÄúLet us put him to the wine test,‚Äù said Th√©nardier.
U||They made an effort, and got the old road-mender to drinking. Boulatruelle drank an enormous amount, but said very little. He combined with admirable art, and in masterly proportions, the thirst of a gormandizer with the discretion of a judge. Nevertheless, by dint of returning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the few obscure words which he did allow to escape him, this is what Th√©nardier and the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out:‚Äî
U||One morning, when Boulatruelle was on his way to his work, at daybreak, he had been surprised to see, at a nook of the forest in the underbrush, a shovel and a pickaxe, concealed, as one might say.
U||However, he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and pick of Father Six-Fours, the water-carrier, and would have thought no more about it. But, on the evening of that day, he saw, without being seen himself, as he was hidden by a large tree, ‚Äúa person who did not belong in those parts, and whom he, Boulatruelle, knew well,‚Äù directing his steps towards the densest part of the wood. Translation by Th√©nardier: A comrade of the galleys. Boulatruelle obstinately refused to reveal his name. This person carried a package‚Äîsomething square, like a large box or a small trunk. Surprise on the part of Boulatruelle. However, it was only after the expiration of seven or eight minutes that the idea of following that ‚Äúperson‚Äù had occurred to him. But it was too late; the person was already in the thicket, night had descended, and Boulatruelle had not been able to catch up with him. Then he had adopted the course of watching for him at the edge of the woods. ‚ÄúIt was moonlight.‚Äù Two or three h
U||ours later, Boulatruelle had seen this person emerge from the brushwood, carrying no longer the coffer, but a shovel and pick. Boulatruelle had allowed the person to pass, and had not dreamed of accosting him, because he said to himself that the other man was three times as strong as he was, and armed with a pickaxe, and that he would probably knock him over the head on recognizing him, and on perceiving that he was recognized. Touching effusion of two old comrades on meeting again. But the shovel and pick had served as a ray of light to Boulatruelle; he had hastened to the thicket in the morning, and had found neither shovel nor pick. From this he had drawn the inference that this person, once in the forest, had dug a hole with his pick, buried the coffer, and reclosed the hole with his shovel. Now, the coffer was too small to contain a body; therefore it contained money. Hence his researches. Boulatruelle had explored, sounded, searched the entire forest and the thicket, and had dug wherever the earth appe
U||ared to him to have been recently turned up. In vain.
U||He had ‚Äúferreted out‚Äù nothing. No one in Montfermeil thought any more about it. There were only a few brave gossips, who said, ‚ÄúYou may be certain that the mender on the Gagny road did not take all that trouble for nothing; he was sure that the devil had come.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîTHE ANKLE-CHAIN MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CERTAIN PREPARATORY MANIPULATION TO BE THUS BROKEN WITH A BLOW FROM A HAMMER
U||Towards the end of October, in that same year, 1823, the inhabitants of Toulon beheld the entry into their port, after heavy weather, and for the purpose of repairing some damages, of the ship Orion, which was employed later at Brest as a school-ship, and which then formed a part of the Mediterranean squadron.
U||This vessel, battered as it was,‚Äîfor the sea had handled it roughly,‚Äîproduced a fine effect as it entered the roads. It flew some colors which procured for it the regulation salute of eleven guns, which it returned, shot for shot; total, twenty-two. It has been calculated that what with salvos, royal and military politenesses, courteous exchanges of uproar, signals of etiquette, formalities of roadsteads and citadels, sunrises and sunsets, saluted every day by all fortresses and all ships of war, openings and closings of ports, etc., the civilized world, discharged all over the earth, in the course of four and twenty hours, one hundred and fifty thousand useless shots. At six francs the shot, that comes to nine hundred thousand francs a day, three hundred millions a year, which vanish in smoke. This is a mere detail. All this time the poor were dying of hunger.
U||The year 1823 was what the Restoration called ‚Äúthe epoch of the Spanish war.‚Äù
U||This war contained many events in one, and a quantity of peculiarities. A grand family affair for the house of Bourbon; the branch of France succoring and protecting the branch of Madrid, that is to say, performing an act devolving on the elder; an apparent return to our national traditions, complicated by servitude and by subjection to the cabinets of the North; M. le Duc d‚ÄôAngoul√™me, surnamed by the liberal sheets the hero of Andujar, compressing in a triumphal attitude that was somewhat contradicted by his peaceable air, the ancient and very powerful terrorism of the Holy Office at variance with the chimerical terrorism of the liberals; the sansculottes resuscitated, to the great terror of dowagers, under the name of descamisados; monarchy opposing an obstacle to progress described as anarchy; the theories of ‚Äô89 roughly interrupted in the sap; a European halt, called to the French idea, which was making the tour of the world; beside the son of France as generalissimo, the Prince de Carignan, afterwa
U||rds Charles Albert, enrolling himself in that crusade of kings against people as a volunteer, with grenadier epaulets of red worsted; the soldiers of the Empire setting out on a fresh campaign, but aged, saddened, after eight years of repose, and under the white cockade; the tricolored standard waved abroad by a heroic handful of Frenchmen, as the white standard had been thirty years earlier at Coblentz; monks mingled with our troops; the spirit of liberty and of novelty brought to its senses by bayonets; principles slaughtered by cannonades; France undoing by her arms that which she had done by her mind; in addition to this, hostile leaders sold, soldiers hesitating, cities besieged by millions; no military perils, and yet possible explosions, as in every mine which is surprised and invaded; but little bloodshed, little honor won, shame for some, glory for no one. Such was this war, made by the princes descended from Louis XIV., and conducted by generals who had been under Napoleon. Its sad fate was to reca
U||ll neither the grand war nor grand politics.
U||Some feats of arms were serious; the taking of the Trocad√©ro, among others, was a fine military action; but after all, we repeat, the trumpets of this war give back a cracked sound, the whole effect was suspicious; history approves of France for making a difficulty about accepting this false triumph. It seemed evident that certain Spanish officers charged with resistance yielded too easily; the idea of corruption was connected with the victory; it appears as though generals and not battles had been won, and the conquering soldier returned humiliated. A debasing war, in short, in which the Bank of France could be read in the folds of the flag.
U||Soldiers of the war of 1808, on whom Saragossa had fallen in formidable ruin, frowned in 1823 at the easy surrender of citadels, and began to regret Palafox. It is the nature of France to prefer to have Rostopchine rather than Ballesteros in front of her.
U||From a still more serious point of view, and one which it is also proper to insist upon here, this war, which wounded the military spirit of France, enraged the democratic spirit. It was an enterprise of enthralment. In that campaign, the object of the French soldier, the son of democracy, was the conquest of a yoke for others. A hideous contradiction. France is made to arouse the soul of nations, not to stifle it. All the revolutions of Europe since 1792 are the French Revolution: liberty darts rays from France. That is a solar fact. Blind is he who will not see! It was Bonaparte who said it.
U||The war of 1823, an outrage on the generous Spanish nation, was then, at the same time, an outrage on the French Revolution. It was France who committed this monstrous violence; by foul means, for, with the exception of wars of liberation, everything that armies do is by foul means. The words passive obedience indicate this. An army is a strange masterpiece of combination where force results from an enormous sum of impotence. Thus is war, made by humanity against humanity, despite humanity, explained.
U||As for the Bourbons, the war of 1823 was fatal to them. They took it for a success. They did not perceive the danger that lies in having an idea slain to order. They went astray, in their innocence, to such a degree that they introduced the immense enfeeblement of a crime into their establishment as an element of strength. The spirit of the ambush entered into their politics. 1830 had its germ in 1823. The Spanish campaign became in their counsels an argument for force and for adventures by right Divine. France, having re-established el rey netto in Spain, might well have re-established the absolute king at home. They fell into the alarming error of taking the obedience of the soldier for the consent of the nation. Such confidence is the ruin of thrones. It is not permitted to fall asleep, either in the shadow of a machineel tree, nor in the shadow of an army.
U||Let us return to the ship Orion.
U||During the operations of the army commanded by the prince generalissimo, a squadron had been cruising in the Mediterranean. We have just stated that the Orion belonged to this fleet, and that accidents of the sea had brought it into port at Toulon.
U||The presence of a vessel of war in a port has something about it which attracts and engages a crowd. It is because it is great, and the crowd loves what is great.
U||A ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations of the genius of man with the powers of nature.
U||A ship of the line is composed, at the same time, of the heaviest and the lightest of possible matter, for it deals at one and the same time with three forms of substance,‚Äîsolid, liquid, and fluid,‚Äîand it must do battle with all three. It has eleven claws of iron with which to seize the granite on the bottom of the sea, and more wings and more antenn√¶ than winged insects, to catch the wind in the clouds. Its breath pours out through its hundred and twenty cannons as through enormous trumpets, and replies proudly to the thunder. The ocean seeks to lead it astray in the alarming sameness of its billows, but the vessel has its soul, its compass, which counsels it and always shows it the north. In the blackest nights, its lanterns supply the place of the stars. Thus, against the wind, it has its cordage and its canvas; against the water, wood; against the rocks, its iron, brass, and lead; against the shadows, its light; against immensity, a needle.
U||If one wishes to form an idea of all those gigantic proportions which, taken as a whole, constitute the ship of the line, one has only to enter one of the six-story covered construction stocks, in the ports of Brest or Toulon. The vessels in process of construction are under a bell-glass there, as it were. This colossal beam is a yard; that great column of wood which stretches out on the earth as far as the eye can reach is the main-mast. Taking it from its root in the stocks to its tip in the clouds, it is sixty fathoms long, and its diameter at its base is three feet. The English main-mast rises to a height of two hundred and seventeen feet above the water-line. The navy of our fathers employed cables, ours employs chains. The simple pile of chains on a ship of a hundred guns is four feet high, twenty feet in breadth, and eight feet in depth. And how much wood is required to make this ship? Three thousand cubic metres. It is a floating forest.
U||And moreover, let this be borne in mind, it is only a question here of the military vessel of forty years ago, of the simple sailing-vessel; steam, then in its infancy, has since added new miracles to that prodigy which is called a war vessel. At the present time, for example, the mixed vessel with a screw is a surprising machine, propelled by three thousand square metres of canvas and by an engine of two thousand five hundred horse-power.
U||Not to mention these new marvels, the ancient vessel of Christopher Columbus and of De Ruyter is one of the masterpieces of man. It is as inexhaustible in force as is the Infinite in gales; it stores up the wind in its sails, it is precise in the immense vagueness of the billows, it floats, and it reigns.
U||There comes an hour, nevertheless, when the gale breaks that sixty-foot yard like a straw, when the wind bends that mast four hundred feet tall, when that anchor, which weighs tens of thousands, is twisted in the jaws of the waves like a fisherman‚Äôs hook in the jaws of a pike, when those monstrous cannons utter plaintive and futile roars, which the hurricane bears forth into the void and into night, when all that power and all that majesty are engulfed in a power and majesty which are superior.
U||Every time that immense force is displayed to culminate in an immense feebleness it affords men food for thought. Hence in the ports curious people abound around these marvellous machines of war and of navigation, without being able to explain perfectly to themselves why. Every day, accordingly, from morning until night, the quays, sluices, and the jetties of the port of Toulon were covered with a multitude of idlers and loungers, as they say in Paris, whose business consisted in staring at the Orion.
U||The Orion was a ship that had been ailing for a long time; in the course of its previous cruises thick layers of barnacles had collected on its keel to such a degree as to deprive it of half its speed; it had gone into the dry dock the year before this, in order to have the barnacles scraped off, then it had put to sea again; but this cleaning had affected the bolts of the keel: in the neighborhood of the Balearic Isles the sides had been strained and had opened; and, as the plating in those days was not of sheet iron, the vessel had sprung a leak. A violent equinoctial gale had come up, which had first staved in a grating and a porthole on the larboard side, and damaged the foretop-gallant-shrouds; in consequence of these injuries, the Orion had run back to Toulon.
U||It anchored near the Arsenal; it was fully equipped, and repairs were begun. The hull had received no damage on the starboard, but some of the planks had been unnailed here and there, according to custom, to permit of air entering the hold.
U||One morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an accident.
U||The Ship Orion, an Accident
U||The crew was busy bending the sails; the topman, who had to take the upper corner of the main-top-sail on the starboard, lost his balance; he was seen to waver; the multitude thronging the Arsenal quay uttered a cry; the man‚Äôs head overbalanced his body; the man fell around the yard, with his hands outstretched towards the abyss; on his way he seized the footrope, first with one hand, then with the other, and remained hanging from it: the sea lay below him at a dizzy depth; the shock of his fall had imparted to the foot-rope a violent swinging motion; the man swayed back and forth at the end of that rope, like a stone in a sling.
U||It was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance; not one of the sailors, all fishermen of the coast, recently levied for the service, dared to attempt it. In the meantime, the unfortunate topman was losing his strength; his anguish could not be discerned on his face, but his exhaustion was visible in every limb; his arms were contracted in horrible twitchings; every effort which he made to re-ascend served but to augment the oscillations of the foot-rope; he did not shout, for fear of exhausting his strength. All were awaiting the minute when he should release his hold on the rope, and, from instant to instant, heads were turned aside that his fall might not be seen. There are moments when a bit of rope, a pole, the branch of a tree, is life itself, and it is a terrible thing to see a living being detach himself from it and fall like a ripe fruit.
U||All at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with the agility of a tiger-cat; this man was dressed in red; he was a convict; he wore a green cap; he was a life convict. On arriving on a level with the top, a gust of wind carried away his cap, and allowed a perfectly white head to be seen: he was not a young man.
U||A convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys had, in fact, at the very first instant, hastened to the officer of the watch, and, in the midst of the consternation and the hesitation of the crew, while all the sailors were trembling and drawing back, he had asked the officer‚Äôs permission to risk his life to save the topman; at an affirmative sign from the officer he had broken the chain riveted to his ankle with one blow of a hammer, then he had caught up a rope, and had dashed into the rigging: no one noticed, at the instant, with what ease that chain had been broken; it was only later on that the incident was recalled.
U||In a twinkling he was on the yard; he paused for a few seconds and appeared to be measuring it with his eye; these seconds, during which the breeze swayed the topman at the extremity of a thread, seemed centuries to those who were looking on. At last, the convict raised his eyes to heaven and advanced a step: the crowd drew a long breath. He was seen to run out along the yard: on arriving at the point, he fastened the rope which he had brought to it, and allowed the other end to hang down, then he began to descend the rope, hand over hand, and then,‚Äîand the anguish was indescribable,‚Äîinstead of one man suspended over the gulf, there were two.
U||One would have said it was a spider coming to seize a fly, only here the spider brought life, not death. Ten thousand glances were fastened on this group; not a cry, not a word; the same tremor contracted every brow; all mouths held their breath as though they feared to add the slightest puff to the wind which was swaying the two unfortunate men.
U||In the meantime, the convict had succeeded in lowering himself to a position near the sailor. It was high time; one minute more, and the exhausted and despairing man would have allowed himself to fall into the abyss. The convict had moored him securely with the cord to which he clung with one hand, while he was working with the other. At last, he was seen to climb back on the yard, and to drag the sailor up after him; he held him there a moment to allow him to recover his strength, then he grasped him in his arms and carried him, walking on the yard himself to the cap, and from there to the main-top, where he left him in the hands of his comrades.
U||At that moment the crowd broke into applause: old convict-sergeants among them wept, and women embraced each other on the quay, and all voices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rage, ‚ÄúPardon for that man!‚Äù
U||He, in the meantime, had immediately begun to make his descent to rejoin his detachment. In order to reach them the more speedily, he dropped into the rigging, and ran along one of the lower yards; all eyes were following him. At a certain moment fear assailed them; whether it was that he was fatigued, or that his head turned, they thought they saw him hesitate and stagger. All at once the crowd uttered a loud shout: the convict had fallen into the sea.
U||The fall was perilous. The frigate Alg√©siras was anchored alongside the Orion, and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels: it was to be feared that he would slip under one or the other of them. Four men flung themselves hastily into a boat; the crowd cheered them on; anxiety again took possession of all souls; the man had not risen to the surface; he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple, as though he had fallen into a cask of oil: they sounded, they dived. In vain. The search was continued until the evening: they did not even find the body.
U||On the following day the Toulon newspaper printed these lines:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúNov. 17, 1823. Yesterday, a convict belonging to the detachment on board of the Orion, on his return from rendering assistance to a sailor, fell into the sea and was drowned. The body has not yet been found; it is supposed that it is entangled among the piles of the Arsenal point: this man was committed under the number 9,430, and his name was Jean Valjean.‚Äù
U||BOOK THIRD‚ÄîACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE PROMISE MADE TO THE DEAD WOMAN
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîTHE WATER QUESTION AT MONTFERMEIL
U||Montfermeil is situated between Livry and Chelles, on the southern edge of that lofty table-land which separates the Ourcq from the Marne. At the present day it is a tolerably large town, ornamented all the year through with plaster villas, and on Sundays with beaming bourgeois. In 1823 there were at Montfermeil neither so many white houses nor so many well-satisfied citizens: it was only a village in the forest. Some pleasure-houses of the last century were to be met with there, to be sure, which were recognizable by their grand air, their balconies in twisted iron, and their long windows, whose tiny panes cast all sorts of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters; but Montfermeil was nonetheless a village. Retired cloth-merchants and rusticating attorneys had not discovered it as yet; it was a peaceful and charming place, which was not on the road to anywhere: there people lived, and cheaply, that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous and so easy; only, water was rare there, on accou
U||nt of the elevation of the plateau.
U||It was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance; the end of the village towards Gagny drew its water from the magnificent ponds which exist in the woods there. The other end, which surrounds the church and which lies in the direction of Chelles, found drinking-water only at a little spring half-way down the slope, near the road to Chelles, about a quarter of an hour from Montfermeil.
U||Thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water. The large houses, the aristocracy, of which the Th√©nardier tavern formed a part, paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a business of it, and who earned about eight sous a day in his enterprise of supplying Montfermeil with water; but this good man only worked until seven o‚Äôclock in the evening in summer, and five in winter; and night once come and the shutters on the ground floor once closed, he who had no water to drink went to fetch it for himself or did without it.
U||This constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader has probably not forgotten,‚Äîlittle Cosette. It will be remembered that Cosette was useful to the Th√©nardiers in two ways: they made the mother pay them, and they made the child serve them. So when the mother ceased to pay altogether, the reason for which we have read in preceding chapters, the Th√©nardiers kept Cosette. She took the place of a servant in their house. In this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when it was required. So the child, who was greatly terrified at the idea of going to the spring at night, took great care that water should never be lacking in the house.
U||Christmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil. The beginning of the winter had been mild; there had been neither snow nor frost up to that time. Some mountebanks from Paris had obtained permission of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street of the village, and a band of itinerant merchants, under protection of the same tolerance, had constructed their stalls on the Church Square, and even extended them into Boulanger Alley, where, as the reader will perhaps remember, the Th√©nardiers‚Äô hostelry was situated. These people filled the inns and drinking-shops, and communicated to that tranquil little district a noisy and joyous life. In order to play the part of a faithful historian, we ought even to add that, among the curiosities displayed in the square, there was a menagerie, in which frightful clowns, clad in rags and coming no one knew whence, exhibited to the peasants of Montfermeil in 1823 one of those horrible Brazilian vultures, such as our Royal Museum did not pos
U||sess until 1845, and which have a tricolored cockade for an eye. I believe that naturalists call this bird Caracara Polyborus; it belongs to the order of the Apicides, and to the family of the vultures. Some good old Bonapartist soldiers, who had retired to the village, went to see this creature with great devotion. The mountebanks gave out that the tricolored cockade was a unique phenomenon made by God expressly for their menagerie.
U||On Christmas eve itself, a number of men, carters, and peddlers, were seated at table, drinking and smoking around four or five candles in the public room of Th√©nardier‚Äôs hostelry. This room resembled all drinking-shop rooms,‚Äîtables, pewter jugs, bottles, drinkers, smokers; but little light and a great deal of noise. The date of the year 1823 was indicated, nevertheless, by two objects which were then fashionable in the bourgeois class: to wit, a kaleidoscope and a lamp of ribbed tin. The female Th√©nardier was attending to the supper, which was roasting in front of a clear fire; her husband was drinking with his customers and talking politics.
U||Besides political conversations which had for their principal subjects the Spanish war and M. le Duc d‚ÄôAngoul√™me, strictly local parentheses, like the following, were audible amid the uproar:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAbout Nanterre and Suresnes the vines have flourished greatly. When ten pieces were reckoned on there have been twelve. They have yielded a great deal of juice under the press.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut the grapes cannot be ripe?‚Äù ‚ÄúIn those parts the grapes should not be ripe; the wine turns oily as soon as spring comes.‚Äù ‚ÄúThen it is very thin wine?‚Äù ‚ÄúThere are wines poorer even than these. The grapes must be gathered while green.‚Äù Etc.
U||Or a miller would call out:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAre we responsible for what is in the sacks? We find in them a quantity of small seed which we cannot sift out, and which we are obliged to send through the mill-stones; there are tares, fennel, vetches, hempseed, fox-tail, and a host of other weeds, not to mention pebbles, which abound in certain wheat, especially in Breton wheat. I am not fond of grinding Breton wheat, any more than long-sawyers like to saw beams with nails in them. You can judge of the bad dust that makes in grinding. And then people complain of the flour. They are in the wrong. The flour is no fault of ours.‚Äù
U||In a space between two windows a mower, who was seated at table with a landed proprietor who was fixing on a price for some meadow work to be performed in the spring, was saying:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt does no harm to have the grass wet. It cuts better. Dew is a good thing, sir. It makes no difference with that grass. Your grass is young and very hard to cut still. It‚Äôs terribly tender. It yields before the iron.‚Äù Etc.
U||Cosette was in her usual place, seated on the cross-bar of the kitchen table near the chimney. She was in rags; her bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes, and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollen stockings destined for the young Th√©nardiers. A very young kitten was playing about among the chairs. Laughter and chatter were audible in the adjoining room, from two fresh children‚Äôs voices: it was √âponine and Azelma.
U||In the chimney-corner a cat-o‚Äô-nine-tails was hanging on a nail.
U||At intervals the cry of a very young child, which was somewhere in the house, rang through the noise of the dram-shop. It was a little boy who had been born to the Th√©nardiers during one of the preceding winters,‚Äî‚Äúshe did not know why,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthe result of the cold,‚Äù‚Äîand who was a little more than three years old. The mother had nursed him, but she did not love him. When the persistent clamor of the brat became too annoying, ‚ÄúYour son is squalling,‚Äù Th√©nardier would say; ‚Äúdo go and see what he wants.‚Äù ‚ÄúBah!‚Äù the mother would reply, ‚Äúhe bothers me.‚Äù And the neglected child continued to shriek in the dark.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîTWO COMPLETE PORTRAITS
U||So far in this book the Th√©nardiers have been viewed only in profile; the moment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple, and considering it under all its aspects.
U||Th√©nardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday; Madame Th√©nardier was approaching her forties, which is equivalent to fifty in a woman; so that there existed a balance of age between husband and wife.
U||Our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this Th√©nardier woman, ever since her first appearance,‚Äîtall, blond, red, fat, angular, square, enormous, and agile; she belonged, as we have said, to the race of those colossal wild women, who contort themselves at fairs with paving-stones hanging from their hair. She did everything about the house,‚Äîmade the beds, did the washing, the cooking, and everything else. Cosette was her only servant; a mouse in the service of an elephant. Everything trembled at the sound of her voice,‚Äîwindow panes, furniture, and people. Her big face, dotted with red blotches, presented the appearance of a skimmer. She had a beard. She was an ideal market-porter dressed in woman‚Äôs clothes. She swore splendidly; she boasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist. Except for the romances which she had read, and which made the affected lady peep through the ogress at times, in a very queer way, the idea would never have occurred to any one to say of her
U||, ‚ÄúThat is a woman.‚Äù This Th√©nardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted on a fishwife. When one heard her speak, one said, ‚ÄúThat is a gendarme‚Äù; when one saw her drink, one said, ‚ÄúThat is a carter‚Äù; when one saw her handle Cosette, one said, ‚ÄúThat is the hangman.‚Äù One of her teeth projected when her face was in repose.
U||Th√©nardier was a small, thin, pale, angular, bony, feeble man, who had a sickly air and who was wonderfully healthy. His cunning began here; he smiled habitually, by way of precaution, and was almost polite to everybody, even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing. He had the glance of a pole-cat and the bearing of a man of letters. He greatly resembled the portraits of the Abb√© Delille. His coquetry consisted in drinking with the carters. No one had ever succeeded in rendering him drunk. He smoked a big pipe. He wore a blouse, and under his blouse an old black coat. He made pretensions to literature and to materialism. There were certain names which he often pronounced to support whatever things he might be saying,‚ÄîVoltaire, Raynal, Parny, and, singularly enough, Saint Augustine. He declared that he had ‚Äúa system.‚Äù In addition, he was a great swindler. A filousophe [philosophe], a scientific thief. The species does exist. It will be remembered that he pretended to have served in the army; 
U||he was in the habit of relating with exuberance, how, being a sergeant in the 6th or the 9th light something or other, at Waterloo, he had alone, and in the presence of a squadron of death-dealing hussars, covered with his body and saved from death, in the midst of the grape-shot, ‚Äúa general, who had been dangerously wounded.‚Äù Thence arose for his wall the flaring sign, and for his inn the name which it bore in the neighborhood, of ‚Äúthe cabaret of the Sergeant of Waterloo.‚Äù He was a liberal, a classic, and a Bonapartist. He had subscribed for the Champ d‚ÄôAsile. It was said in the village that he had studied for the priesthood.
U||We believe that he had simply studied in Holland for an inn-keeper. This rascal of composite order was, in all probability, some Fleming from Lille, in Flanders, a Frenchman in Paris, a Belgian at Brussels, being comfortably astride of both frontiers. As for his prowess at Waterloo, the reader is already acquainted with that. It will be perceived that he exaggerated it a trifle. Ebb and flow, wandering, adventure, was the leven of his existence; a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary life, and, apparently at the stormy epoch of June 18, 1815, Th√©nardier belonged to that variety of marauding sutlers of which we have spoken, beating about the country, selling to some, stealing from others, and travelling like a family man, with wife and children, in a rickety cart, in the rear of troops on the march, with an instinct for always attaching himself to the victorious army. This campaign ended, and having, as he said, ‚Äúsome quibus,‚Äù he had come to Montfermeil and set up an inn there.
U||This quibus, composed of purses and watches, of gold rings and silver crosses, gathered in harvest-time in furrows sown with corpses, did not amount to a large total, and did not carry this sutler turned eating-house-keeper very far.
U||Th√©nardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his gestures which, accompanied by an oath, recalls the barracks, and by a sign of the cross, the seminary. He was a fine talker. He allowed it to be thought that he was an educated man. Nevertheless, the schoolmaster had noticed that he pronounced improperly.12
U||He composed the travellers‚Äô tariff card in a superior manner, but practised eyes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in it. Th√©nardier was cunning, greedy, slothful, and clever. He did not disdain his servants, which caused his wife to dispense with them. This giantess was jealous. It seemed to her that that thin and yellow little man must be an object coveted by all.
U||Th√©nardier, who was, above all, an astute and well-balanced man, was a scamp of a temperate sort. This is the worst species; hypocrisy enters into it.
U||It is not that Th√©nardier was not, on occasion, capable of wrath to quite the same degree as his wife; but this was very rare, and at such times, since he was enraged with the human race in general, as he bore within him a deep furnace of hatred. And since he was one of those people who are continually avenging their wrongs, who accuse everything that passes before them of everything which has befallen them, and who are always ready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand, as a legitimate grievance, the sum total of the deceptions, the bankruptcies, and the calamities of their lives,‚Äîwhen all this leaven was stirred up in him and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes, he was terrible. Woe to the person who came under his wrath at such a time!
U||In addition to his other qualities, Th√©nardier was attentive and penetrating, silent or talkative, according to circumstances, and always highly intelligent. He had something of the look of sailors, who are accustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses. Th√©nardier was a statesman.
U||Every newcomer who entered the tavern said, on catching sight of Madame Th√©nardier, ‚ÄúThere is the master of the house.‚Äù A mistake. She was not even the mistress. The husband was both master and mistress. She worked; he created. He directed everything by a sort of invisible and constant magnetic action. A word was sufficient for him, sometimes a sign; the mastodon obeyed. Th√©nardier was a sort of special and sovereign being in Madame Th√©nardier‚Äôs eyes, though she did not thoroughly realize it. She was possessed of virtues after her own kind; if she had ever had a disagreement as to any detail with ‚ÄúMonsieur Th√©nardier,‚Äù‚Äîwhich was an inadmissible hypothesis, by the way,‚Äîshe would not have blamed her husband in public on any subject whatever. She would never have committed ‚Äúbefore strangers‚Äù that mistake so often committed by women, and which is called in parliamentary language, ‚Äúexposing the crown.‚Äù Although their concord had only evil as its result, there was contemplation in Madame 
U||Th√©nardier‚Äôs submission to her husband. That mountain of noise and of flesh moved under the little finger of that frail despot. Viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side, this was that grand and universal thing, the adoration of mind by matter; for certain ugly features have a cause in the very depths of eternal beauty. There was an unknown quantity about Th√©nardier; hence the absolute empire of the man over that woman. At certain moments she beheld him like a lighted candle; at others she felt him like a claw.
U||This woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except her children, and who did not fear any one except her husband. She was a mother because she was mammiferous. But her maternity stopped short with her daughters, and, as we shall see, did not extend to boys. The man had but one thought,‚Äîhow to enrich himself.
U||He did not succeed in this. A theatre worthy of this great talent was lacking. Th√©nardier was ruining himself at Montfermeil, if ruin is possible to zero; in Switzerland or in the Pyrenees this penniless scamp would have become a millionaire; but an inn-keeper must browse where fate has hitched him.
U||It will be understood that the word inn-keeper is here employed in a restricted sense, and does not extend to an entire class.
U||In this same year, 1823, Th√©nardier was burdened with about fifteen hundred francs‚Äô worth of petty debts, and this rendered him anxious.
U||Whatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in this case, Th√©nardier was one of those men who understand best, with the most profundity and in the most modern fashion, that thing which is a virtue among barbarous peoples and an object of merchandise among civilized peoples,‚Äîhospitality. Besides, he was an admirable poacher, and quoted for his skill in shooting. He had a certain cold and tranquil laugh, which was particularly dangerous.
U||His theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes. He had professional aphorisms, which he inserted into his wife‚Äôs mind. ‚ÄúThe duty of the inn-keeper,‚Äù he said to her one day, violently, and in a low voice, ‚Äúis to sell to the first comer, stews, repose, light, fire, dirty sheets, a servant, lice, and a smile; to stop passers-by, to empty small purses, and to honestly lighten heavy ones; to shelter travelling families respectfully: to shave the man, to pluck the woman, to pick the child clean; to quote the window open, the window shut, the chimney-corner, the armchair, the chair, the ottoman, the stool, the feather-bed, the mattress and the truss of straw; to know how much the shadow uses up the mirror, and to put a price on it; and, by five hundred thousand devils, to make the traveller pay for everything, even for the flies which his dog eats!‚Äù
U||This man and this woman were ruse and rage wedded‚Äîa hideous and terrible team.
U||While the husband pondered and combined, Madame Th√©nardier thought not of absent creditors, took no heed of yesterday nor of to-morrow, and lived in a fit of anger, all in a minute.
U||Such were these two beings. Cosette was between them, subjected to their double pressure, like a creature who is at the same time being ground up in a mill and pulled to pieces with pincers. The man and the woman each had a different method: Cosette was overwhelmed with blows‚Äîthis was the woman‚Äôs; she went barefooted in winter‚Äîthat was the man‚Äôs doing.
U||Cosette ran upstairs and down, washed, swept, rubbed, dusted, ran, fluttered about, panted, moved heavy articles, and weak as she was, did the coarse work. There was no mercy for her; a fierce mistress and venomous master. The Th√©nardier hostelry was like a spider‚Äôs web, in which Cosette had been caught, and where she lay trembling. The ideal of oppression was realized by this sinister household. It was something like the fly serving the spiders.
U||The poor child passively held her peace.
U||What takes place within these souls when they have but just quitted God, find themselves thus, at the very dawn of life, very small and in the midst of men all naked!
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîMEN MUST HAVE WINE, AND HORSES MUST HAVE WATER
U||Four new travellers had arrived.
U||Cosette was meditating sadly; for, although she was only eight years old, she had already suffered so much that she reflected with the lugubrious air of an old woman. Her eye was black in consequence of a blow from Madame Th√©nardier‚Äôs fist, which caused the latter to remark from time to time, ‚ÄúHow ugly she is with her fist-blow on her eye!‚Äù
U||Cosette was thinking that it was dark, very dark, that the pitchers and caraffes in the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must have been filled and that there was no more water in the cistern.
U||She was somewhat reassured because no one in the Th√©nardier establishment drank much water. Thirsty people were never lacking there; but their thirst was of the sort which applies to the jug rather than to the pitcher. Any one who had asked for a glass of water among all those glasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these men. But there came a moment when the child trembled; Madame Th√©nardier raised the cover of a stew-pan which was boiling on the stove, then seized a glass and briskly approached the cistern. She turned the faucet; the child had raised her head and was following all the woman‚Äôs movements. A thin stream of water trickled from the faucet, and half filled the glass. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúthere is no more water!‚Äù A momentary silence ensued. The child did not breathe.
U||‚ÄúBah!‚Äù resumed Madame Th√©nardier, examining the half-filled glass, ‚Äúthis will be enough.‚Äù
U||Cosette applied herself to her work once more, but for a quarter of an hour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big snow-flake.
U||She counted the minutes that passed in this manner, and wished it were the next morning.
U||From time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street, and exclaimed, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as black as an oven!‚Äù or, ‚ÄúOne must needs be a cat to go about the streets without a lantern at this hour!‚Äù And Cosette trembled.
U||All at once one of the pedlers who lodged in the hostelry entered, and said in a harsh voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMy horse has not been watered.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, it has,‚Äù said Madame Th√©nardier.
U||‚ÄúI tell you that it has not,‚Äù retorted the pedler.
U||Cosette had emerged from under the table.
U||‚ÄúOh, yes, sir!‚Äù said she, ‚Äúthe horse has had a drink; he drank out of a bucket, a whole bucketful, and it was I who took the water to him, and I spoke to him.‚Äù
U||It was not true; Cosette lied.
U||‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big as the house,‚Äù exclaimed the pedler. ‚ÄúI tell you that he has not been watered, you little jade! He has a way of blowing when he has had no water, which I know well.‚Äù
U||Cosette persisted, and added in a voice rendered hoarse with anguish, and which was hardly audible:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd he drank heartily.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCome,‚Äù said the pedler, in a rage, ‚Äúthis won‚Äôt do at all, let my horse be watered, and let that be the end of it!‚Äù
U||Cosette crept under the table again.
U||‚ÄúIn truth, that is fair!‚Äù said Madame Th√©nardier, ‚Äúif the beast has not been watered, it must be.‚Äù
U||Then glancing about her:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWell, now! Where‚Äôs that other beast?‚Äù
U||She bent down and discovered Cosette cowering at the other end of the table, almost under the drinkers‚Äô feet.
U||‚ÄúAre you coming?‚Äù shrieked Madame Th√©nardier.
U||Cosette crawled out of the sort of hole in which she had hidden herself. The Th√©nardier resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMademoiselle Dog-lack-name, go and water that horse.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut, Madame,‚Äù said Cosette, feebly, ‚Äúthere is no water.‚Äù
U||The Th√©nardier threw the street door wide open:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWell, go and get some, then!‚Äù
U||Cosette dropped her head, and went for an empty bucket which stood near the chimney-corner.
U||This bucket was bigger than she was, and the child could have set down in it at her ease.
U||The Th√©nardier returned to her stove, and tasted what was in the stewpan, with a wooden spoon, grumbling the while:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThere‚Äôs plenty in the spring. There never was such a malicious creature as that. I think I should have done better to strain my onions.‚Äù
U||Then she rummaged in a drawer which contained sous, pepper, and shallots.
U||‚ÄúSee here, Mam‚Äôselle Toad,‚Äù she added, ‚Äúon your way back, you will get a big loaf from the baker. Here‚Äôs a fifteen-sou piece.‚Äù
U||Cosette had a little pocket on one side of her apron; she took the coin without saying a word, and put it in that pocket.
U||Then she stood motionless, bucket in hand, the open door before her. She seemed to be waiting for some one to come to her rescue.
U||‚ÄúGet along with you!‚Äù screamed the Th√©nardier.
U||Cosette went out. The door closed behind her.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîENTRANCE ON THE SCENE OF A DOLL
U||The line of open-air booths starting at the church, extended, as the reader will remember, as far as the hostelry of the Th√©nardiers. These booths were all illuminated, because the citizens would soon pass on their way to the midnight mass, with candles burning in paper funnels, which, as the schoolmaster, then seated at the table at the Th√©nardiers‚Äô observed, produced ‚Äúa magical effect.‚Äù In compensation, not a star was visible in the sky.
U||The last of these stalls, established precisely opposite the Th√©nardiers‚Äô door, was a toy-shop all glittering with tinsel, glass, and magnificent objects of tin. In the first row, and far forwards, the merchant had placed on a background of white napkins, an immense doll, nearly two feet high, who was dressed in a robe of pink crepe, with gold wheat-ears on her head, which had real hair and enamel eyes. All that day, this marvel had been displayed to the wonderment of all passers-by under ten years of age, without a mother being found in Montfermeil sufficiently rich or sufficiently extravagant to give it to her child. √âponine and Azelma had passed hours in contemplating it, and Cosette herself had ventured to cast a glance at it, on the sly, it is true.
U||At the moment when Cosette emerged, bucket in hand, melancholy and overcome as she was, she could not refrain from lifting her eyes to that wonderful doll, towards the lady, as she called it. The poor child paused in amazement. She had not yet beheld that doll close to. The whole shop seemed a palace to her: the doll was not a doll; it was a vision. It was joy, splendor, riches, happiness, which appeared in a sort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly engulfed in gloomy and chilly misery. With the sad and innocent sagacity of childhood, Cosette measured the abyss which separated her from that doll. She said to herself that one must be a queen, or at least a princess, to have a ‚Äúthing‚Äù like that. She gazed at that beautiful pink dress, that beautiful smooth hair, and she thought, ‚ÄúHow happy that doll must be!‚Äù She could not take her eyes from that fantastic stall. The more she looked, the more dazzled she grew. She thought she was gazing at paradise. There were other dolls behi
U||nd the large one, which seemed to her to be fairies and genii. The merchant, who was pacing back and forth in front of his shop, produced on her somewhat the effect of being the Eternal Father.
U||In this adoration she forgot everything, even the errand with which she was charged.
U||All at once the Th√©nardier‚Äôs coarse voice recalled her to reality: ‚ÄúWhat, you silly jade! you have not gone? Wait! I‚Äôll give it to you! I want to know what you are doing there! Get along, you little monster!‚Äù
U||The Th√©nardier had cast a glance into the street, and had caught sight of Cosette in her ecstasy.
U||Cosette fled, dragging her pail, and taking the longest strides of which she was capable.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîTHE LITTLE ONE ALL ALONE
U||As the Th√©nardier hostelry was in that part of the village which is near the church, it was to the spring in the forest in the direction of Chelles that Cosette was obliged to go for her water.
U||She did not glance at the display of a single other merchant. So long as she was in Boulanger Lane and in the neighborhood of the church, the lighted stalls illuminated the road; but soon the last light from the last stall vanished. The poor child found herself in the dark. She plunged into it. Only, as a certain emotion overcame her, she made as much motion as possible with the handle of the bucket as she walked along. This made a noise which afforded her company.
U||The further she went, the denser the darkness became. There was no one in the streets. However, she did encounter a woman, who turned around on seeing her, and stood still, muttering between her teeth: ‚ÄúWhere can that child be going? Is it a werewolf child?‚Äù Then the woman recognized Cosette. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúit‚Äôs the Lark!‚Äù
U||In this manner Cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted streets which terminate in the village of Montfermeil on the side of Chelles. So long as she had the houses or even the walls only on both sides of her path, she proceeded with tolerable boldness. From time to time she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of a shutter‚Äîthis was light and life; there were people there, and it reassured her. But in proportion as she advanced, her pace slackened mechanically, as it were. When she had passed the corner of the last house, Cosette paused. It had been hard to advance further than the last stall; it became impossible to proceed further than the last house. She set her bucket on the ground, thrust her hand into her hair, and began slowly to scratch her head,‚Äîa gesture peculiar to children when terrified and undecided what to do. It was no longer Montfermeil; it was the open fields. Black and desert space was before her. She gazed in despair at that darkness, where there was no long
U||er any one, where there were beasts, where there were spectres, possibly. She took a good look, and heard the beasts walking on the grass, and she distinctly saw spectres moving in the trees. Then she seized her bucket again; fear had lent her audacity. ‚ÄúBah!‚Äù said she; ‚ÄúI will tell him that there was no more water!‚Äù And she resolutely re-entered Montfermeil.
U||Hardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused and began to scratch her head again. Now it was the Th√©nardier who appeared to her, with her hideous, hyena mouth, and wrath flashing in her eyes. The child cast a melancholy glance before her and behind her. What was she to do? What was to become of her? Where was she to go? In front of her was the spectre of the Th√©nardier; behind her all the phantoms of the night and of the forest. It was before the Th√©nardier that she recoiled. She resumed her path to the spring, and began to run. She emerged from the village, she entered the forest at a run, no longer looking at or listening to anything. She only paused in her course when her breath failed her; but she did not halt in her advance. She went straight before her in desperation.
U||As she ran she felt like crying.
U||The nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely.
U||She no longer thought, she no longer saw. The immensity of night was facing this tiny creature. On the one hand, all shadow; on the other, an atom.
U||It was only seven or eight minutes‚Äô walk from the edge of the woods to the spring. Cosette knew the way, through having gone over it many times in daylight. Strange to say, she did not get lost. A remnant of instinct guided her vaguely. But she did not turn her eyes either to right or to left, for fear of seeing things in the branches and in the brushwood. In this manner she reached the spring.
U||It was a narrow, natural basin, hollowed out by the water in a clayey soil, about two feet deep, surrounded with moss and with those tall, crimped grasses which are called Henry IV.‚Äôs frills, and paved with several large stones. A brook ran out of it, with a tranquil little noise.
U||Cosette did not take time to breathe. It was very dark, but she was in the habit of coming to this spring. She felt with her left hand in the dark for a young oak which leaned over the spring, and which usually served to support her, found one of its branches, clung to it, bent down, and plunged the bucket in the water. She was in a state of such violent excitement that her strength was trebled. While thus bent over, she did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself into the spring. The fifteen-sou piece fell into the water. Cosette neither saw nor heard it fall. She drew out the bucket nearly full, and set it on the grass.
U||That done, she perceived that she was worn out with fatigue. She would have liked to set out again at once, but the effort required to fill the bucket had been such that she found it impossible to take a step. She was forced to sit down. She dropped on the grass, and remained crouching there.
U||She shut her eyes; then she opened them again, without knowing why, but because she could not do otherwise. The agitated water in the bucket beside her was describing circles which resembled tin serpents.
U||Overhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds, which were like masses of smoke. The tragic mask of shadow seemed to bend vaguely over the child.
U||Jupiter was setting in the depths.
U||The child stared with bewildered eyes at this great star, with which she was unfamiliar, and which terrified her. The planet was, in fact, very near the horizon and was traversing a dense layer of mist which imparted to it a horrible ruddy hue. The mist, gloomily empurpled, magnified the star. One would have called it a luminous wound.
U||A cold wind was blowing from the plain. The forest was dark, not a leaf was moving; there were none of the vague, fresh gleams of summertide. Great boughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise. Slender and misshapen bushes whistled in the clearings. The tall grasses undulated like eels under the north wind. The nettles seemed to twist long arms furnished with claws in search of prey. Some bits of dry heather, tossed by the breeze, flew rapidly by, and had the air of fleeing in terror before something which was coming after. On all sides there were lugubrious stretches.
U||The darkness was bewildering. Man requires light. Whoever buries himself in the opposite of day feels his heart contract. When the eye sees black, the heart sees trouble. In an eclipse in the night, in the sooty opacity, there is anxiety even for the stoutest of hearts. No one walks alone in the forest at night without trembling. Shadows and trees‚Äîtwo formidable densities. A chimerical reality appears in the indistinct depths. The inconceivable is outlined a few paces distant from you with a spectral clearness. One beholds floating, either in space or in one‚Äôs own brain, one knows not what vague and intangible thing, like the dreams of sleeping flowers. There are fierce attitudes on the horizon. One inhales the effluvia of the great black void. One is afraid to glance behind him, yet desirous of doing so. The cavities of night, things grown haggard, taciturn profiles which vanish when one advances, obscure dishevelments, irritated tufts, livid pools, the lugubrious reflected in the funereal, the sepulchr
U||al immensity of silence, unknown but possible beings, bendings of mysterious branches, alarming torsos of trees, long handfuls of quivering plants,‚Äîagainst all this one has no protection. There is no hardihood which does not shudder and which does not feel the vicinity of anguish. One is conscious of something hideous, as though one‚Äôs soul were becoming amalgamated with the darkness. This penetration of the shadows is indescribably sinister in the case of a child.
U||Forests are apocalypses, and the beating of the wings of a tiny soul produces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault.
U||Without understanding her sensations, Cosette was conscious that she was seized upon by that black enormity of nature; it was no longer terror alone which was gaining possession of her; it was something more terrible even than terror; she shivered. There are no words to express the strangeness of that shiver which chilled her to the very bottom of her heart; her eye grew wild; she thought she felt that she should not be able to refrain from returning there at the same hour on the morrow.
U||Then, by a sort of instinct, she began to count aloud, one, two, three, four, and so on up to ten, in order to escape from that singular state which she did not understand, but which terrified her, and, when she had finished, she began again; this restored her to a true perception of the things about her. Her hands, which she had wet in drawing the water, felt cold; she rose; her terror, a natural and unconquerable terror, had returned: she had but one thought now,‚Äîto flee at full speed through the forest, across the fields to the houses, to the windows, to the lighted candles. Her glance fell upon the water which stood before her; such was the fright which the Th√©nardier inspired in her, that she dared not flee without that bucket of water: she seized the handle with both hands; she could hardly lift the pail.
U||In this manner she advanced a dozen paces, but the bucket was full; it was heavy; she was forced to set it on the ground once more. She took breath for an instant, then lifted the handle of the bucket again, and resumed her march, proceeding a little further this time, but again she was obliged to pause. After some seconds of repose she set out again. She walked bent forward, with drooping head, like an old woman; the weight of the bucket strained and stiffened her thin arms. The iron handle completed the benumbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands; she was forced to halt from time to time, and each time that she did so, the cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs. This took place in the depths of a forest, at night, in winter, far from all human sight; she was a child of eight: no one but God saw that sad thing at the moment.
U||And her mother, no doubt, alas!
U||For there are things that make the dead open their eyes in their graves.
U||She panted with a sort of painful rattle; sobs contracted her throat, but she dared not weep, so afraid was she of the Th√©nardier, even at a distance: it was her custom to imagine the Th√©nardier always present.
U||However, she could not make much headway in that manner, and she went on very slowly. In spite of diminishing the length of her stops, and of walking as long as possible between them, she reflected with anguish that it would take her more than an hour to return to Montfermeil in this manner, and that the Th√©nardier would beat her. This anguish was mingled with her terror at being alone in the woods at night; she was worn out with fatigue, and had not yet emerged from the forest. On arriving near an old chestnut-tree with which she was acquainted, made a last halt, longer than the rest, in order that she might get well rested; then she summoned up all her strength, picked up her bucket again, and courageously resumed her march, but the poor little desperate creature could not refrain from crying, ‚ÄúO my God! my God!‚Äù
U||At that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longer weighed anything at all: a hand, which seemed to her enormous, had just seized the handle, and lifted it vigorously. She raised her head. A large black form, straight and erect, was walking beside her through the darkness; it was a man who had come up behind her, and whose approach she had not heard. This man, without uttering a word, had seized the handle of the bucket which she was carrying.
U||There are instincts for all the encounters of life.
U||The child was not afraid.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîWHICH POSSIBLY PROVES BOULATRUELLE‚ÄôS INTELLIGENCE
U||On the afternoon of that same Christmas Day, 1823, a man had walked for rather a long time in the most deserted part of the Boulevard de l‚ÄôH√¥pital in Paris. This man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings, and he seemed to halt, by preference, at the most modest houses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg Saint-Marceau.
U||We shall see further on that this man had, in fact, hired a chamber in that isolated quarter.
U||This man, in his attire, as in all his person, realized the type of what may be called the well-bred mendicant,‚Äîextreme wretchedness combined with extreme cleanliness. This is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man who is very poor, and for the man who is very worthy. He wore a very old and very well brushed round hat; a coarse coat, worn perfectly threadbare, of an ochre yellow, a color that was not in the least eccentric at that epoch; a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable cut; black breeches, worn gray at the knee, stockings of black worsted; and thick shoes with copper buckles. He would have been pronounced a preceptor in some good family, returned from the emigration. He would have been taken for more than sixty years of age, from his perfectly white hair, his wrinkled brow, his livid lips, and his countenance, where everything breathed depression and weariness of life. Judging from his firm tread, from the singular vigor whic
U||h stamped all his movements, he would have hardly been thought fifty. The wrinkles on his brow were well placed, and would have disposed in his favor any one who observed him attentively. His lip contracted with a strange fold which seemed severe, and which was humble. There was in the depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity. In his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief; in his right he leaned on a sort of a cudgel, cut from some hedge. This stick had been carefully trimmed, and had an air that was not too threatening; the most had been made of its knots, and it had received a coral-like head, made from red wax: it was a cudgel, and it seemed to be a cane.
U||There are but few passers-by on that boulevard, particularly in the winter. The man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them, but this without any affectation.
U||At that epoch, King Louis XVIII. went nearly every day to Choisy-le-Roi: it was one of his favorite excursions. Towards two o‚Äôclock, almost invariably, the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen to pass at full speed along the Boulevard de l‚ÄôH√¥pital.
U||This served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the quarter who said, ‚ÄúIt is two o‚Äôclock; there he is returning to the Tuileries.‚Äù
U||And some rushed forward, and others drew up in line, for a passing king always creates a tumult; besides, the appearance and disappearance of Louis XVIII. produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris. It was rapid but majestic. This impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop; as he was not able to walk, he wished to run: that cripple would gladly have had himself drawn by the lightning. He passed, pacific and severe, in the midst of naked swords. His massive couch, all covered with gilding, with great branches of lilies painted on the panels, thundered noisily along. There was hardly time to cast a glance upon it. In the rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white satin a large, firm, and ruddy face, a brow freshly powdered √† l‚Äôoiseau royal, a proud, hard, crafty eye, the smile of an educated man, two great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat, the Golden Fleece, the cross of Saint Louis, the cross of the Legion of Honor, the silver plaque of the Sain
U||t-Esprit, a huge belly, and a wide blue ribbon: it was the king. Outside of Paris, he held his hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high English gaiters; when he re-entered the city, he put on his hat and saluted rarely; he stared coldly at the people, and they returned it in kind. When he appeared for the first time in the Saint-Marceau quarter, the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade, ‚ÄúThat big fellow yonder is the government.‚Äù
U||This infallible passage of the king at the same hour was, therefore, the daily event of the Boulevard de l‚ÄôH√¥pital.
U||The promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the quarter, and probably did not belong in Paris, for he was ignorant as to this detail. When, at two o‚Äôclock, the royal carriage, surrounded by a squadron of the body-guard all covered with silver lace, debouched on the boulevard, after having made the turn of the Salp√™tri√®re, he appeared surprised and almost alarmed. There was no one but himself in this cross-lane. He drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an enclosure, though this did not prevent M. le Duc de Havr√© from spying him out.
U||M. le Duc de Havr√©, as captain of the guard on duty that day, was seated in the carriage, opposite the king. He said to his Majesty, ‚ÄúYonder is an evil-looking man.‚Äù Members of the police, who were clearing the king‚Äôs route, took equal note of him: one of them received an order to follow him. But the man plunged into the deserted little streets of the faubourg, and as twilight was beginning to fall, the agent lost trace of him, as is stated in a report addressed that same evening to M. le Comte d‚ÄôAngl√®s, Minister of State, Prefect of Police.
U||When the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track, he redoubled his pace, not without turning round many a time to assure himself that he was not being followed. At a quarter-past four, that is to say, when night was fully come, he passed in front of the theatre of the Porte Saint-Martin, where The Two Convicts was being played that day. This poster, illuminated by the theatre lanterns, struck him; for, although he was walking rapidly, he halted to read it. An instant later he was in the blind alley of La Planchette, and he entered the Plat d‚ÄôEtain [the Pewter Platter], where the office of the coach for Lagny was then situated. This coach set out at half-past four. The horses were harnessed, and the travellers, summoned by the coachman, were hastily climbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle.
U||The man inquired:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHave you a place?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOnly one‚Äîbeside me on the box,‚Äù said the coachman.
U||‚ÄúI will take it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúClimb up.‚Äù
U||Nevertheless, before setting out, the coachman cast a glance at the traveller‚Äôs shabby dress, at the diminutive size of his bundle, and made him pay his fare.
U||‚ÄúAre you going as far as Lagny?‚Äù demanded the coachman.
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the man.
U||The traveller paid to Lagny.
U||They started. When they had passed the barrier, the coachman tried to enter into conversation, but the traveller only replied in monosyllables. The coachman took to whistling and swearing at his horses.
U||The coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak. It was cold. The man did not appear to be thinking of that. Thus they passed Gournay and Neuilly-sur-Marne.
U||Towards six o‚Äôclock in the evening they reached Chelles. The coachman drew up in front of the carters‚Äô inn installed in the ancient buildings of the Royal Abbey, to give his horses a breathing spell.
U||‚ÄúI get down here,‚Äù said the man.
U||He took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle.
U||An instant later he had disappeared.
U||He did not enter the inn.
U||When the coach set out for Lagny a few minutes later, it did not encounter him in the principal street of Chelles.
U||The coachman turned to the inside travellers.
U||‚ÄúThere,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúis a man who does not belong here, for I do not know him. He had not the air of owning a sou, but he does not consider money; he pays to Lagny, and he goes only as far as Chelles. It is night; all the houses are shut; he does not enter the inn, and he is not to be found. So he has dived through the earth.‚Äù
U||The man had not plunged into the earth, but he had gone with great strides through the dark, down the principal street of Chelles, then he had turned to the right before reaching the church, into the crossroad leading to Montfermeil, like a person who was acquainted with the country and had been there before.
U||He followed this road rapidly. At the spot where it is intersected by the ancient tree-bordered road which runs from Gagny to Lagny, he heard people coming. He concealed himself precipitately in a ditch, and there waited until the passers-by were at a distance. The precaution was nearly superfluous, however; for, as we have already said, it was a very dark December night. Not more than two or three stars were visible in the sky.
U||It is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins. The man did not return to the road to Montfermeil; he struck across the fields to the right, and entered the forest with long strides.
U||Once in the forest he slackened his pace, and began a careful examination of all the trees, advancing, step by step, as though seeking and following a mysterious road known to himself alone. There came a moment when he appeared to lose himself, and he paused in indecision. At last he arrived, by dint of feeling his way inch by inch, at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones. He stepped up briskly to these stones, and examined them attentively through the mists of night, as though he were passing them in review. A large tree, covered with those excrescences which are the warts of vegetation, stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones. He went up to this tree and passed his hand over the bark of the trunk, as though seeking to recognize and count all the warts.
U||Opposite this tree, which was an ash, there was a chestnut-tree, suffering from a peeling of the bark, to which a band of zinc had been nailed by way of dressing. He raised himself on tiptoe and touched this band of zinc.
U||Then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the space between the tree and the heap of stones, like a person who is trying to assure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed.
U||That done, he took his bearings, and resumed his march through the forest.
U||It was the man who had just met Cosette.
U||As he walked through the thicket in the direction of Montfermeil, he had espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan, depositing a burden on the ground, then taking it up and setting out again. He drew near, and perceived that it was a very young child, laden with an enormous bucket of water. Then he approached the child, and silently grasped the handle of the bucket.
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîCOSETTE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE STRANGER IN THE DARK
U||Cosette, as we have said, was not frightened.
U||The man accosted her. He spoke in a voice that was grave and almost bass.
U||‚ÄúMy child, what you are carrying is very heavy for you.‚Äù
U||Cosette raised her head and replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGive it to me,‚Äù said the man; ‚ÄúI will carry it for you.‚Äù
U||Cosette let go of the bucket-handle. The man walked along beside her.
U||‚ÄúIt really is very heavy,‚Äù he muttered between his teeth. Then he added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHow old are you, little one?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúEight, sir.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd have you come from far like this?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFrom the spring in the forest.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAre you going far?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA good quarter of an hour‚Äôs walk from here.‚Äù
U||The man said nothing for a moment; then he remarked abruptly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSo you have no mother.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù answered the child.
U||Before the man had time to speak again, she added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so. Other people have mothers. I have none.‚Äù
U||And after a silence she went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI think that I never had any.‚Äù
U||The man halted; he set the bucket on the ground, bent down and placed both hands on the child‚Äôs shoulders, making an effort to look at her and to see her face in the dark.
U||Cosette‚Äôs thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light in the sky.
U||‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù said the man.
U||‚ÄúCosette.‚Äù
U||The man seemed to have received an electric shock. He looked at her once more; then he removed his hands from Cosette‚Äôs shoulders, seized the bucket, and set out again.
U||After a moment he inquired:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhere do you live, little one?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAt Montfermeil, if you know where that is.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is where we are going?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù
U||He paused; then began again:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWho sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt was Madame Th√©nardier.‚Äù
U||The man resumed, in a voice which he strove to render indifferent, but in which there was, nevertheless, a singular tremor:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat does your Madame Th√©nardier do?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe is my mistress,‚Äù said the child. ‚ÄúShe keeps the inn.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe inn?‚Äù said the man. ‚ÄúWell, I am going to lodge there to-night. Show me the way.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWe are on the way there,‚Äù said the child.
U||The man walked tolerably fast. Cosette followed him without difficulty. She no longer felt any fatigue. From time to time she raised her eyes towards the man, with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable confidence. She had never been taught to turn to Providence and to pray; nevertheless, she felt within her something which resembled hope and joy, and which mounted towards heaven.
U||Several minutes elapsed. The man resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIs there no servant in Madame Th√©nardier‚Äôs house?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo, sir.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAre you alone there?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù
U||Another pause ensued. Cosette lifted up her voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat is to say, there are two little girls.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat little girls?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPonine and Zelma.‚Äù
U||This was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the female Th√©nardier.
U||‚ÄúWho are Ponine and Zelma?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThey are Madame Th√©nardier‚Äôs young ladies; her daughters, as you would say.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd what do those girls do?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOh!‚Äù said the child, ‚Äúthey have beautiful dolls; things with gold in them, all full of affairs. They play; they amuse themselves.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAll day long?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI? I work.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAll day long?‚Äù
U||The child raised her great eyes, in which hung a tear, which was not visible because of the darkness, and replied gently:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù
U||After an interval of silence she went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSometimes, when I have finished my work and they let me, I amuse myself, too.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHow do you amuse yourself?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn the best way I can. They let me alone; but I have not many playthings. Ponine and Zelma will not let me play with their dolls. I have only a little lead sword, no longer than that.‚Äù
U||The child held up her tiny finger.
U||‚ÄúAnd it will not cut?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù said the child; ‚Äúit cuts salad and the heads of flies.‚Äù
U||They reached the village. Cosette guided the stranger through the streets. They passed the bakeshop, but Cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch. The man had ceased to ply her with questions, and now preserved a gloomy silence.
U||When they had left the church behind them, the man, on perceiving all the open-air booths, asked Cosette:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSo there is a fair going on here?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo, sir; it is Christmas.‚Äù
U||As they approached the tavern, Cosette timidly touched his arm:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat, my child?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWe are quite near the house.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWill you let me take my bucket now?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIf Madame sees that some one has carried it for me, she will beat me.‚Äù
U||The man handed her the bucket. An instant later they were at the tavern door.
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîTHE UNPLEASANTNESS OF RECEIVING INTO ONE‚ÄôS HOUSE A POOR MAN WHO MAY BE A RICH MAN
U||Cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big doll, which was still displayed at the toy-merchant‚Äôs; then she knocked. The door opened. The Th√©nardier appeared with a candle in her hand.
U||‚ÄúAh! so it‚Äôs you, you little wretch! good mercy, but you‚Äôve taken your time! The hussy has been amusing herself!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMadame,‚Äù said Cosette, trembling all over, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a gentleman who wants a lodging.‚Äù
U||The Th√©nardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace, a change of aspect common to tavern-keepers, and eagerly sought the newcomer with her eyes.
U||‚ÄúThis is the gentleman?‚Äù said she.
U||‚ÄúYes, Madame,‚Äù replied the man, raising his hand to his hat.
U||Wealthy travellers are not so polite. This gesture, and an inspection of the stranger‚Äôs costume and baggage, which the Th√©nardier passed in review with one glance, caused the amiable grimace to vanish, and the gruff mien to reappear. She resumed dryly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúEnter, my good man.‚Äù
U||The ‚Äúgood man‚Äù entered. The Th√©nardier cast a second glance at him, paid particular attention to his frock-coat, which was absolutely threadbare, and to his hat, which was a little battered, and, tossing her head, wrinkling her nose, and screwing up her eyes, she consulted her husband, who was still drinking with the carters. The husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger, which, backed up by an inflation of the lips, signifies in such cases: A regular beggar. Thereupon, the Th√©nardier exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAh! see here, my good man; I am very sorry, but I have no room left.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPut me where you like,‚Äù said the man; ‚Äúin the attic, in the stable. I will pay as though I occupied a room.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúForty sous.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúForty sous; agreed.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúVery well, then!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúForty sous!‚Äù said a carter, in a low tone, to the Th√©nardier woman; ‚Äúwhy, the charge is only twenty sous!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt is forty in his case,‚Äù retorted the Th√©nardier, in the same tone. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt lodge poor folks for less.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true,‚Äù added her husband, gently; ‚Äúit ruins a house to have such people in it.‚Äù
U||In the meantime, the man, laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench, had seated himself at a table, on which Cosette made haste to place a bottle of wine and a glass. The merchant who had demanded the bucket of water took it to his horse himself. Cosette resumed her place under the kitchen table, and her knitting.
U||The man, who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had poured out for himself, observed the child with peculiar attention.
U||Cosette was ugly. If she had been happy, she might have been pretty. We have already given a sketch of that sombre little figure. Cosette was thin and pale; she was nearly eight years old, but she seemed to be hardly six. Her large eyes, sunken in a sort of shadow, were almost put out with weeping. The corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people. Her hands were, as her mother had divined, ‚Äúruined with chilblains.‚Äù The fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones, and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent. As she was always shivering, she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees one against the other. Her entire clothing was but a rag which would have inspired pity in summer, and which inspired horror in winter. All she had on was hole-ridden linen, not a scrap of woollen. Her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried, which marked the
U|| places where the Th√©nardier woman had touched her. Her naked legs were thin and red. The hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep. This child‚Äôs whole person, her mien, her attitude, the sound of her voice, the intervals which she allowed to elapse between one word and the next, her glance, her silence, her slightest gesture, expressed and betrayed one sole idea,‚Äîfear.
U||Fear was diffused all over her; she was covered with it, so to speak; fear drew her elbows close to her hips, withdrew her heels under her petticoat, made her occupy as little space as possible, allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary, and had become what might be called the habit of her body, admitting of no possible variation except an increase. In the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook where terror lurked.
U||Her fear was such, that on her arrival, wet as she was, Cosette did not dare to approach the fire and dry herself, but sat silently down to her work again.
U||The expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually so gloomy, and at times so tragic, that it seemed at certain moments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon.
U||As we have stated, she had never known what it is to pray; she had never set foot in a church. ‚ÄúHave I the time?‚Äù said the Th√©nardier.
U||The man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from Cosette.
U||All at once, the Th√©nardier exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBy the way, where‚Äôs that bread?‚Äù
U||Cosette, according to her custom whenever the Th√©nardier uplifted her voice, emerged with great haste from beneath the table.
U||She had completely forgotten the bread. She had recourse to the expedient of children who live in a constant state of fear. She lied.
U||‚ÄúMadame, the baker‚Äôs shop was shut.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou should have knocked.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI did knock, Madame.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe did not open the door.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI‚Äôll find out to-morrow whether that is true,‚Äù said the Th√©nardier; ‚Äúand if you are telling me a lie, I‚Äôll lead you a pretty dance. In the meantime, give me back my fifteen-sou piece.‚Äù
U||Cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron, and turned green. The fifteen-sou piece was not there.
U||‚ÄúAh, come now,‚Äù said Madame Th√©nardier, ‚Äúdid you hear me?‚Äù
U||Cosette turned her pocket inside out; there was nothing in it. What could have become of that money? The unhappy little creature could not find a word to say. She was petrified.
U||‚ÄúHave you lost that fifteen-sou piece?‚Äù screamed the Th√©nardier, hoarsely, ‚Äúor do you want to rob me of it?‚Äù
U||At the same time, she stretched out her arm towards the cat-o‚Äô-nine-tails which hung on a nail in the chimney-corner.
U||This formidable gesture restored to Cosette sufficient strength to shriek:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMercy, Madame, Madame! I will not do so any more!‚Äù
U||The Th√©nardier took down the whip.
U||In the meantime, the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob of his waistcoat, without any one having noticed his movements. Besides, the other travellers were drinking or playing cards, and were not paying attention to anything.
U||Cosette contracted herself into a ball, with anguish, within the angle of the chimney, endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half-nude limbs. The Th√©nardier raised her arm.
U||‚ÄúPardon me, Madame,‚Äù said the man, ‚Äúbut just now I caught sight of something which had fallen from this little one‚Äôs apron pocket, and rolled aside. Perhaps this is it.‚Äù
U||At the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor for a moment.
U||‚ÄúExactly; here it is,‚Äù he went on, straightening himself up.
U||And he held out a silver coin to the Th√©nardier.
U||‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs it,‚Äù said she.
U||It was not it, for it was a twenty-sou piece; but the Th√©nardier found it to her advantage. She put the coin in her pocket, and confined herself to casting a fierce glance at the child, accompanied with the remark, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let this ever happen again!‚Äù
U||Cosette returned to what the Th√©nardier called ‚Äúher kennel,‚Äù and her large eyes, which were riveted on the traveller, began to take on an expression such as they had never worn before. Thus far it was only an innocent amazement, but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with it.
U||‚ÄúBy the way, would you like some supper?‚Äù the Th√©nardier inquired of the traveller.
U||He made no reply. He appeared to be absorbed in thought.
U||‚ÄúWhat sort of a man is that?‚Äù she muttered between her teeth. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs some frightfully poor wretch. He hasn‚Äôt a sou to pay for a supper. Will he even pay me for his lodging? It‚Äôs very lucky, all the same, that it did not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor.‚Äù
U||In the meantime, a door had opened, and √âponine and Azelma entered.
U||They were two really pretty little girls, more bourgeois than peasant in looks, and very charming; the one with shining chestnut tresses, the other with long black braids hanging down her back, both vivacious, neat, plump, rosy, and healthy, and a delight to the eye. They were warmly clad, but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement. There was a hint of winter, though the springtime was not wholly effaced. Light emanated from these two little beings. Besides this, they were on the throne. In their toilettes, in their gayety, in the noise which they made, there was sovereignty. When they entered, the Th√©nardier said to them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration, ‚ÄúAh! there you are, you children!‚Äù
U||Then drawing them, one after the other to her knees, smoothing their hair, tying their ribbons afresh, and then releasing them with that gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers, she exclaimed, ‚ÄúWhat frights they are!‚Äù
U||They went and seated themselves in the chimney-corner. They had a doll, which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous chatter. From time to time Cosette raised her eyes from her knitting, and watched their play with a melancholy air.
U||√âponine and Azelma did not look at Cosette. She was the same as a dog to them. These three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty years between them, but they already represented the whole society of man; envy on the one side, disdain on the other.
U||The doll of the Th√©nardier sisters was very much faded, very old, and much broken; but it seemed nonetheless admirable to Cosette, who had never had a doll in her life, a real doll, to make use of the expression which all children will understand.
U||All at once, the Th√©nardier, who had been going back and forth in the room, perceived that Cosette‚Äôs mind was distracted, and that, instead of working, she was paying attention to the little ones at their play.
U||‚ÄúAh! I‚Äôve caught you at it!‚Äù she cried. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs the way you work! I‚Äôll make you work to the tune of the whip; that I will.‚Äù
U||The stranger turned to the Th√©nardier, without quitting his chair.
U||‚ÄúBah, Madame,‚Äù he said, with an almost timid air, ‚Äúlet her play!‚Äù
U||Such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper, and who had not the air of being frightfully poor, would have been equivalent to an order. But that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a desire, and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a will, was something which Madame Th√©nardier did not intend to tolerate. She retorted with acrimony:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúShe must work, since she eats. I don‚Äôt feed her to do nothing.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is she making?‚Äù went on the stranger, in a gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porter‚Äôs shoulders.
U||The Th√©nardier deigned to reply:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúStockings, if you please. Stockings for my little girls, who have none, so to speak, and who are absolutely barefoot just now.‚Äù
U||The man looked at Cosette‚Äôs poor little red feet, and continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhen will she have finished this pair of stockings?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe has at least three or four good days‚Äô work on them still, the lazy creature!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them?‚Äù
U||The Th√©nardier cast a glance of disdain on him.
U||‚ÄúThirty sous at least.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWill you sell them for five francs?‚Äù went on the man.
U||‚ÄúGood heavens!‚Äù exclaimed a carter who was listening, with a loud laugh; ‚Äúfive francs! the deuce, I should think so! five balls!‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier thought it time to strike in.
U||‚ÄúYes, sir; if such is your fancy, you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five francs. We can refuse nothing to travellers.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou must pay on the spot,‚Äù said the Th√©nardier, in her curt and peremptory fashion.
U||‚ÄúI will buy that pair of stockings,‚Äù replied the man, ‚Äúand,‚Äù he added, drawing a five-franc piece from his pocket, and laying it on the table, ‚ÄúI will pay for them.‚Äù
U||Then he turned to Cosette.
U||‚ÄúNow I own your work; play, my child.‚Äù
U||The carter was so much touched by the five-franc piece, that he abandoned his glass and hastened up.
U||‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs true!‚Äù he cried, examining it. ‚ÄúA real hind wheel! and not counterfeit!‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket.
U||The Th√©nardier had no reply to make. She bit her lips, and her face assumed an expression of hatred.
U||In the meantime, Cosette was trembling. She ventured to ask:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIs it true, Madame? May I play?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPlay!‚Äù said the Th√©nardier, in a terrible voice.
U||‚ÄúThanks, Madame,‚Äù said Cosette.
U||And while her mouth thanked the Th√©nardier, her whole little soul thanked the traveller.
U||Th√©nardier had resumed his drinking; his wife whispered in his ear:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWho can this yellow man be?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have seen millionaires with coats like that,‚Äù replied Th√©nardier, in a sovereign manner.
U||Cosette had dropped her knitting, but had not left her seat. Cosette always moved as little as possible. She picked up some old rags and her little lead sword from a box behind her.
U||√âponine and Azelma paid no attention to what was going on. They had just executed a very important operation; they had just got hold of the cat. They had thrown their doll on the ground, and √âponine, who was the elder, was swathing the little cat, in spite of its mewing and its contortions, in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps. While performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children, whose grace, like the splendor of the butterfly‚Äôs wing, vanishes when one essays to fix it fast.
U||‚ÄúYou see, sister, this doll is more amusing than the other. She twists, she cries, she is warm. See, sister, let us play with her. She shall be my little girl. I will be a lady. I will come to see you, and you shall look at her. Gradually, you will perceive her whiskers, and that will surprise you. And then you will see her ears, and then you will see her tail and it will amaze you. And you will say to me, ‚ÄòAh! Mon Dieu!‚Äô and I will say to you: ‚ÄòYes, Madame, it is my little girl. Little girls are made like that just at present.‚Äô‚Äù
U||Azelma listened admiringly to √âponine.
U||In the meantime, the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song, and to laugh at it until the ceiling shook. Th√©nardier accompanied and encouraged them.
U||As birds make nests out of everything, so children make a doll out of anything which comes to hand. While √âponine and Azelma were bundling up the cat, Cosette, on her side, had dressed up her sword. That done, she laid it in her arms, and sang to it softly, to lull it to sleep.
U||The doll is one of the most imperious needs and, at the same time, one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood. To care for, to clothe, to deck, to dress, to undress, to redress, to teach, scold a little, to rock, to dandle, to lull to sleep, to imagine that something is some one,‚Äîtherein lies the whole woman‚Äôs future. While dreaming and chattering, making tiny outfits, and baby clothes, while sewing little gowns, and corsages and bodices, the child grows into a young girl, the young girl into a big girl, the big girl into a woman. The first child is the continuation of the last doll.
U||A little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy, and quite as impossible, as a woman without children.
U||So Cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword.
U||Madame Th√©nardier approached the yellow man; ‚ÄúMy husband is right,‚Äù she thought; ‚Äúperhaps it is M. Laffitte; there are such queer rich men!‚Äù
U||She came and set her elbows on the table.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur,‚Äù said she. At this word, Monsieur, the man turned; up to that time, the Th√©nardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme.
U||‚ÄúYou see, sir,‚Äù she pursued, assuming a sweetish air that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien, ‚ÄúI am willing that the child should play; I do not oppose it, but it is good for once, because you are generous. You see, she has nothing; she must needs work.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThen this child is not yours?‚Äù demanded the man.
U||‚ÄúOh! mon Dieu! no, sir! she is a little beggar whom we have taken in through charity; a sort of imbecile child. She must have water on the brain; she has a large head, as you see. We do what we can for her, for we are not rich; we have written in vain to her native place, and have received no reply these six months. It must be that her mother is dead.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù said the man, and fell into his reverie once more.
U||‚ÄúHer mother didn‚Äôt amount to much,‚Äù added the Th√©nardier; ‚Äúshe abandoned her child.‚Äù
U||During the whole of this conversation Cosette, as though warned by some instinct that she was under discussion, had not taken her eyes from the Th√©nardier‚Äôs face; she listened vaguely; she caught a few words here and there.
U||Meanwhile, the drinkers, all three-quarters intoxicated, were repeating their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety; it was a highly spiced and wanton song, in which the Virgin and the infant Jesus were introduced. The Th√©nardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter. Cosette, from her post under the table, gazed at the fire, which was reflected from her fixed eyes. She had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made, and, as she rocked it, she sang in a low voice, ‚ÄúMy mother is dead! my mother is dead! my mother is dead!‚Äù
U||On being urged afresh by the hostess, the yellow man, ‚Äúthe millionaire,‚Äù consented at last to take supper.
U||‚ÄúWhat does Monsieur wish?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBread and cheese,‚Äù said the man.
U||‚ÄúDecidedly, he is a beggar‚Äù thought Madame Th√©nardier.
U||The drunken men were still singing their song, and the child under the table was singing hers.
U||All at once, Cosette paused; she had just turned round and caught sight of the little Th√©nardiers‚Äô doll, which they had abandoned for the cat and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table.
U||Then she dropped the swaddled sword, which only half met her needs, and cast her eyes slowly round the room. Madame Th√©nardier was whispering to her husband and counting over some money; Ponine and Zelma were playing with the cat; the travellers were eating or drinking or singing; not a glance was fixed on her. She had not a moment to lose; she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees, made sure once more that no one was watching her; then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized it. An instant later she was in her place again, seated motionless, and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her arms. The happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness.
U||No one had seen her, except the traveller, who was slowly devouring his meagre supper.
U||This joy lasted about a quarter of an hour.
U||But with all the precautions that Cosette had taken she did not perceive that one of the doll‚Äôs legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearth lighted it up very vividly. That pink and shining foot, projecting from the shadow, suddenly struck the eye of Azelma, who said to √âponine, ‚ÄúLook! sister.‚Äù
U||The two little girls paused in stupefaction; Cosette had dared to take their doll!
U||√âponine rose, and, without releasing the cat, she ran to her mother, and began to tug at her skirt.
U||‚ÄúLet me alone!‚Äù said her mother; ‚Äúwhat do you want?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMother,‚Äù said the child, ‚Äúlook there!‚Äù
U||And she pointed to Cosette.
U||Cosette, absorbed in the ecstasies of possession, no longer saw or heard anything.
U||Madame Th√©nardier‚Äôs countenance assumed that peculiar expression which is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life, and which has caused this style of woman to be named Megaeras.
U||On this occasion, wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further. Cosette had overstepped all bounds; Cosette had laid violent hands on the doll belonging to ‚Äúthese young ladies.‚Äù A czarina who should see a muzhik trying on her imperial son‚Äôs blue ribbon would wear no other face.
U||She shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCosette!‚Äù
U||Cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her; she turned round.
U||‚ÄúCosette!‚Äù repeated the Th√©nardier.
U||Cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of veneration, mingled with despair; then, without taking her eyes from it, she clasped her hands, and, what is terrible to relate of a child of that age, she wrung them; then‚Äînot one of the emotions of the day, neither the trip to the forest, nor the weight of the bucket of water, nor the loss of the money, nor the sight of the whip, nor even the sad words which she had heard Madame Th√©nardier utter had been able to wring this from her‚Äîshe wept; she burst out sobbing.
U||Meanwhile, the traveller had risen to his feet.
U||‚ÄúWhat is the matter?‚Äù he said to the Th√©nardier.
U||‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you see?‚Äù said the Th√©nardier, pointing to the corpus delicti which lay at Cosette‚Äôs feet.
U||‚ÄúWell, what of it?‚Äù resumed the man.
U||‚ÄúThat beggar,‚Äù replied the Th√©nardier, ‚Äúhas permitted herself to touch the children‚Äôs doll!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAll this noise for that!‚Äù said the man; ‚Äúwell, what if she did play with that doll?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe touched it with her dirty hands!‚Äù pursued the Th√©nardier, ‚Äúwith her frightful hands!‚Äù
U||Here Cosette redoubled her sobs.
U||‚ÄúWill you stop your noise?‚Äù screamed the Th√©nardier.
U||The man went straight to the street door, opened it, and stepped out.
U||As soon as he had gone, the Th√©nardier profited by his absence to give Cosette a hearty kick under the table, which made the child utter loud cries.
U||The door opened again, the man reappeared; he carried in both hands the fabulous doll which we have mentioned, and which all the village brats had been staring at ever since the morning, and he set it upright in front of Cosette, saying:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHere; this is for you.‚Äù
U||It must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he had spent there he had taken confused notice through his reverie of that toy shop, lighted up by fire-pots and candles so splendidly that it was visible like an illumination through the window of the drinking-shop.
U||Cosette raised her eyes; she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun; she heard the unprecedented words, ‚ÄúIt is for you‚Äù; she stared at him; she stared at the doll; then she slowly retreated, and hid herself at the extreme end, under the table in a corner of the wall.
U||She no longer cried; she no longer wept; she had the appearance of no longer daring to breathe.
U||The Th√©nardier, √âponine, and Azelma were like statues also; the very drinkers had paused; a solemn silence reigned through the whole room.
U||Madame Th√©nardier, petrified and mute, recommenced her conjectures: ‚ÄúWho is that old fellow? Is he a poor man? Is he a millionaire? Perhaps he is both; that is to say, a thief.‚Äù
U||The face of the male Th√©nardier presented that expressive fold which accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears there in all its bestial force. The tavern-keeper stared alternately at the doll and at the traveller; he seemed to be scenting out the man, as he would have scented out a bag of money. This did not last longer than the space of a flash of lightning. He stepped up to his wife and said to her in a low voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat machine costs at least thirty francs. No nonsense. Down on your belly before that man!‚Äù
U||Gross natures have this in common with na√Øve natures, that they possess no transition state.
U||‚ÄúWell, Cosette,‚Äù said the Th√©nardier, in a voice that strove to be sweet, and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women, ‚Äúaren‚Äôt you going to take your doll?‚Äù
U||Cosette ventured to emerge from her hole.
U||‚ÄúThe gentleman has given you a doll, my little Cosette,‚Äù said Th√©nardier, with a caressing air. ‚ÄúTake it; it is yours.‚Äù
U||Cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror. Her face was still flooded with tears, but her eyes began to fill, like the sky at daybreak, with strange beams of joy. What she felt at that moment was a little like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told, ‚ÄúLittle one, you are the Queen of France.‚Äù
U||It seemed to her that if she touched that doll, lightning would dart from it.
U||This was true, up to a certain point, for she said to herself that the Th√©nardier would scold and beat her.
U||Nevertheless, the attraction carried the day. She ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards Madame Th√©nardier:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMay I, Madame?‚Äù
U||No words can render that air, at once despairing, terrified, and ecstatic.
U||‚ÄúPardi!‚Äù cried the Th√©nardier, ‚Äúit is yours. The gentleman has given it to you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTruly, sir?‚Äù said Cosette. ‚ÄúIs it true? Is the ‚Äòlady‚Äô mine?‚Äù
U||The stranger‚Äôs eyes seemed to be full of tears. He appeared to have reached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest he should weep. He nodded to Cosette, and placed the ‚Äúlady‚Äôs‚Äù hand in her tiny hand.
U||Cosette hastily withdrew her hand, as though that of the ‚Äúlady‚Äù scorched her, and began to stare at the floor. We are forced to add that at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately. All at once she wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport.
U||‚ÄúI shall call her Catherine,‚Äù she said.
U||It was an odd moment when Cosette‚Äôs rags met and clasped the ribbons and fresh pink muslins of the doll.
U||‚ÄúMadame,‚Äù she resumed, ‚Äúmay I put her on a chair?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, my child,‚Äù replied the Th√©nardier.
U||It was now the turn of √âponine and Azelma to gaze at Cosette with envy.
U||Cosette placed Catherine on a chair, then seated herself on the floor in front of her, and remained motionless, without uttering a word, in an attitude of contemplation.
U||‚ÄúPlay, Cosette,‚Äù said the stranger.
U||‚ÄúOh! I am playing,‚Äù returned the child.
U||This stranger, this unknown individual, who had the air of a visit which Providence was making on Cosette, was the person whom the Th√©nardier hated worse than any one in the world at that moment. However, it was necessary to control herself. Habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions, these emotions were more than she could endure. She made haste to send her daughters to bed, then she asked the man‚Äôs permission to send Cosette off also; ‚Äúfor she has worked hard all day,‚Äù she added with a maternal air. Cosette went off to bed, carrying Catherine in her arms.
U||From time to time the Th√©nardier went to the other end of the room where her husband was, to relieve her soul, as she said. She exchanged with her husband words which were all the more furious because she dared not utter them aloud.
U||‚ÄúOld beast! What has he got in his belly, to come and upset us in this manner! To want that little monster to play! to give away forty-franc dolls to a jade that I would sell for forty sous, so I would! A little more and he will be saying Your Majesty to her, as though to the Duchesse de Berry! Is there any sense in it? Is he mad, then, that mysterious old fellow?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy! it is perfectly simple,‚Äù replied Th√©nardier, ‚Äúif that amuses him! It amuses you to have the little one work; it amuses him to have her play. He‚Äôs all right. A traveller can do what he pleases when he pays for it. If the old fellow is a philanthropist, what is that to you? If he is an imbecile, it does not concern you. What are you worrying for, so long as he has money?‚Äù
U||The language of a master, and the reasoning of an innkeeper, neither of which admitted of any reply.
U||The man had placed his elbows on the table, and resumed his thoughtful attitude. All the other travellers, both pedlers and carters, had withdrawn a little, and had ceased singing. They were staring at him from a distance, with a sort of respectful awe. This poorly dressed man, who drew ‚Äúhind-wheels‚Äù from his pocket with so much ease, and who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes, was certainly a magnificent fellow, and one to be feared.
U||Many hours passed. The midnight mass was over, the chimes had ceased, the drinkers had taken their departure, the drinking-shop was closed, the public room was deserted, the fire extinct, the stranger still remained in the same place and the same attitude. From time to time he changed the elbow on which he leaned. That was all; but he had not said a word since Cosette had left the room.
U||The Th√©nardiers alone, out of politeness and curiosity, had remained in the room.
U||‚ÄúIs he going to pass the night in that fashion?‚Äù grumbled the Th√©nardier. When two o‚Äôclock in the morning struck, she declared herself vanquished, and said to her husband, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to bed. Do as you like.‚Äù Her husband seated himself at a table in the corner, lighted a candle, and began to read the Courrier Fran√ßais.
U||A good hour passed thus. The worthy inn-keeper had perused the Courrier Fran√ßais at least three times, from the date of the number to the printer‚Äôs name. The stranger did not stir.
U||Th√©nardier fidgeted, coughed, spit, blew his nose, and creaked his chair. Not a movement on the man‚Äôs part. ‚ÄúIs he asleep?‚Äù thought Th√©nardier. The man was not asleep, but nothing could arouse him.
U||At last Th√©nardier took off his cap, stepped gently up to him, and ventured to say:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIs not Monsieur going to his repose?‚Äù
U||Not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar. To repose smacked of luxury and respect. These words possess the mysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day. A chamber where one sleeps costs twenty sous; a chamber in which one reposes costs twenty francs.
U||‚ÄúWell!‚Äù said the stranger, ‚Äúyou are right. Where is your stable?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSir!‚Äù exclaimed Th√©nardier, with a smile, ‚ÄúI will conduct you, sir.‚Äù
U||He took the candle; the man picked up his bundle and cudgel, and Th√©nardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor, which was of rare splendor, all furnished in mahogany, with a low bedstead, curtained with red calico.
U||‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù said the traveller.
U||‚ÄúIt is really our bridal chamber,‚Äù said the tavern-keeper. ‚ÄúMy wife and I occupy another. This is only entered three or four times a year.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI should have liked the stable quite as well,‚Äù said the man, abruptly.
U||Th√©nardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark.
U||He lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the chimney-piece. A very good fire was flickering on the hearth.
U||On the chimney-piece, under a glass globe, stood a woman‚Äôs head-dress in silver wire and orange flowers.
U||‚ÄúAnd what is this?‚Äù resumed the stranger.
U||‚ÄúThat, sir,‚Äù said Th√©nardier, ‚Äúis my wife‚Äôs wedding bonnet.‚Äù
U||The traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say, ‚ÄúThere really was a time, then, when that monster was a maiden?‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier lied, however. When he had leased this paltry building for the purpose of converting it into a tavern, he had found this chamber decorated in just this manner, and had purchased the furniture and obtained the orange flowers at second hand, with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on ‚Äúhis spouse,‚Äù and would result in what the English call respectability for his house.
U||When the traveller turned round, the host had disappeared. Th√©nardier had withdrawn discreetly, without venturing to wish him a good night, as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he proposed to fleece royally the following morning.
U||The inn-keeper retired to his room. His wife was in bed, but she was not asleep. When she heard her husband‚Äôs step she turned over and said to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDo you know, I‚Äôm going to turn Cosette out of doors to-morrow.‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier replied coldly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHow you do go on!‚Äù
U||They exchanged no further words, and a few moments later their candle was extinguished.
U||As for the traveller, he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a corner. The landlord once gone, he threw himself into an armchair and remained for some time buried in thought. Then he removed his shoes, took one of the two candles, blew out the other, opened the door, and quitted the room, gazing about him like a person who is in search of something. He traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase. There he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child. He followed this sound, and came to a sort of triangular recess built under the staircase, or rather formed by the staircase itself. This recess was nothing else than the space under the steps. There, in the midst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds, among dust and spiders‚Äô webs, was a bed‚Äîif one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes as to display the straw, and a coverlet so tattered as to show the pallet. No sheets. This was placed on the floor.
U||In this bed Cosette was sleeping.
U||The man approached and gazed down upon her.
U||Cosette was in a profound sleep; she was fully dressed. In the winter she did not undress, in order that she might not be so cold.
U||Against her breast was pressed the doll, whose large eyes, wide open, glittered in the dark. From time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as though she were on the point of waking, and she strained the doll almost convulsively in her arms. Beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes.
U||A door which stood open near Cosette‚Äôs pallet permitted a view of a rather large, dark room. The stranger stepped into it. At the further extremity, through a glass door, he saw two small, very white beds. They belonged to √âponine and Azelma. Behind these beds, and half hidden, stood an uncurtained wicker cradle, in which the little boy who had cried all the evening lay asleep.
U||The stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the Th√©nardier pair. He was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the fireplace‚Äîone of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire when there is any fire at all, and which are so cold to look at. There was no fire in this one, there was not even ashes; but there was something which attracted the stranger‚Äôs gaze, nevertheless. It was two tiny children‚Äôs shoes, coquettish in shape and unequal in size. The traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the chimney on Christmas eve, there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy. √âponine and Azelma had taken care not to omit this, and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth.
U||The traveller bent over them.
U||The fairy, that is to say, their mother, had already paid her visit, and in each he saw a brand-new and shining ten-sou piece.
U||The man straightened himself up, and was on the point of withdrawing, when far in, in the darkest corner of the hearth, he caught sight of another object. He looked at it, and recognized a wooden shoe, a frightful shoe of the coarsest description, half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mud. It was Cosette‚Äôs sabot. Cosette, with that touching trust of childhood, which can always be deceived yet never discouraged, had placed her shoe on the hearth-stone also.
U||Hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and touching thing.
U||There was nothing in this wooden shoe.
U||The stranger fumbled in his waistcoat, bent over and placed a louis d‚Äôor in Cosette‚Äôs shoe.
U||Then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf.
U||CHAPTER IX‚Äî TH√âNARDIER AND HIS MAN≈íUVRES
U||On the following morning, two hours at least before day-break, Th√©nardier, seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern, pen in hand, was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat.
U||His wife, standing beside him, and half bent over him, was following him with her eyes. They exchanged not a word. On the one hand, there was profound meditation, on the other, the religious admiration with which one watches the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind. A noise was audible in the house; it was the Lark sweeping the stairs.
U||After the lapse of a good quarter of an hour, and some erasures, Th√©nardier produced the following masterpiece:‚Äî
U||BILL OF THE GENTLEMAN IN No. 1.
U||Supper	3 francs.
U||Chamber	10    ‚Äù
U||Candle	5    ‚Äù
U||Fire	4    ‚Äù
U||Service	1    ‚Äù
U||	‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
U||Total	23 francs.
U||Service was written servisse.
U||‚ÄúTwenty-three francs!‚Äù cried the woman, with an enthusiasm which was mingled with some hesitation.
U||Like all great artists, Th√©nardier was dissatisfied.
U||‚ÄúPeuh!‚Äù he exclaimed.
U||It was the accent of Castlereagh auditing France‚Äôs bill at the Congress of Vienna.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Th√©nardier, you are right; he certainly owes that,‚Äù murmured the wife, who was thinking of the doll bestowed on Cosette in the presence of her daughters. ‚ÄúIt is just, but it is too much. He will not pay it.‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier laughed coldly, as usual, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHe will pay.‚Äù
U||This laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority. That which was asserted in this manner must needs be so. His wife did not insist.
U||She set about arranging the table; her husband paced the room. A moment later he added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI owe full fifteen hundred francs!‚Äù
U||He went and seated himself in the chimney-corner, meditating, with his feet among the warm ashes.
U||‚ÄúAh! by the way,‚Äù resumed his wife, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt forget that I‚Äôm going to turn Cosette out of doors to-day? The monster! She breaks my heart with that doll of hers! I‚Äôd rather marry Louis XVIII. than keep her another day in the house!‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier lighted his pipe, and replied between two puffs:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou will hand that bill to the man.‚Äù
U||Then he went out.
U||Hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered.
U||Th√©nardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in the half-open door, visible only to his wife.
U||The yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand.
U||‚ÄúUp so early?‚Äù said Madame Th√©nardier; ‚Äúis Monsieur leaving us already?‚Äù
U||As she spoke thus, she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an embarrassed air, and making creases in it with her nails. Her hard face presented a shade which was not habitual with it,‚Äîtimidity and scruples.
U||To present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air ‚Äúof a poor wretch‚Äù seemed difficult to her.
U||The traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent-minded. He replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYes, Madame, I am going.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSo Monsieur has no business in Montfermeil?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo, I was passing through. That is all. What do I owe you, Madame,‚Äù he added.
U||The Th√©nardier silently handed him the folded bill.
U||The man unfolded the paper and glanced at it; but his thoughts were evidently elsewhere.
U||‚ÄúMadame,‚Äù he resumed, ‚Äúis business good here in Montfermeil?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSo so, Monsieur,‚Äù replied the Th√©nardier, stupefied at not witnessing another sort of explosion.
U||She continued, in a dreary and lamentable tone:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúOh! Monsieur, times are so hard! and then, we have so few bourgeois in the neighborhood! All the people are poor, you see. If we had not, now and then, some rich and generous travellers like Monsieur, we should not get along at all. We have so many expenses. Just see, that child is costing us our very eyes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat child?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy, the little one, you know! Cosette‚Äîthe Lark, as she is called hereabouts!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù said the man.
U||She went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHow stupid these peasants are with their nicknames! She has more the air of a bat than of a lark. You see, sir, we do not ask charity, and we cannot bestow it. We earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal. The license, the imposts, the door and window tax, the hundredths! Monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money. And then, I have my daughters. I have no need to bring up other people‚Äôs children.‚Äù
U||The man resumed, in that voice which he strove to render indifferent, and in which there lingered a tremor:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat if one were to rid you of her?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWho? Cosette?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||The landlady‚Äôs red and violent face brightened up hideously.
U||‚ÄúAh! sir, my dear sir, take her, keep her, lead her off, carry her away, sugar her, stuff her with truffles, drink her, eat her, and the blessings of the good holy Virgin and of all the saints of paradise be upon you!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúReally! You will take her away?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will take her away.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúImmediately?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúImmediately. Call the child.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCosette!‚Äù screamed the Th√©nardier.
U||‚ÄúIn the meantime,‚Äù pursued the man, ‚ÄúI will pay you what I owe you. How much is it?‚Äù
U||He cast a glance on the bill, and could not restrain a start of surprise:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúTwenty-three francs!‚Äù
U||He looked at the landlady, and repeated:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúTwenty-three francs?‚Äù
U||There was in the enunciation of these words, thus repeated, an accent between an exclamation and an interrogation point.
U||The Th√©nardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock. She replied, with assurance:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGood gracious, yes, sir, it is twenty-three francs.‚Äù
U||The stranger laid five five-franc pieces on the table.
U||‚ÄúGo and get the child,‚Äù said he.
U||At that moment Th√©nardier advanced to the middle of the room, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur owes twenty-six sous.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTwenty-six sous!‚Äù exclaimed his wife.
U||‚ÄúTwenty sous for the chamber,‚Äù resumed Th√©nardier, coldly, ‚Äúand six sous for his supper. As for the child, I must discuss that matter a little with the gentleman. Leave us, wife.‚Äù
U||Madame Th√©nardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected lightning flashes of talent. She was conscious that a great actor was making his entrance on the stage, uttered not a word in reply, and left the room.
U||As soon as they were alone, Th√©nardier offered the traveller a chair. The traveller seated himself; Th√©nardier remained standing, and his face assumed a singular expression of good-fellowship and simplicity.
U||‚ÄúSir,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúwhat I have to say to you is this, that I adore that child.‚Äù
U||The stranger gazed intently at him.
U||‚ÄúWhat child?‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHow strange it is, one grows attached. What money is that? Take back your hundred-sou piece. I adore the child.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhom do you mean?‚Äù demanded the stranger.
U||‚ÄúEh! our little Cosette! Are you not intending to take her away from us? Well, I speak frankly; as true as you are an honest man, I will not consent to it. I shall miss that child. I saw her first when she was a tiny thing. It is true that she costs us money; it is true that she has her faults; it is true that we are not rich; it is true that I have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses! But one must do something for the good God‚Äôs sake. She has neither father nor mother. I have brought her up. I have bread enough for her and for myself. In truth, I think a great deal of that child. You understand, one conceives an affection for a person; I am a good sort of a beast, I am; I do not reason; I love that little girl; my wife is quick-tempered, but she loves her also. You see, she is just the same as our own child. I want to keep her to babble about the house.‚Äù
U||The stranger kept his eye intently fixed on Th√©nardier. The latter continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúExcuse me, sir, but one does not give away one‚Äôs child to a passer-by, like that. I am right, am I not? Still, I don‚Äôt say‚Äîyou are rich; you have the air of a very good man,‚Äîif it were for her happiness. But one must find out that. You understand: suppose that I were to let her go and to sacrifice myself, I should like to know what becomes of her; I should not wish to lose sight of her; I should like to know with whom she is living, so that I could go to see her from time to time; so that she may know that her good foster-father is alive, that he is watching over her. In short, there are things which are not possible. I do not even know your name. If you were to take her away, I should say: ‚ÄòWell, and the Lark, what has become of her?‚Äô One must, at least, see some petty scrap of paper, some trifle in the way of a passport, you know!‚Äù
U||The stranger, still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates, as the saying goes, to the very depths of the conscience, replied in a grave, firm voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Th√©nardier, one does not require a passport to travel five leagues from Paris. If I take Cosette away, I shall take her away, and that is the end of the matter. You will not know my name, you will not know my residence, you will not know where she is; and my intention is that she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives. I break the thread which binds her foot, and she departs. Does that suit you? Yes or no?‚Äù
U||Since geniuses, like demons, recognize the presence of a superior God by certain signs, Th√©nardier comprehended that he had to deal with a very strong person. It was like an intuition; he comprehended it with his clear and sagacious promptitude. While drinking with the carters, smoking, and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening, he had devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger, watching him like a cat, and studying him like a mathematician. He had watched him, both on his own account, for the pleasure of the thing, and through instinct, and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so doing. Not a movement, not a gesture, on the part of the man in the yellow great-coat had escaped him. Even before the stranger had so clearly manifested his interest in Cosette, Th√©nardier had divined his purpose. He had caught the old man‚Äôs deep glances returning constantly to the child. Who was this man? Why this interest? Why this hideous costume, when he had so much money in his purse? Que
U||stions which he put to himself without being able to solve them, and which irritated him. He had pondered it all night long. He could not be Cosette‚Äôs father. Was he her grandfather? Then why not make himself known at once? When one has a right, one asserts it. This man evidently had no right over Cosette. What was it, then? Th√©nardier lost himself in conjectures. He caught glimpses of everything, but he saw nothing. Be that as it may, on entering into conversation with the man, sure that there was some secret in the case, that the latter had some interest in remaining in the shadow, he felt himself strong; when he perceived from the stranger‚Äôs clear and firm retort, that this mysterious personage was mysterious in so simple a way, he became conscious that he was weak. He had expected nothing of the sort. His conjectures were put to the rout. He rallied his ideas. He weighed everything in the space of a second. Th√©nardier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance. He decided that the mom
U||ent had arrived for proceeding straightforward, and quickly at that. He did as great leaders do at the decisive moment, which they know that they alone recognize; he abruptly unmasked his batteries.
U||‚ÄúSir,‚Äù said he, ‚ÄúI am in need of fifteen hundred francs.‚Äù
U||The stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather, opened it, drew out three bank-bills, which he laid on the table. Then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the inn-keeper:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGo and fetch Cosette.‚Äù
U||While this was taking place, what had Cosette been doing?
U||On waking up, Cosette had run to get her shoe. In it she had found the gold piece. It was not a Napoleon; it was one of those perfectly new twenty-franc pieces of the Restoration, on whose effigy the little Prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath. Cosette was dazzled. Her destiny began to intoxicate her. She did not know what a gold piece was; she had never seen one; she hid it quickly in her pocket, as though she had stolen it. Still, she felt that it really was hers; she guessed whence her gift had come, but the joy which she experienced was full of fear. She was happy; above all she was stupefied. Such magnificent and beautiful things did not appear real. The doll frightened her, the gold piece frightened her. She trembled vaguely in the presence of this magnificence. The stranger alone did not frighten her. On the contrary, he reassured her. Ever since the preceding evening, amid all her amazement, even in her sleep, she had been thinking in her little childish mind of that man who seemed to be so 
U||poor and so sad, and who was so rich and so kind. Everything had changed for her since she had met that good man in the forest. Cosette, less happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven, had never known what it was to take refuge under a mother‚Äôs shadow and under a wing. For the last five years, that is to say, as far back as her memory ran, the poor child had shivered and trembled. She had always been exposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity; now it seemed to her she was clothed. Formerly her soul had seemed cold, now it was warm. Cosette was no longer afraid of the Th√©nardier. She was no longer alone; there was some one there.
U||She hastily set about her regular morning duties. That louis, which she had about her, in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen-sou piece had fallen on the night before, distracted her thoughts. She dared not touch it, but she spent five minutes in gazing at it, with her tongue hanging out, if the truth must be told. As she swept the staircase, she paused, remained standing there motionless, forgetful of her broom and of the entire universe, occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at the bottom of her pocket.
U||It was during one of these periods of contemplation that the Th√©nardier joined her. She had gone in search of Cosette at her husband‚Äôs orders. What was quite unprecedented, she neither struck her nor said an insulting word to her.
U||‚ÄúCosette,‚Äù she said, almost gently, ‚Äúcome immediately.‚Äù
U||An instant later Cosette entered the public room.
U||The stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it. This bundle contained a little woollen gown, an apron, a fustian bodice, a kerchief, a petticoat, woollen stockings, shoes‚Äîa complete outfit for a girl of seven years. All was black.
U||‚ÄúMy child,‚Äù said the man, ‚Äútake these, and go and dress yourself quickly.‚Äù
U||Daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of Montfermeil who had begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a little girl dressed in mourning, and carrying a pink doll in her arms, pass along the road to Paris. They were going in the direction of Livry.
U||It was our man and Cosette.
U||No one knew the man; as Cosette was no longer in rags, many did not recognize her. Cosette was going away. With whom? She did not know. Whither? She knew not. All that she understood was that she was leaving the Th√©nardier tavern behind her. No one had thought of bidding her farewell, nor had she thought of taking leave of any one. She was leaving that hated and hating house.
U||Poor, gentle creature, whose heart had been repressed up to that hour!
U||Cosette walked along gravely, with her large eyes wide open, and gazing at the sky. She had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron. From time to time, she bent down and glanced at it; then she looked at the good man. She felt something as though she were beside the good God.
U||CHAPTER X‚ÄîHE WHO SEEKS TO BETTER HIMSELF MAY RENDER HIS SITUATION WORSE
U||Madame Th√©nardier had allowed her husband to have his own way, as was her wont. She had expected great results. When the man and Cosette had taken their departure, Th√©nardier allowed a full quarter of an hour to elapse; then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred francs.
U||‚ÄúIs that all?‚Äù said she.
U||It was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had dared to criticise one of the master‚Äôs acts.
U||The blow told.
U||‚ÄúYou are right, in sooth,‚Äù said he; ‚ÄúI am a fool. Give me my hat.‚Äù
U||He folded up the three bank-bills, thrust them into his pocket, and ran out in all haste; but he made a mistake and turned to the right first. Some neighbors, of whom he made inquiries, put him on the track again; the Lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of Livry. He followed these hints, walking with great strides, and talking to himself the while:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat man is evidently a million dressed in yellow, and I am an animal. First he gave twenty sous, then five francs, then fifty francs, then fifteen hundred francs, all with equal readiness. He would have given fifteen thousand francs. But I shall overtake him.‚Äù
U||And then, that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child; all that was singular; many mysteries lay concealed under it. One does not let mysteries out of one‚Äôs hand when one has once grasped them. The secrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold; one must know how to subject them to pressure. All these thoughts whirled through his brain. ‚ÄúI am an animal,‚Äù said he.
U||When one leaves Montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes that runs to Livry, it can be seen stretching out before one to a great distance across the plateau. On arriving there, he calculated that he ought to be able to see the old man and the child. He looked as far as his vision reached, and saw nothing. He made fresh inquiries, but he had wasted time. Some passers-by informed him that the man and child of whom he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of Gagny. He hastened in that direction.
U||They were far in advance of him; but a child walks slowly, and he walked fast; and then, he was well acquainted with the country.
U||All at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a man who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace his steps.
U||‚ÄúI ought to have taken my gun,‚Äù said he to himself.
U||Th√©nardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through our midst without our being aware of the fact, and who disappear without our finding them out, because destiny has only exhibited one side of them. It is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged. In a calm and even situation, Th√©nardier possessed all that is required to make‚Äîwe will not say to be‚Äîwhat people have agreed to call an honest trader, a good bourgeois. At the same time certain circumstances being given, certain shocks arriving to bring his under-nature to the surface, he had all the requisites for a blackguard. He was a shopkeeper in whom there was some taint of the monster. Satan must have occasionally crouched down in some corner of the hovel in which Th√©nardier dwelt, and have fallen a-dreaming in the presence of this hideous masterpiece.
U||After a momentary hesitation:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBah!‚Äù he thought; ‚Äúthey will have time to make their escape.‚Äù
U||And he pursued his road, walking rapidly straight ahead, and with almost an air of certainty, with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey of partridges.
U||In truth, when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an oblique direction the large clearing which lies on the right of the Avenue de Bellevue, and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit of the hill, and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the Abbey of Chelles, he caught sight, over the top of the brushwood, of the hat on which he had already erected so many conjectures; it was that man‚Äôs hat. The brushwood was not high. Th√©nardier recognized the fact that the man and Cosette were sitting there. The child could not be seen on account of her small size, but the head of her doll was visible.
U||Th√©nardier was not mistaken. The man was sitting there, and letting Cosette get somewhat rested. The inn-keeper walked round the brushwood and presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in search of.
U||‚ÄúPardon, excuse me, sir,‚Äù he said, quite breathless, ‚Äúbut here are your fifteen hundred francs.‚Äù
U||So saying, he handed the stranger the three bank-bills.
U||The man raised his eyes.
U||‚ÄúWhat is the meaning of this?‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier replied respectfully:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt means, sir, that I shall take back Cosette.‚Äù
U||Cosette shuddered, and pressed close to the old man.
U||He replied, gazing to the very bottom of Th√©nardier‚Äôs eyes the while, and enunciating every syllable distinctly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou are go-ing to take back Co-sette?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, sir, I am. I will tell you; I have considered the matter. In fact, I have not the right to give her to you. I am an honest man, you see; this child does not belong to me; she belongs to her mother. It was her mother who confided her to me; I can only resign her to her mother. You will say to me, ‚ÄòBut her mother is dead.‚Äô Good; in that case I can only give the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing, signed by her mother, to the effect that I am to hand the child over to the person therein mentioned; that is clear.‚Äù
U||The man, without making any reply, fumbled in his pocket, and Th√©nardier beheld the pocket-book of bank-bills make its appearance once more.
U||The tavern-keeper shivered with joy.
U||‚ÄúGood!‚Äù thought he; ‚Äúlet us hold firm; he is going to bribe me!‚Äù
U||Before opening the pocket-book, the traveller cast a glance about him: the spot was absolutely deserted; there was not a soul either in the woods or in the valley. The man opened his pocket-book once more and drew from it, not the handful of bills which Th√©nardier expected, but a simple little paper, which he unfolded and presented fully open to the inn-keeper, saying:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou are right; read!‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier took the paper and read:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúM. SUR M., March 25, 1823.
U||‚ÄúMONSIEUR TH√âNARDIER:‚Äî
U||You will deliver Cosette to this person.
U||You will be paid for all the little things.
U||I have the honor to salute you with respect,
U||FANTINE.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou know that signature?‚Äù resumed the man.
U||It certainly was Fantine‚Äôs signature; Th√©nardier recognized it.
U||There was no reply to make; he experienced two violent vexations, the vexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for, and the vexation of being beaten; the man added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou may keep this paper as your receipt.‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier retreated in tolerably good order.
U||‚ÄúThis signature is fairly well imitated,‚Äù he growled between his teeth; ‚Äúhowever, let it go!‚Äù
U||Then he essayed a desperate effort.
U||‚ÄúIt is well, sir,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúsince you are the person, but I must be paid for all those little things. A great deal is owing to me.‚Äù
U||The man rose to his feet, filliping the dust from his threadbare sleeve:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Th√©nardier, in January last, the mother reckoned that she owed you one hundred and twenty francs. In February, you sent her a bill of five hundred francs; you received three hundred francs at the end of February, and three hundred francs at the beginning of March. Since then nine months have elapsed, at fifteen francs a month, the price agreed upon, which makes one hundred and thirty-five francs. You had received one hundred francs too much; that makes thirty-five still owing you. I have just given you fifteen hundred francs.‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier‚Äôs sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he feels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap.
U||‚ÄúWho is this devil of a man?‚Äù he thought.
U||He did what the wolf does: he shook himself. Audacity had succeeded with him once.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur-I-don‚Äôt-know-your-name,‚Äù he said resolutely, and this time casting aside all respectful ceremony, ‚ÄúI shall take back Cosette if you do not give me a thousand crowns.‚Äù
U||The stranger said tranquilly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCome, Cosette.‚Äù
U||He took Cosette by his left hand, and with his right he picked up his cudgel, which was lying on the ground.
U||Th√©nardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of the spot.
U||The man plunged into the forest with the child, leaving the inn-keeper motionless and speechless.
U||While they were walking away, Th√©nardier scrutinized his huge shoulders, which were a little rounded, and his great fists.
U||Then, bringing his eyes back to his own person, they fell upon his feeble arms and his thin hands. ‚ÄúI really must have been exceedingly stupid not to have thought to bring my gun,‚Äù he said to himself, ‚Äúsince I was going hunting!‚Äù
U||However, the inn-keeper did not give up.
U||‚ÄúI want to know where he is going,‚Äù said he, and he set out to follow them at a distance. Two things were left on his hands, an irony in the shape of the paper signed Fantine, and a consolation, the fifteen hundred francs.
U||The man led Cosette off in the direction of Livry and Bondy. He walked slowly, with drooping head, in an attitude of reflection and sadness. The winter had thinned out the forest, so that Th√©nardier did not lose them from sight, although he kept at a good distance. The man turned round from time to time, and looked to see if he was being followed. All at once he caught sight of Th√©nardier. He plunged suddenly into the brushwood with Cosette, where they could both hide themselves. ‚ÄúThe deuce!‚Äù said Th√©nardier, and he redoubled his pace.
U||The thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them. When the man had reached the densest part of the thicket, he wheeled round. It was in vain that Th√©nardier sought to conceal himself in the branches; he could not prevent the man seeing him. The man cast upon him an uneasy glance, then elevated his head and continued his course. The inn-keeper set out again in pursuit. Thus they continued for two or three hundred paces. All at once the man turned round once more; he saw the inn-keeper. This time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that Th√©nardier decided that it was ‚Äúuseless‚Äù to proceed further. Th√©nardier retraced his steps.
U||CHAPTER XI‚ÄîNUMBER 9,430 REAPPEARS, AND COSETTE WINS IT IN THE LOTTERY
U||Jean Valjean was not dead.
U||When he fell into the sea, or rather, when he threw himself into it, he was not ironed, as we have seen. He swam under water until he reached a vessel at anchor, to which a boat was moored. He found means of hiding himself in this boat until night. At night he swam off again, and reached the shore a little way from Cape Brun. There, as he did not lack money, he procured clothing. A small country-house in the neighborhood of Balaguier was at that time the dressing-room of escaped convicts,‚Äîa lucrative specialty. Then Jean Valjean, like all the sorry fugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality, pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary. He found his first refuge at Pradeaux, near Beausset. Then he directed his course towards Grand-Villard, near Brian√ßon, in the Hautes-Alpes. It was a fumbling and uneasy flight,‚Äîa mole‚Äôs track, whose branchings are untraceable. Later on, some trace of his passage into Ain, in the territory of Civrieux, was discovered; in the Pyrenees
U||, at Accons; at the spot called Grange-de-Doumec, near the market of Chavailles, and in the environs of Perigueux at Brunies, canton of La Chapelle-Gonaguet. He reached Paris. We have just seen him at Montfermeil.
U||His first care on arriving in Paris had been to buy mourning clothes for a little girl of from seven to eight years of age; then to procure a lodging. That done, he had betaken himself to Montfermeil. It will be remembered that already, during his preceding escape, he had made a mysterious trip thither, or somewhere in that neighborhood, of which the law had gathered an inkling.
U||However, he was thought to be dead, and this still further increased the obscurity which had gathered about him. At Paris, one of the journals which chronicled the fact fell into his hands. He felt reassured and almost at peace, as though he had really been dead.
U||On the evening of the day when Jean Valjean rescued Cosette from the claws of the Th√©nardiers, he returned to Paris. He re-entered it at nightfall, with the child, by way of the Barrier Monceaux. There he entered a cabriolet, which took him to the esplanade of the Observatoire. There he got out, paid the coachman, took Cosette by the hand, and together they directed their steps through the darkness,‚Äîthrough the deserted streets which adjoin the Ourcine and the Glaci√®re, towards the Boulevard de l‚ÄôH√¥pital.
U||The day had been strange and filled with emotions for Cosette. They had eaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns, behind hedges; they had changed carriages frequently; they had travelled short distances on foot. She made no complaint, but she was weary, and Jean Valjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his hand as she walked. He took her on his back. Cosette, without letting go of Catherine, laid her head on Jean Valjean‚Äôs shoulder, and there fell asleep.
U||BOOK FOURTH‚ÄîTHE GORBEAU HOVEL
U||The Gorbeau Hovel
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîMASTER GORBEAU
U||Forty years ago, a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country of the Salp√™tri√®re, and who had mounted to the Barri√®re d‚ÄôItalie by way of the boulevard, reached a point where it might be said that Paris disappeared. It was no longer solitude, for there were passers-by; it was not the country, for there were houses and streets; it was not the city, for the streets had ruts like highways, and the grass grew in them; it was not a village, the houses were too lofty. What was it, then? It was an inhabited spot where there was no one; it was a desert place where there was some one; it was a boulevard of the great city, a street of Paris; more wild at night than the forest, more gloomy by day than a cemetery.
U||It was the old quarter of the March√©-aux-Chevaux.
U||The rambler, if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of this March√©-aux-Chevaux; if he consented even to pass beyond the Rue du Petit-Banquier, after leaving on his right a garden protected by high walls; then a field in which tan-bark mills rose like gigantic beaver huts; then an enclosure encumbered with timber, with a heap of stumps, sawdust, and shavings, on which stood a large dog, barking; then a long, low, utterly dilapidated wall, with a little black door in mourning, laden with mosses, which were covered with flowers in the spring; then, in the most deserted spot, a frightful and decrepit building, on which ran the inscription in large letters: POST NO BILLS,‚Äîthis daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the Rue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel. There, near a factory, and between two garden walls, there could be seen, at that epoch, a mean building, which, at the first glance, seemed as small as a thatched hovel, and which was, in reality, as large as a cathed
U||ral. It presented its side and gable to the public road; hence its apparent diminutiveness. Nearly the whole of the house was hidden. Only the door and one window could be seen.
U||This hovel was only one story high.
U||The first detail that struck the observer was, that the door could never have been anything but the door of a hovel, while the window, if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry, might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion.
U||The door was nothing but a collection of worm-eaten planks roughly bound together by cross-beams which resembled roughly hewn logs. It opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps, muddy, chalky, plaster-stained, dusty steps, of the same width as itself, which could be seen from the street, running straight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls. The top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed, which served both as wicket and air-hole when the door was closed. On the inside of the door the figures 52 had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped in ink, and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number 50, so that one hesitated. Where was one? Above the door it said, ‚ÄúNumber 50‚Äù; the inside replied, ‚Äúno, Number 52.‚Äù No one knows what dust-colored figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular opening.
U||The window was large, sufficiently elevated, garnished with Venetian blinds, and with a frame in large square panes; only these large panes were suffering from various wounds, which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage. And the blinds, dislocated and unpasted, threatened passers-by rather than screened the occupants. The horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been na√Øvely replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly; so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter. This door with an unclean, and this window with an honest though dilapidated air, thus beheld on the same house, produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side, with different miens beneath the same rags, the one having always been a mendicant, and the other having once been a gentleman.
U||The staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which had been converted into a house. This edifice had, for its intestinal tube, a long corridor, on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances, and rather more like stalls than cells. These chambers received their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood.
U||All this was dark, disagreeable, wan, melancholy, sepulchral; traversed according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door, by cold rays or by icy winds. An interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders.
U||To the left of the entrance door, on the boulevard side, at about the height of a man from the ground, a small window which had been walled up formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there as they passed by.
U||A portion of this building has recently been demolished. From what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days. As a whole, it was not over a hundred years old. A hundred years is youth in a church and age in a house. It seems as though man‚Äôs lodging partook of his ephemeral character, and God‚Äôs house of his eternity.
U||The postmen called the house Number 50-52; but it was known in the neighborhood as the Gorbeau house.
U||Let us explain whence this appellation was derived.
U||Collectors of petty details, who become herbalists of anecdotes, and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin, know that there was in Paris, during the last century, about 1770, two attorneys at the Ch√¢telet named, one Corbeau (Raven), the other Renard (Fox). The two names had been forestalled by La Fontaine. The opportunity was too fine for the lawyers; they made the most of it. A parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the court-house, in verses that limped a little:‚Äî
U||Ma√Ætre Corbeau, sur un dossier perch√©,
U||    Tenait dans son bec une saisie ex√©cutoire;
U||Ma√Ætre Renard, par l‚Äôodeur all√©ch√©,
U||    Lui fit √† peu pr√®s cette histoire:
U||        H√©! bonjour. Etc.13
U||The two honest practitioners, embarrassed by the jests, and finding the bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which followed them, resolved to get rid of their names, and hit upon the expedient of applying to the king.
U||Their petition was presented to Louis XV. on the same day when the Papal Nuncio, on the one hand, and the Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon on the other, both devoutly kneeling, were each engaged in putting on, in his Majesty‚Äôs presence, a slipper on the bare feet of Madame du Barry, who had just got out of bed. The king, who was laughing, continued to laugh, passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers, and bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names, or nearly so. By the kings command, Ma√Ætre Corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initial letter and to call himself Gorbeau. Ma√Ætre Renard was less lucky; all he obtained was leave to place a P in front of his R, and to call himself Prenard; so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the first.
U||Now, according to local tradition, this Ma√Ætre Gorbeau had been the proprietor of the building numbered 50-52 on the Boulevard de l‚ÄôH√¥pital. He was even the author of the monumental window.
U||Hence the edifice bore the name of the Gorbeau house.
U||Opposite this house, among the trees of the boulevard, rose a great elm which was three-quarters dead; almost directly facing it opens the Rue de la Barri√®re des Gobelins, a street then without houses, unpaved, planted with unhealthy trees, which was green or muddy according to the season, and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of Paris. An odor of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory.
U||The barrier was close at hand. In 1823 the city wall was still in existence.
U||This barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind. It was the road to Bic√™tre. It was through it that, under the Empire and the Restoration, prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris on the day of their execution. It was there, that, about 1829, was committed that mysterious assassination, called ‚ÄúThe assassination of the Fontainebleau barrier,‚Äù whose authors justice was never able to discover; a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated, a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled. Take a few steps, and you come upon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe, where Ulbach stabbed the goat-girl of Ivry to the sound of thunder, as in the melodramas. A few paces more, and you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms of the Barri√®re Saint-Jacques, that expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold, that miserable and shameful Place de Gr√®ve of a shop-keeping and bourgeois society, which recoiled before the death penalty, neither daring to abolish it with grandeur, nor to uphold it with a
U||uthority.
U||Leaving aside this Place Saint-Jacques, which was, as it were, predestined, and which has always been horrible, probably the most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard, seven and thirty years ago, was the spot which even to-day is so unattractive, where stood the building Number 50-52.
U||Bourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty-five years later. The place was unpleasant. In addition to the gloomy thoughts which assailed one there, one was conscious of being between the Salp√™tri√®re, a glimpse of whose dome could be seen, and Bic√™tre, whose outskirts one was fairly touching; that is to say, between the madness of women and the madness of men. As far as the eye could see, one could perceive nothing but the abattoirs, the city wall, and the fronts of a few factories, resembling barracks or monasteries; everywhere about stood hovels, rubbish, ancient walls blackened like cerecloths, new white walls like winding-sheets; everywhere parallel rows of trees, buildings erected on a line, flat constructions, long, cold rows, and the melancholy sadness of right angles. Not an unevenness of the ground, not a caprice in the architecture, not a fold. The ensemble was glacial, regular, hideous. Nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry. It is because symmetry is ennui, and ennui is at the ver
U||y foundation of grief. Despair yawns. Something more terrible than a hell where one suffers may be imagined, and that is a hell where one is bored. If such a hell existed, that bit of the Boulevard de l‚ÄôH√¥pital might have formed the entrance to it.
U||Nevertheless, at nightfall, at the moment when the daylight is vanishing, especially in winter, at the hour when the twilight breeze tears from the elms their last russet leaves, when the darkness is deep and starless, or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the clouds and losing themselves in the shadows, this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful. The black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades, like morsels of the infinite. The passer-by cannot refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet. The solitude of this spot, where so many crimes have been committed, had something terrible about it. One almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness; all the confused forms of the darkness seemed suspicious, and the long, hollow square, of which one caught a glimpse between each tree, seemed graves: by day it was ugly; in the evening melancholy; by night it was sinister.
U||In summer, at twilight, one saw, here and there, a few old women seated at the foot of the elm, on benches mouldy with rain. These good old women were fond of begging.
U||However, this quarter, which had a superannuated rather than an antique air, was tending even then to transformation. Even at that time any one who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste. Each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing. For the last twenty years the station of the Orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it, as it does to-day. Wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital, a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city. It seems as though, around these great centres of the movements of a people, the earth, full of germs, trembled and yawned, to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth, at the rattle of these powerful machines, at the breath of these monstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire. The old houses crumble and new ones rise.
U||Since the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salp√™tri√®re, the ancient, narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor and the Jardin des Plantes tremble, as they are violently traversed three or four times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses which, in a given time, crowd back the houses to the right and the left; for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact; and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow, it is certain that the frequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets. The symptoms of a new life are evident. In this old provincial quarter, in the wildest nooks, the pavement shows itself, the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer, even where there are as yet no pedestrians. One morning,‚Äîa memorable morning in July, 1845,‚Äîblack pots of bitumen were seen smoking there; on that day it might be said that civilization had arrived in the Rue de l‚ÄôOurcine, and that Pa
U||ris had entered the suburb of Saint-Marceau.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîA NEST FOR OWL AND A WARBLER
U||It was in front of this Gorbeau house that Jean Valjean halted. Like wild birds, he had chosen this desert place to construct his nest.
U||He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket, drew out a sort of a pass-key, opened the door, entered, closed it again carefully, and ascended the staircase, still carrying Cosette.
U||At the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key, with which he opened another door. The chamber which he entered, and which he closed again instantly, was a kind of moderately spacious attic, furnished with a mattress laid on the floor, a table, and several chairs; a stove in which a fire was burning, and whose embers were visible, stood in one corner. A lantern on the boulevard cast a vague light into this poor room. At the extreme end there was a dressing-room with a folding bed; Jean Valjean carried the child to this bed and laid her down there without waking her.
U||He struck a match and lighted a candle. All this was prepared beforehand on the table, and, as he had done on the previous evening, he began to scrutinize Cosette‚Äôs face with a gaze full of ecstasy, in which the expression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to aberration. The little girl, with that tranquil confidence which belongs only to extreme strength and extreme weakness, had fallen asleep without knowing with whom she was, and continued to sleep without knowing where she was.
U||Jean Valjean bent down and kissed that child‚Äôs hand.
U||Nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother, who had also just fallen asleep.
U||The same sad, piercing, religious sentiment filled his heart.
U||He knelt beside Cosette‚Äôs bed.
U||lt was broad daylight, and the child still slept. A wan ray of the December sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the ceiling in long threads of light and shade. All at once a heavily laden carrier‚Äôs cart, which was passing along the boulevard, shook the frail bed, like a clap of thunder, and made it quiver from top to bottom.
U||‚ÄúYes, madame!‚Äù cried Cosette, waking with a start, ‚Äúhere I am! here I am!‚Äù
U||And she sprang out of bed, her eyes still half shut with the heaviness of sleep, extending her arms towards the corner of the wall.
U||‚ÄúAh! mon Dieu, my broom!‚Äù said she.
U||She opened her eyes wide now, and beheld the smiling countenance of Jean Valjean.
U||‚ÄúAh! so it is true!‚Äù said the child. ‚ÄúGood morning, Monsieur.‚Äù
U||Children accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly, being themselves by nature joy and happiness.
U||Cosette caught sight of Catherine at the foot of her bed, and took possession of her, and, as she played, she put a hundred questions to Jean Valjean. Where was she? Was Paris very large? Was Madame Th√©nardier very far away? Was she to go back? etc., etc. All at once she exclaimed, ‚ÄúHow pretty it is here!‚Äù
U||It was a frightful hole, but she felt free.
U||‚ÄúMust I sweep?‚Äù she resumed at last.
U||‚ÄúPlay!‚Äù said Jean Valjean.
U||The day passed thus. Cosette, without troubling herself to understand anything, was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîTWO MISFORTUNES MAKE ONE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE
U||On the following morning, at daybreak, Jean Valjean was still by Cosette‚Äôs bedside; he watched there motionless, waiting for her to wake.
U||Some new thing had come into his soul.
U||Jean Valjean had never loved anything; for twenty-five years he had been alone in the world. He had never been father, lover, husband, friend. In the prison he had been vicious, gloomy, chaste, ignorant, and shy. The heart of that ex-convict was full of virginity. His sister and his sister‚Äôs children had left him only a vague and far-off memory which had finally almost completely vanished; he had made every effort to find them, and not having been able to find them, he had forgotten them. Human nature is made thus; the other tender emotions of his youth, if he had ever had any, had fallen into an abyss.
U||When he saw Cosette, when he had taken possession of her, carried her off, and delivered her, he felt his heart moved within him.
U||All the passion and affection within him awoke, and rushed towards that child. He approached the bed, where she lay sleeping, and trembled with joy. He suffered all the pangs of a mother, and he knew not what it meant; for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing.
U||Poor old man, with a perfectly new heart!
U||Only, as he was five and fifty, and Cosette eight years of age, all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light.
U||It was the second white apparition which he had encountered. The Bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon; Cosette caused the dawn of love to rise.
U||The early days passed in this dazzled state.
U||Cosette, on her side, had also, unknown to herself, become another being, poor little thing! She was so little when her mother left her, that she no longer remembered her. Like all children, who resemble young shoots of the vine, which cling to everything, she had tried to love; she had not succeeded. All had repulsed her,‚Äîthe Th√©nardiers, their children, other children. She had loved the dog, and he had died, after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her. It is a sad thing to say, and we have already intimated it, that, at eight years of age, her heart was cold. It was not her fault; it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked; alas! it was the possibility. Thus, from the very first day, all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man. She felt that which she had never felt before‚Äîa sensation of expansion.
U||The man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor; she thought Jean Valjean handsome, just as she thought the hovel pretty.
U||These are the effects of the dawn, of childhood, of joy. The novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here. Nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret. We all have in our past a delightful garret.
U||Nature, a difference of fifty years, had set a profound gulf between Jean Valjean and Cosette; destiny filled in this gulf. Destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences, differing in age, alike in sorrow. One, in fact, completed the other. Cosette‚Äôs instinct sought a father, as Jean Valjean‚Äôs instinct sought a child. To meet was to find each other. At the mysterious moment when their hands touched, they were welded together. When these two souls perceived each other, they recognized each other as necessary to each other, and embraced each other closely.
U||Taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense, we may say that, separated from every one by the walls of the tomb, Jean Valjean was the widower, and Cosette was the orphan: this situation caused Jean Valjean to become Cosette‚Äôs father after a celestial fashion.
U||And in truth, the mysterious impression produced on Cosette in the depths of the forest of Chelles by the hand of Jean Valjean grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion, but a reality. The entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of God.
U||Moreover, Jean Valjean had chosen his refuge well. There he seemed perfectly secure.
U||The chamber with a dressing-room, which he occupied with Cosette, was the one whose window opened on the boulevard. This being the only window in the house, no neighbors‚Äô glances were to be feared from across the way or at the side.
U||The ground floor of Number 50-52, a sort of dilapidated penthouse, served as a wagon-house for market-gardeners, and no communication existed between it and the first story. It was separated by the flooring, which had neither traps nor stairs, and which formed the diaphragm of the building, as it were. The first story contained, as we have said, numerous chambers and several attics, only one of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of Jean Valjean‚Äôs housekeeping; all the rest was uninhabited.
U||It was this old woman, ornamented with the name of the principal lodger, and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress, who had let him the lodging on Christmas eve. He had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by Spanish bonds, who was coming there to live with his little daughter. He had paid her six months in advance, and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and dressing-room, as we have seen. It was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove, and prepared everything on the evening of their arrival.
U||Week followed week; these two beings led a happy life in that hovel.
U||Cosette laughed, chattered, and sang from daybreak. Children have their morning song as well as birds.
U||It sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red hand, all cracked with chilblains, and kissed it. The poor child, who was used to being beaten, did not know the meaning of this, and ran away in confusion.
U||At times she became serious and stared at her little black gown. Cosette was no longer in rags; she was in mourning. She had emerged from misery, and she was entering into life.
U||Jean Valjean had undertaken to teach her to read. Sometimes, as he made the child spell, he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison. This idea had ended in teaching a child to read. Then the ex-convict smiled with the pensive smile of the angels.
U||He felt in it a premeditation from on high, the will of some one who was not man, and he became absorbed in reverie. Good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones.
U||To teach Cosette to read, and to let her play, this constituted nearly the whole of Jean Valjean‚Äôs existence. And then he talked of her mother, and he made her pray.
U||She called him father, and knew no other name for him.
U||He passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll, and in listening to her prattle. Life, henceforth, appeared to him to be full of interest; men seemed to him good and just; he no longer reproached any one in thought; he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man, now that this child loved him. He saw a whole future stretching out before him, illuminated by Cosette as by a charming light. The best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts. At times, he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly.
U||This is only a personal opinion; but, to utter our whole thought, at the point where Jean Valjean had arrived when he began to love Cosette, it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in order that he might persevere in well-doing. He had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect‚Äîincomplete aspects, which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth, the fate of woman as summed up in Fantine, and public authority as personified in Javert. He had returned to prison, this time for having done right; he had quaffed fresh bitterness; disgust and lassitude were overpowering him; even the memory of the Bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse, though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant; but, after all, that sacred memory was growing dim. Who knows whether Jean Valjean had not been on the eve of growing discouraged and of falling once more? He loved and grew strong again. Alas! he walked with no less indecision than Cosette. He pr
U||otected her, and she strengthened him. Thanks to him, she could walk through life; thanks to her, he could continue in virtue. He was that child‚Äôs stay, and she was his prop. Oh, unfathomable and divine mystery of the balances of destiny!
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîTHE REMARKS OF THE PRINCIPAL TENANT
U||Jean Valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day. Every evening, at twilight, he walked for an hour or two, sometimes alone, often with Cosette, seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard, and entering churches at nightfall. He liked to go to Saint-M√©dard, which is the nearest church. When he did not take Cosette with him, she remained with the old woman; but the child‚Äôs delight was to go out with the good man. She preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous t√™te-√†-t√™tes with Catherine. He held her hand as they walked, and said sweet things to her.
U||It turned out that Cosette was a very gay little person.
U||The old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to market.
U||They lived soberly, always having a little fire, but like people in very moderate circumstances. Jean Valjean had made no alterations in the furniture as it was the first day; he had merely had the glass door leading to Cosette‚Äôs dressing-room replaced by a solid door.
U||He still wore his yellow coat, his black breeches, and his old hat. In the street, he was taken for a poor man. It sometimes happened that kind-hearted women turned back to bestow a sou on him. Jean Valjean accepted the sou with a deep bow. It also happened occasionally that he encountered some poor wretch asking alms; then he looked behind him to make sure that no one was observing him, stealthily approached the unfortunate man, put a piece of money into his hand, often a silver coin, and walked rapidly away. This had its disadvantages. He began to be known in the neighborhood under the name of the beggar who gives alms.
U||The old principal lodger, a cross-looking creature, who was thoroughly permeated, so far as her neighbors were concerned, with the inquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons, scrutinized Jean Valjean a great deal, without his suspecting the fact. She was a little deaf, which rendered her talkative. There remained to her from her past, two teeth,‚Äîone above, the other below,‚Äîwhich she was continually knocking against each other. She had questioned Cosette, who had not been able to tell her anything, since she knew nothing herself except that she had come from Montfermeil. One morning, this spy saw Jean Valjean, with an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar, entering one of the uninhabited compartments of the hovel. She followed him with the step of an old cat, and was able to observe him without being seen, through a crack in the door, which was directly opposite him. Jean Valjean had his back turned towards this door, by way of greater security, no doubt. The old woman saw him fumble in his pocket 
U||and draw thence a case, scissors, and thread; then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his coat, and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper, which he unfolded. The old woman recognized, with terror, the fact that it was a bank-bill for a thousand francs. It was the second or third only that she had seen in the course of her existence. She fled in alarm.
U||A moment later, Jean Valjean accosted her, and asked her to go and get this thousand-franc bill changed for him, adding that it was his quarterly income, which he had received the day before. ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù thought the old woman. ‚ÄúHe did not go out until six o‚Äôclock in the evening, and the government bank certainly is not open at that hour.‚Äù The old woman went to get the bill changed, and mentioned her surmises. That thousand-franc note, commented on and multiplied, produced a vast amount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the Rue des Vignes Saint-Marcel.
U||A few days later, it chanced that Jean Valjean was sawing some wood, in his shirt-sleeves, in the corridor. The old woman was in the chamber, putting things in order. She was alone. Cosette was occupied in admiring the wood as it was sawed. The old woman caught sight of the coat hanging on a nail, and examined it. The lining had been sewed up again. The good woman felt of it carefully, and thought she observed in the skirts and revers thicknesses of paper. More thousand-franc bank-bills, no doubt!
U||She also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets. Not only the needles, thread, and scissors which she had seen, but a big pocket-book, a very large knife, and‚Äîa suspicious circumstance‚Äîseveral wigs of various colors. Each pocket of this coat had the air of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents.
U||Thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîA FIVE-FRANC PIECE FALLS ON THE GROUND AND PRODUCES A TUMULT
U||Near Saint-M√©dard‚Äôs church there was a poor man who was in the habit of crouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned, and on whom Jean Valjean was fond of bestowing charity. He never passed this man without giving him a few sous. Sometimes he spoke to him. Those who envied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police. He was an ex-beadle of seventy-five, who was constantly mumbling his prayers.
U||One evening, as Jean Valjean was passing by, when he had not Cosette with him, he saw the beggar in his usual place, beneath the lantern which had just been lighted. The man seemed engaged in prayer, according to his custom, and was much bent over. Jean Valjean stepped up to him and placed his customary alms in his hand. The mendicant raised his eyes suddenly, stared intently at Jean Valjean, then dropped his head quickly. This movement was like a flash of lightning. Jean Valjean was seized with a shudder. It seemed to him that he had just caught sight, by the light of the street lantern, not of the placid and beaming visage of the old beadle, but of a well-known and startling face. He experienced the same impression that one would have on finding one‚Äôs self, all of a sudden, face to face, in the dark, with a tiger. He recoiled, terrified, petrified, daring neither to breathe, to speak, to remain, nor to flee, staring at the beggar who had dropped his head, which was enveloped in a rag, and no longer appea
U||red to know that he was there. At this strange moment, an instinct‚Äîpossibly the mysterious instinct of self-preservation,‚Äîrestrained Jean Valjean from uttering a word. The beggar had the same figure, the same rags, the same appearance as he had every day. ‚ÄúBah!‚Äù said Jean Valjean, ‚ÄúI am mad! I am dreaming! Impossible!‚Äù And he returned profoundly troubled.
U||He hardly dared to confess, even to himself, that the face which he thought he had seen was the face of Javert.
U||That night, on thinking the matter over, he regretted not having questioned the man, in order to force him to raise his head a second time.
U||On the following day, at nightfall, he went back. The beggar was at his post. ‚ÄúGood day, my good man,‚Äù said Jean Valjean, resolutely, handing him a sou. The beggar raised his head, and replied in a whining voice, ‚ÄúThanks, my good sir.‚Äù It was unmistakably the ex-beadle.
U||Jean Valjean felt completely reassured. He began to laugh. ‚ÄúHow the deuce could I have thought that I saw Javert there?‚Äù he thought. ‚ÄúAm I going to lose my eyesight now?‚Äù And he thought no more about it.
U||A few days afterwards,‚Äîit might have been at eight o‚Äôclock in the evening,‚Äîhe was in his room, and engaged in making Cosette spell aloud, when he heard the house door open and then shut again. This struck him as singular. The old woman, who was the only inhabitant of the house except himself, always went to bed at nightfall, so that she might not burn out her candles. Jean Valjean made a sign to Cosette to be quiet. He heard some one ascending the stairs. It might possibly be the old woman, who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary‚Äôs. Jean Valjean listened.
U||The step was heavy, and sounded like that of a man; but the old woman wore stout shoes, and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the step of a man as that of an old woman. Nevertheless, Jean Valjean blew out his candle.
U||He had sent Cosette to bed, saying to her in a low voice, ‚ÄúGet into bed very softly‚Äù; and as he kissed her brow, the steps paused.
U||Jean Valjean remained silent, motionless, with his back towards the door, seated on the chair from which he had not stirred, and holding his breath in the dark.
U||After the expiration of a rather long interval, he turned round, as he heard nothing more, and, as he raised his eyes towards the door of his chamber, he saw a light through the keyhole. This light formed a sort of sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall. There was evidently some one there, who was holding a candle in his hand and listening.
U||Several minutes elapsed thus, and the light retreated. But he heard no sound of footsteps, which seemed to indicate that the person who had been listening at the door had removed his shoes.
U||Jean Valjean threw himself, all dressed as he was, on his bed, and could not close his eyes all night.
U||At daybreak, just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue, he was awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the end of the corridor, then he heard the same masculine footstep which had ascended the stairs on the preceding evening. The step was approaching. He sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole, which was tolerably large, hoping to see the person who had made his way by night into the house and had listened at his door, as he passed. It was a man, in fact, who passed, this time without pausing, in front of Jean Valjean‚Äôs chamber. The corridor was too dark to allow of the person‚Äôs face being distinguished; but when the man reached the staircase, a ray of light from without made it stand out like a silhouette, and Jean Valjean had a complete view of his back. The man was of lofty stature, clad in a long frock-coat, with a cudgel under his arm. The formidable neck and shoulders belonged to Javert.
U||Jean Valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him through his window opening on the boulevard, but he would have been obliged to open the window: he dared not.
U||It was evident that this man had entered with a key, and like himself. Who had given him that key? What was the meaning of this?
U||When the old woman came to do the work, at seven o‚Äôclock in the morning, Jean Valjean cast a penetrating glance on her, but he did not question her. The good woman appeared as usual.
U||As she swept up she remarked to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúPossibly Monsieur may have heard some one come in last night?‚Äù
U||At that age, and on that boulevard, eight o‚Äôclock in the evening was the dead of the night.
U||‚ÄúThat is true, by the way,‚Äù he replied, in the most natural tone possible. ‚ÄúWho was it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt was a new lodger who has come into the house,‚Äù said the old woman.
U||‚ÄúAnd what is his name?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know exactly; Dumont, or Daumont, or some name of that sort.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd who is this Monsieur Dumont?‚Äù
U||The old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes, and answered:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúA gentleman of property, like yourself.‚Äù
U||Perhaps she had no ulterior meaning. Jean Valjean thought he perceived one.
U||When the old woman had taken her departure, he did up a hundred francs which he had in a cupboard, into a roll, and put it in his pocket. In spite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that he might not be heard rattling silver, a hundred-sou piece escaped from his hands and rolled noisily on the floor.
U||When darkness came on, he descended and carefully scrutinized both sides of the boulevard. He saw no one. The boulevard appeared to be absolutely deserted. It is true that a person can conceal himself behind trees.
U||He went upstairs again.
U||‚ÄúCome.‚Äù he said to Cosette.
U||He took her by the hand, and they both went out.
U||BOOK FIFTH‚ÄîFOR A BLACK HUNT, A MUTE PACK
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîTHE ZIGZAGS OF STRATEGY
U||An observation here becomes necessary, in view of the pages which the reader is about to peruse, and of others which will be met with further on.
U||The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself, has been absent from Paris for many years. Paris has been transformed since he quitted it. A new city has arisen, which is, after a fashion, unknown to him. There is no need for him to say that he loves Paris: Paris is his mind‚Äôs natal city. In consequence of demolitions and reconstructions, the Paris of his youth, that Paris which he bore away religiously in his memory, is now a Paris of days gone by. He must be permitted to speak of that Paris as though it still existed. It is possible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says, ‚ÄúIn such a street there stands such and such a house,‚Äù neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality. Readers may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble. For his own part, he is unacquainted with the new Paris, and he writes with the old Paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him. It is a delight to him to dream that there still lingers b
U||ehind him something of that which he beheld when he was in his own country, and that all has not vanished. So long as you go and come in your native land, you imagine that those streets are a matter of indifference to you; that those windows, those roofs, and those doors are nothing to you; that those walls are strangers to you; that those trees are merely the first encountered haphazard; that those houses, which you do not enter, are useless to you; that the pavements which you tread are merely stones. Later on, when you are no longer there, you perceive that the streets are dear to you; that you miss those roofs, those doors; and that those walls are necessary to you, those trees are well beloved by you; that you entered those houses which you never entered, every day, and that you have left a part of your heart, of your blood, of your soul, in those pavements. All those places which you no longer behold, which you may never behold again, perchance, and whose memory you have cherished, take on a melancholy
U|| charm, recur to your mind with the melancholy of an apparition, make the holy land visible to you, and are, so to speak, the very form of France, and you love them; and you call them up as they are, as they were, and you persist in this, and you will submit to no change: for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face of your mother.
U||May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present? That said, we beg the reader to take note of it, and we continue.
U||Jean Valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the streets, taking the most intricate lines which he could devise, returning on his track at times, to make sure that he was not being followed.
U||The Black Hunt
U||This man≈ìuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag. On soil where an imprint of the track may be left, this man≈ìuvre possesses, among other advantages, that of deceiving the huntsmen and the dogs, by throwing them on the wrong scent. In venery this is called false re-imbushment.
U||The moon was full that night. Jean Valjean was not sorry for this. The moon, still very close to the horizon, cast great masses of light and shadow in the streets. Jean Valjean could glide along close to the houses on the dark side, and yet keep watch on the light side. He did not, perhaps, take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the dark side escaped him. Still, in the deserted lanes which lie near the Rue Poliveau, he thought he felt certain that no one was following him.
U||Cosette walked on without asking any questions. The sufferings of the first six years of her life had instilled something passive into her nature. Moreover,‚Äîand this is a remark to which we shall frequently have occasion to recur,‚Äîshe had grown used, without being herself aware of it, to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of destiny. And then she was with him, and she felt safe.
U||Jean Valjean knew no more where he was going than did Cosette. He trusted in God, as she trusted in him. It seemed as though he also were clinging to the hand of some one greater than himself; he thought he felt a being leading him, though invisible. However, he had no settled idea, no plan, no project. He was not even absolutely sure that it was Javert, and then it might have been Javert, without Javert knowing that he was Jean Valjean. Was not he disguised? Was not he believed to be dead? Still, queer things had been going on for several days. He wanted no more of them. He was determined not to return to the Gorbeau house. Like the wild animal chased from its lair, he was seeking a hole in which he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell.
U||Jean Valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the Mouffetard quarter, which was already asleep, as though the discipline of the Middle Ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed; he combined in various manners, with cunning strategy, the Rue Censier and the Rue Copeau, the Rue du Battoir-Saint-Victor and the Rue du Puits l‚ÄôErmite. There are lodging houses in this locality, but he did not even enter one, finding nothing which suited him. He had no doubt that if any one had chanced to be upon his track, they would have lost it.
U||As eleven o‚Äôclock struck from Saint-√âtienne-du-Mont, he was traversing the Rue de Pontoise, in front of the office of the commissary of police, situated at No. 14. A few moments later, the instinct of which we have spoken above made him turn round. At that moment he saw distinctly, thanks to the commissary‚Äôs lantern, which betrayed them, three men who were following him closely, pass, one after the other, under that lantern, on the dark side of the street. One of the three entered the alley leading to the commissary‚Äôs house. The one who marched at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious.
U||‚ÄúCome, child,‚Äù he said to Cosette; and he made haste to quit the Rue Pontoise.
U||He took a circuit, turned into the Passage des Patriarches, which was closed on account of the hour, strode along the Rue de l‚Äô√âp√©e-de-Bois and the Rue de l‚ÄôArbal√®te, and plunged into the Rue des Postes.
U||At that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets, where the College Rollin stands to-day, and where the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevi√®ve turns off.
U||It is understood, of course, that the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevi√®ve is an old street, and that a posting-chaise does not pass through the Rue des Postes once in ten years. In the thirteenth century this Rue des Postes was inhabited by potters, and its real name is Rue des Pots.
U||The moon cast a livid light into this open space. Jean Valjean went into ambush in a doorway, calculating that if the men were still following him, he could not fail to get a good look at them, as they traversed this illuminated space.
U||In point of fact, three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their appearance. There were four of them now. All were tall, dressed in long, brown coats, with round hats, and huge cudgels in their hands. Their great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming than did their sinister stride through the darkness. One would have pronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois.
U||They halted in the middle of the space and formed a group, like men in consultation. They had an air of indecision. The one who appeared to be their leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in the direction which Jean Valjean had taken; another seemed to indicate the contrary direction with considerable obstinacy. At the moment when the first man wheeled round, the moon fell full in his face. Jean Valjean recognized Javert perfectly.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîIT IS LUCKY THAT THE PONT D‚ÄôAUSTERLITZ BEARS CARRIAGES
U||Uncertainty was at an end for Jean Valjean: fortunately it still lasted for the men. He took advantage of their hesitation. It was time lost for them, but gained for him. He slipped from under the gate where he had concealed himself, and went down the Rue des Postes, towards the region of the Jardin des Plantes. Cosette was beginning to be tired. He took her in his arms and carried her. There were no passers-by, and the street lanterns had not been lighted on account of there being a moon.
U||He redoubled his pace.
U||In a few strides he had reached the Goblet potteries, on the front of which the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancient inscription:‚Äî
U||De Goblet fils c‚Äôest ici la fabrique;
U||Venez choisir des cruches et des brocs,
U||Des pots √† fleurs, des tuyaux, de la brique.
U||√Ä tout venant le C≈ìur vend des Carreaux.14
U||He left behind him the Rue de la Clef, then the Fountain Saint-Victor, skirted the Jardin des Plantes by the lower streets, and reached the quay. There he turned round. The quay was deserted. The streets were deserted. There was no one behind him. He drew a long breath.
U||He gained the Pont d‚ÄôAusterlitz.
U||Tolls were still collected there at that epoch.
U||He presented himself at the toll office and handed over a sou.
U||‚ÄúIt is two sous,‚Äù said the old soldier in charge of the bridge. ‚ÄúYou are carrying a child who can walk. Pay for two.‚Äù
U||He paid, vexed that his passage should have aroused remark. Every flight should be an imperceptible slipping away.
U||A heavy cart was crossing the Seine at the same time as himself, and on its way, like him, to the right bank. This was of use to him. He could traverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart.
U||Towards the middle of the Bridge, Cosette, whose feet were benumbed, wanted to walk. He set her on the ground and took her hand again.
U||The bridge once crossed, he perceived some timber-yards on his right. He directed his course thither. In order to reach them, it was necessary to risk himself in a tolerably large unsheltered and illuminated space. He did not hesitate. Those who were on his track had evidently lost the scent, and Jean Valjean believed himself to be out of danger. Hunted, yes; followed, no.
U||A little street, the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, opened out between two timber-yards enclosed in walls. This street was dark and narrow and seemed made expressly for him. Before entering it he cast a glance behind him.
U||From the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the Pont d‚ÄôAusterlitz.
U||Four shadows were just entering on the bridge.
U||These shadows had their backs turned to the Jardin des Plantes and were on their way to the right bank.
U||These four shadows were the four men.
U||Jean Valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured.
U||One hope remained to him; it was, that the men had not, perhaps, stepped on the bridge, and had not caught sight of him while he was crossing the large illuminated space, holding Cosette by the hand.
U||In that case, by plunging into the little street before him, he might escape, if he could reach the timber-yards, the marshes, the market-gardens, the uninhabited ground which was not built upon.
U||It seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent little street. He entered it.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîTO WIT, THE PLAN OF PARIS IN 1727
U||Three hundred paces further on, he arrived at a point where the street forked. It separated into two streets, which ran in a slanting line, one to the right, and the other to the left.
U||Jean Valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of a Y. Which should he choose? He did not hesitate, but took the one on the right.
U||Why?
U||Because that to the left ran towards a suburb, that is to say, towards inhabited regions, and the right branch towards the open country, that is to say, towards deserted regions.
U||However, they no longer walked very fast. Cosette‚Äôs pace retarded Jean Valjean‚Äôs.
U||He took her up and carried her again. Cosette laid her head on the shoulder of the good man and said not a word.
U||He turned round from time to time and looked behind him. He took care to keep always on the dark side of the street. The street was straight in his rear. The first two or three times that he turned round he saw nothing; the silence was profound, and he continued his march somewhat reassured. All at once, on turning round, he thought he perceived in the portion of the street which he had just passed through, far off in the obscurity, something which was moving.
U||He rushed forward precipitately rather than walked, hoping to find some side-street, to make his escape through it, and thus to break his scent once more.
U||He arrived at a wall.
U||This wall, however, did not absolutely prevent further progress; it was a wall which bordered a transverse street, in which the one he had taken ended.
U||Here again, he was obliged to come to a decision; should he go to the right or to the left.
U||He glanced to the right. The fragmentary lane was prolonged between buildings which were either sheds or barns, then ended at a blind alley. The extremity of the cul-de-sac was distinctly visible,‚Äîa lofty white wall.
U||He glanced to the left. On that side the lane was open, and about two hundred paces further on, ran into a street of which it was the affluent. On that side lay safety.
U||At the moment when Jean Valjean was meditating a turn to the left, in an effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane, he perceived a sort of motionless, black statue at the corner of the lane and the street towards which he was on the point of directing his steps.
U||It was some one, a man, who had evidently just been posted there, and who was barring the passage and waiting.
U||Jean Valjean recoiled.
U||The point of Paris where Jean Valjean found himself, situated between the Faubourg Saint-Antoine and la R√¢p√©e, is one of those which recent improvements have transformed from top to bottom,‚Äîresulting in disfigurement according to some, and in a transfiguration according to others. The market-gardens, the timber-yards, and the old buildings have been effaced. To-day, there are brand-new, wide streets, arenas, circuses, hippodromes, railway stations, and a prison, Mazas, there; progress, as the reader sees, with its antidote.
U||Half a century ago, in that ordinary, popular tongue, which is all compounded of traditions, which persists in calling the Institut les Quatre-Nations, and the Opera-Comique Feydeau, the precise spot whither Jean Valjean had arrived was called le Petit-Picpus. The Porte Saint-Jacques, the Porte Paris, the Barri√®re des Sergents, the Porcherons, la Galiote, les C√©lestins, les Capucins, le Mail, la Bourbe, l‚ÄôArbre de Cracovie, la Petite-Pologne‚Äîthese are the names of old Paris which survive amid the new. The memory of the populace hovers over these relics of the past.
U||Le Petit-Picpus, which, moreover, hardly ever had any existence, and never was more than the outline of a quarter, had nearly the monkish aspect of a Spanish town. The roads were not much paved; the streets were not much built up. With the exception of the two or three streets, of which we shall presently speak, all was wall and solitude there. Not a shop, not a vehicle, hardly a candle lighted here and there in the windows; all lights extinguished after ten o‚Äôclock. Gardens, convents, timber-yards, marshes; occasional lowly dwellings and great walls as high as the houses.
U||Such was this quarter in the last century. The Revolution snubbed it soundly. The republican government demolished and cut through it. Rubbish shoots were established there. Thirty years ago, this quarter was disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings. To-day, it has been utterly blotted out. The Petit-Picpus, of which no existing plan has preserved a trace, is indicated with sufficient clearness in the plan of 1727, published at Paris by Denis Thierry, Rue Saint-Jacques, opposite the Rue du Pl√¢tre; and at Lyons, by Jean Girin, Rue Merci√®re, at the sign of Prudence. Petit-Picpus had, as we have just mentioned, a Y of streets, formed by the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, which spread out in two branches, taking on the left the name of Little Picpus Street, and on the right the name of the Rue Polonceau. The two limbs of the Y were connected at the apex as by a bar; this bar was called Rue Droit-Mur. The Rue Polonceau ended there; Rue Petit-Picpus passed on, and ascended towards the Lenoir ma
U||rket. A person coming from the Seine reached the extremity of the Rue Polonceau, and had on his right the Rue Droit-Mur, turning abruptly at a right angle, in front of him the wall of that street, and on his right a truncated prolongation of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had no issue and was called the Cul-de-Sac Genrot.
U||It was here that Jean Valjean stood.
U||As we have just said, on catching sight of that black silhouette standing on guard at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur and the Rue Petit-Picpus, he recoiled. There could be no doubt of it. That phantom was lying in wait for him.
U||What was he to do?
U||The time for retreating was passed. That which he had perceived in movement an instant before, in the distant darkness, was Javert and his squad without a doubt. Javert was probably already at the commencement of the street at whose end Jean Valjean stood. Javert, to all appearances, was acquainted with this little labyrinth, and had taken his precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit. These surmises, which so closely resembled proofs, whirled suddenly, like a handful of dust caught up by an unexpected gust of wind, through Jean Valjean‚Äôs mournful brain. He examined the Cul-de-Sac Genrot; there he was cut off. He examined the Rue Petit-Picpus; there stood a sentinel. He saw that black form standing out in relief against the white pavement, illuminated by the moon; to advance was to fall into this man‚Äôs hands; to retreat was to fling himself into Javert‚Äôs arms. Jean Valjean felt himself caught, as in a net, which was slowly contracting; he gazed heavenward in despair.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîTHE GROPINGS OF FLIGHT
U||In order to understand what follows, it is requisite to form an exact idea of the Droit-Mur lane, and, in particular, of the angle which one leaves on the left when one emerges from the Rue Polonceau into this lane. Droit-Mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right, as far as the Rue Petit-Picpus, by houses of mean aspect; on the left by a solitary building of severe outlines, composed of numerous parts which grew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the Rue Petit-Picpus side; so that this building, which was very lofty on the Rue Petit-Picpus side, was tolerably low on the side adjoining the Rue Polonceau. There, at the angle of which we have spoken, it descended to such a degree that it consisted of merely a wall. This wall did not abut directly on the street; it formed a deeply retreating niche, concealed by its two corners from two observers who might have been, one in the Rue Polonceau, the other in the Rue Droit-Mur.
U||Beginning with these angles of the niche, the wall extended along the Rue Polonceau as far as a house which bore the number 49, and along the Rue Droit-Mur, where the fragment was much shorter, as far as the gloomy building which we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected, thus forming another retreating angle in the street. This gable was sombre of aspect; only one window was visible, or, to speak more correctly, two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed.
U||The state of the places of which we are here giving a description is rigorously exact, and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in the mind of old inhabitants of the quarter.
U||The niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal and wretched door; it was a vast, formless assemblage of perpendicular planks, the upper ones being broader than the lower, bound together by long transverse strips of iron. At one side there was a carriage gate of the ordinary dimensions, and which had evidently not been cut more than fifty years previously.
U||A linden-tree showed its crest above the niche, and the wall was covered with ivy on the side of the Rue Polonceau.
U||In the imminent peril in which Jean Valjean found himself, this sombre building had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted him. He ran his eyes rapidly over it; he said to himself, that if he could contrive to get inside it, he might save himself. First he conceived an idea, then a hope.
U||In the central portion of the front of this building, on the Rue Droit-Mur side, there were at all the windows of the different stories ancient cistern pipes of lead. The various branches of the pipes which led from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a sort of tree on the front. These ramifications of pipes with their hundred elbows imitated those old leafless vine-stocks which writhe over the fronts of old farm-houses.
U||This odd espalier, with its branches of lead and iron, was the first thing that struck Jean Valjean. He seated Cosette with her back against a stone post, with an injunction to be silent, and ran to the spot where the conduit touched the pavement. Perhaps there was some way of climbing up by it and entering the house. But the pipe was dilapidated and past service, and hardly hung to its fastenings. Moreover, all the windows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars, even the attic windows in the roof. And then, the moon fell full upon that fa√ßade, and the man who was watching at the corner of the street would have seen Jean Valjean in the act of climbing. And finally, what was to be done with Cosette? How was she to be drawn up to the top of a three-story house?
U||He gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain-pipe, and crawled along the wall to get back into the Rue Polonceau.
U||When he reached the slant of the wall where he had left Cosette, he noticed that no one could see him there. As we have just explained, he was concealed from all eyes, no matter from which direction they were approaching; besides this, he was in the shadow. Finally, there were two doors; perhaps they might be forced. The wall above which he saw the linden-tree and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he could, at least, hide himself, although there were as yet no leaves on the trees, and spend the remainder of the night.
U||Time was passing; he must act quickly.
U||He felt over the carriage door, and immediately recognized the fact that it was impracticable outside and in.
U||He approached the other door with more hope; it was frightfully decrepit; its very immensity rendered it less solid; the planks were rotten; the iron bands‚Äîthere were only three of them‚Äîwere rusted. It seemed as though it might be possible to pierce this worm-eaten barrier.
U||On examining it he found that the door was not a door; it had neither hinges, cross-bars, lock, nor fissure in the middle; the iron bands traversed it from side to side without any break. Through the crevices in the planks he caught a view of unhewn slabs and blocks of stone roughly cemented together, which passers-by might still have seen there ten years ago. He was forced to acknowledge with consternation that this apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building against which it was placed. It was easy to tear off a plank; but then, one found one‚Äôs self face to face with a wall.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîWHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH GAS LANTERNS
U||At that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at some distance. Jean Valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street. Seven or eight soldiers, drawn up in a platoon, had just debouched into the Rue Polonceau. He saw the gleam of their bayonets. They were advancing towards him; these soldiers, at whose head he distinguished Javert‚Äôs tall figure, advanced slowly and cautiously. They halted frequently; it was plain that they were searching all the nooks of the walls and all the embrasures of the doors and alleys.
U||This was some patrol that Javert had encountered‚Äîthere could be no mistake as to this surmise‚Äîand whose aid he had demanded.
U||Javert‚Äôs two acolytes were marching in their ranks.
U||At the rate at which they were marching, and in consideration of the halts which they were making, it would take them about a quarter of an hour to reach the spot where Jean Valjean stood. It was a frightful moment. A few minutes only separated Jean Valjean from that terrible precipice which yawned before him for the third time. And the galleys now meant not only the galleys, but Cosette lost to him forever; that is to say, a life resembling the interior of a tomb.
U||There was but one thing which was possible.
U||Jean Valjean had this peculiarity, that he carried, as one might say, two beggar‚Äôs pouches: in one he kept his saintly thoughts; in the other the redoubtable talents of a convict. He rummaged in the one or the other, according to circumstances.
U||Among his other resources, thanks to his numerous escapes from the prison at Toulon, he was, as it will be remembered, a past master in the incredible art of crawling up without ladder or climbing-irons, by sheer muscular force, by leaning on the nape of his neck, his shoulders, his hips, and his knees, by helping himself on the rare projections of the stone, in the right angle of a wall, as high as the sixth story, if need be; an art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner of the wall of the Conciergerie of Paris by which Battemolle, condemned to death, made his escape twenty years ago.
U||Jean Valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the linden; it was about eighteen feet in height. The angle which it formed with the gable of the large building was filled, at its lower extremity, by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape, probably intended to preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty creatures called the passers-by. This practice of filling up corners of the wall is much in use in Paris.
U||This mass was about five feet in height; the space above the summit of this mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteen feet.
U||The wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping.
U||Cosette was the difficulty, for she did not know how to climb a wall. Should he abandon her? Jean Valjean did not once think of that. It was impossible to carry her. A man‚Äôs whole strength is required to successfully carry out these singular ascents. The least burden would disturb his centre of gravity and pull him downwards.
U||A rope would have been required; Jean Valjean had none. Where was he to get a rope at midnight, in the Rue Polonceau? Certainly, if Jean Valjean had had a kingdom, he would have given it for a rope at that moment.
U||All extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes dazzle, sometimes illuminate us.
U||Jean Valjean‚Äôs despairing glance fell on the street lantern-post of the blind alley Genrot.
U||At that epoch there were no gas-jets in the streets of Paris. At nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted; they were ascended and descended by means of a rope, which traversed the street from side to side, and was adjusted in a groove of the post. The pulley over which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little iron box, the key to which was kept by the lamp-lighter, and the rope itself was protected by a metal case.
U||Jean Valjean, with the energy of a supreme struggle, crossed the street at one bound, entered the blind alley, broke the latch of the little box with the point of his knife, and an instant later he was beside Cosette once more. He had a rope. These gloomy inventors of expedients work rapidly when they are fighting against fatality.
U||We have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that night. The lantern in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot was thus naturally extinct, like the rest; and one could pass directly under it without even noticing that it was no longer in its place.
U||Nevertheless, the hour, the place, the darkness, Jean Valjean‚Äôs absorption, his singular gestures, his goings and comings, all had begun to render Cosette uneasy. Any other child than she would have given vent to loud shrieks long before. She contented herself with plucking Jean Valjean by the skirt of his coat. They could hear the sound of the patrol‚Äôs approach ever more and more distinctly.
U||‚ÄúFather,‚Äù said she, in a very low voice, ‚ÄúI am afraid. Who is coming yonder?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHush!‚Äù replied the unhappy man; ‚Äúit is Madame Th√©nardier.‚Äù
U||Cosette shuddered. He added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSay nothing. Don‚Äôt interfere with me. If you cry out, if you weep, the Th√©nardier is lying in wait for you. She is coming to take you back.‚Äù
U||Then, without haste, but without making a useless movement, with firm and curt precision, the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and Javert might come upon him at any moment, he undid his cravat, passed it round Cosette‚Äôs body under the armpits, taking care that it should not hurt the child, fastened this cravat to one end of the rope, by means of that knot which seafaring men call a ‚Äúswallow knot,‚Äù took the other end of the rope in his teeth, pulled off his shoes and stockings, which he threw over the wall, stepped upon the mass of masonry, and began to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with as much solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder under his feet and elbows. Half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting on his knees on the wall.
U||Cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement, without uttering a word. Jean Valjean‚Äôs injunction, and the name of Madame Th√©nardier, had chilled her blood.
U||All at once she heard Jean Valjean‚Äôs voice crying to her, though in a very low tone:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúPut your back against the wall.‚Äù
U||She obeyed.
U||‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say a word, and don‚Äôt be alarmed,‚Äù went on Jean Valjean.
U||And she felt herself lifted from the ground.
U||Before she had time to recover herself, she was on the top of the wall.
U||Jean Valjean grasped her, put her on his back, took her two tiny hands in his large left hand, lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along on top of the wall as far as the cant. As he had guessed, there stood a building whose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade and descended to within a very short distance of the ground, with a gentle slope which grazed the linden-tree. A lucky circumstance, for the wall was much higher on this side than on the street side. Jean Valjean could only see the ground at a great depth below him.
U||He had just reached the slope of the roof, and had not yet left the crest of the wall, when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the patrol. The thundering voice of Javert was audible:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSearch the blind alley! The Rue Droit-Mur is guarded! so is the Rue Petit-Picpus. I‚Äôll answer for it that he is in the blind alley.‚Äù
U||The soldiers rushed into the Genrot alley.
U||Jean Valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof, still holding fast to Cosette, reached the linden-tree, and leaped to the ground. Whether from terror or courage, Cosette had not breathed a sound, though her hands were a little abraded.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîTHE BEGINNING OF AN ENIGMA
U||Jean Valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast and of singular aspect; one of those melancholy gardens which seem made to be looked at in winter and at night. This garden was oblong in shape, with an alley of large poplars at the further end, tolerably tall forest trees in the corners, and an unshaded space in the centre, where could be seen a very large, solitary tree, then several fruit-trees, gnarled and bristling like bushes, beds of vegetables, a melon patch, whose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight, and an old well. Here and there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss. The alleys were bordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs. The grass had half taken possession of them, and a green mould covered the rest.
U||Jean Valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as a means of descent, a pile of fagots, and, behind the fagots, directly against the wall, a stone statue, whose mutilated face was no longer anything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the gloom.
U||The building was a sort of ruin, where dismantled chambers were distinguishable, one of which, much encumbered, seemed to serve as a shed.
U||The large building of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had a wing on the Rue Petit-Picpus, turned two fa√ßades, at right angles, towards this garden. These interior fa√ßades were even more tragic than the exterior. All the windows were grated. Not a gleam of light was visible at any one of them. The upper story had scuttles like prisons. One of those fa√ßades cast its shadow on the other, which fell over the garden like an immense black pall.
U||No other house was visible. The bottom of the garden was lost in mist and darkness. Nevertheless, walls could be confusedly made out, which intersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond, and the low roofs of the Rue Polonceau.
U||Nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined. There was no one in it, which was quite natural in view of the hour; but it did not seem as though this spot were made for any one to walk in, even in broad daylight.
U||Jean Valjean‚Äôs first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put them on again, then to step under the shed with Cosette. A man who is fleeing never thinks himself sufficiently hidden. The child, whose thoughts were still on the Th√©nardier, shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight as much as possible.
U||Cosette trembled and pressed close to him. They heard the tumultuous noise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets; the blows of their gun-stocks against the stones; Javert‚Äôs appeals to the police spies whom he had posted, and his imprecations mingled with words which could not be distinguished.
U||At the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that species of stormy roar were becoming more distant. Jean Valjean held his breath.
U||He had laid his hand lightly on Cosette‚Äôs mouth.
U||However, the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm, that this frightful uproar, close and furious as it was, did not disturb him by so much as the shadow of a misgiving. It seemed as though those walls had been built of the deaf stones of which the Scriptures speak.
U||All at once, in the midst of this profound calm, a fresh sound arose; a sound as celestial, divine, ineffable, ravishing, as the other had been horrible. It was a hymn which issued from the gloom, a dazzling burst of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night; women‚Äôs voices, but voices composed at one and the same time of the pure accents of virgins and the innocent accents of children,‚Äîvoices which are not of the earth, and which resemble those that the newborn infant still hears, and which the dying man hears already. This song proceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden. At the moment when the hubbub of demons retreated, one would have said that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom.
U||Cosette and Jean Valjean fell on their knees.
U||They knew not what it was, they knew not where they were; but both of them, the man and the child, the penitent and the innocent, felt that they must kneel.
U||These voices had this strange characteristic, that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted. It was a supernatural chant in an uninhabited house.
U||While these voices were singing, Jean Valjean thought of nothing. He no longer beheld the night; he beheld a blue sky. It seemed to him that he felt those wings which we all have within us, unfolding.
U||The song died away. It may have lasted a long time. Jean Valjean could not have told. Hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment.
U||All fell silent again. There was no longer anything in the street; there was nothing in the garden. That which had menaced, that which had reassured him,‚Äîall had vanished. The breeze swayed a few dry weeds on the crest of the wall, and they gave out a faint, sweet, melancholy sound.
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîCONTINUATION OF THE ENIGMA
U||The night wind had risen, which indicated that it must be between one and two o‚Äôclock in the morning. Poor Cosette said nothing. As she had seated herself beside him and leaned her head against him, Jean Valjean had fancied that she was asleep. He bent down and looked at her. Cosette‚Äôs eyes were wide open, and her thoughtful air pained Jean Valjean.
U||She was still trembling.
U||‚ÄúAre you sleepy?‚Äù said Jean Valjean.
U||‚ÄúI am very cold,‚Äù she replied.
U||A moment later she resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIs she still there?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWho?‚Äù said Jean Valjean.
U||‚ÄúMadame Th√©nardier.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed to make Cosette keep silent.
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù said he, ‚Äúshe is gone. You need fear nothing further.‚Äù
U||The child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast.
U||The ground was damp, the shed open on all sides, the breeze grew more keen every instant. The goodman took off his coat and wrapped it round Cosette.
U||‚ÄúAre you less cold now?‚Äù said he.
U||‚ÄúOh, yes, father.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell, wait for me a moment. I will soon be back.‚Äù
U||He quitted the ruin and crept along the large building, seeking a better shelter. He came across doors, but they were closed. There were bars at all the windows of the ground floor.
U||Just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice, he observed that he was coming to some arched windows, where he perceived a light. He stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows. They all opened on a tolerably vast hall, paved with large flagstones, cut up by arcades and pillars, where only a tiny light and great shadows were visible. The light came from a taper which was burning in one corner. The apartment was deserted, and nothing was stirring in it. Nevertheless, by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived on the ground something which appeared to be covered with a winding-sheet, and which resembled a human form. This form was lying face downward, flat on the pavement, with the arms extended in the form of a cross, in the immobility of death. One would have said, judging from a sort of serpent which undulated over the floor, that this sinister form had a rope round its neck.
U||The whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparely illuminated, which adds to horror.
U||Jean Valjean often said afterwards, that, although many funereal spectres had crossed his path in life, he had never beheld anything more blood-curdling and terrible than that enigmatical form accomplishing some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place, and beheld thus at night. It was alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead; and still more alarming to think that it was perhaps alive.
U||He had the courage to plaster his face to the glass, and to watch whether the thing would move. In spite of his remaining thus what seemed to him a very long time, the outstretched form made no movement. All at once he felt himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror, and he fled. He began to run towards the shed, not daring to look behind him. It seemed to him, that if he turned his head, he should see that form following him with great strides and waving its arms.
U||He reached the ruin all out of breath. His knees were giving way beneath him; the perspiration was pouring from him.
U||Where was he? Who could ever have imagined anything like that sort of sepulchre in the midst of Paris! What was this strange house? An edifice full of nocturnal mystery, calling to souls through the darkness with the voice of angels, and when they came, offering them abruptly that terrible vision; promising to open the radiant portals of heaven, and then opening the horrible gates of the tomb! And it actually was an edifice, a house, which bore a number on the street! It was not a dream! He had to touch the stones to convince himself that such was the fact.
U||Cold, anxiety, uneasiness, the emotions of the night, had given him a genuine fever, and all these ideas were clashing together in his brain.
U||He stepped up to Cosette. She was asleep.
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîTHE ENIGMA BECOMES DOUBLY MYSTERIOUS
U||The child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep.
U||He sat down beside her and began to think. Little by little, as he gazed at her, he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom of mind.
U||He clearly perceived this truth, the foundation of his life henceforth, that so long as she was there, so long as he had her near him, he should need nothing except for her, he should fear nothing except for her. He was not even conscious that he was very cold, since he had taken off his coat to cover her.
U||Nevertheless, athwart this reverie into which he had fallen he had heard for some time a peculiar noise. It was like the tinkling of a bell. This sound proceeded from the garden. It could be heard distinctly though faintly. It resembled the faint, vague music produced by the bells of cattle at night in the pastures.
U||This noise made Valjean turn round.
U||He looked and saw that there was some one in the garden.
U||A being resembling a man was walking amid the bell-glasses of the melon beds, rising, stooping, halting, with regular movements, as though he were dragging or spreading out something on the ground. This person appeared to limp.
U||Jean Valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy. For them everything is hostile and suspicious. They distrust the day because it enables people to see them, and the night because it aids in surprising them. A little while before he had shivered because the garden was deserted, and now he shivered because there was some one there.
U||He fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors. He said to himself that Javert and the spies had, perhaps, not taken their departure; that they had, no doubt, left people on the watch in the street; that if this man should discover him in the garden, he would cry out for help against thieves and deliver him up. He took the sleeping Cosette gently in his arms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture, which was out of use, in the most remote corner of the shed. Cosette did not stir.
U||From that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melon patch. The strange thing about it was, that the sound of the bell followed each of this man‚Äôs movements. When the man approached, the sound approached; when the man retreated, the sound retreated; if he made any hasty gesture, a tremolo accompanied the gesture; when he halted, the sound ceased. It appeared evident that the bell was attached to that man; but what could that signify? Who was this man who had a bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox?
U||As he put these questions to himself, he touched Cosette‚Äôs hands. They were icy cold.
U||‚ÄúAh! good God!‚Äù he cried.
U||He spoke to her in a low voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCosette!‚Äù
U||She did not open her eyes.
U||He shook her vigorously.
U||She did not wake.
U||‚ÄúIs she dead?‚Äù he said to himself, and sprang to his feet, quivering from head to foot.
U||The most frightful thoughts rushed pell-mell through his mind. There are moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies, and violently force the partitions of our brains. When those we love are in question, our prudence invents every sort of madness. He remembered that sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal.
U||Cosette was pale, and had fallen at full length on the ground at his feet, without a movement.
U||He listened to her breathing: she still breathed, but with a respiration which seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction.
U||How was he to warm her back to life? How was he to rouse her? All that was not connected with this vanished from his thoughts. He rushed wildly from the ruin.
U||It was absolutely necessary that Cosette should be in bed and beside a fire in less than a quarter of an hour.
U||CHAPTER IX‚ÄîTHE MAN WITH THE BELL
U||He walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden. He had taken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat.
U||The man‚Äôs head was bent down, and he did not see him approaching. In a few strides Jean Valjean stood beside him.
U||Jean Valjean accosted him with the cry:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúOne hundred francs!‚Äù
U||The man gave a start and raised his eyes.
U||‚ÄúYou can earn a hundred francs,‚Äù went on Jean Valjean, ‚Äúif you will grant me shelter for this night.‚Äù
U||The moon shone full upon Jean Valjean‚Äôs terrified countenance.
U||‚ÄúWhat! so it is you, Father Madeleine!‚Äù said the man.
U||That name, thus pronounced, at that obscure hour, in that unknown spot, by that strange man, made Jean Valjean start back.
U||He had expected anything but that. The person who thus addressed him was a bent and lame old man, dressed almost like a peasant, who wore on his left knee a leather knee-cap, whence hung a moderately large bell. His face, which was in the shadow, was not distinguishable.
U||However, the goodman had removed his cap, and exclaimed, trembling all over:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAh, good God! How come you here, Father Madeleine? Where did you enter? Dieu-J√©sus! Did you fall from heaven? There is no trouble about that: if ever you do fall, it will be from there. And what a state you are in! You have no cravat; you have no hat; you have no coat! Do you know, you would have frightened any one who did not know you? No coat! Lord God! Are the saints going mad nowadays? But how did you get in here?‚Äù
U||His words tumbled over each other. The goodman talked with a rustic volubility, in which there was nothing alarming. All this was uttered with a mixture of stupefaction and na√Øve kindliness.
U||‚ÄúWho are you? and what house is this?‚Äù demanded Jean Valjean.
U||‚ÄúAh! pardieu, this is too much!‚Äù exclaimed the old man. ‚ÄúI am the person for whom you got the place here, and this house is the one where you had me placed. What! You don‚Äôt recognize me?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Jean Valjean; ‚Äúand how happens it that you know me?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou saved my life,‚Äù said the man.
U||He turned. A ray of moonlight outlined his profile, and Jean Valjean recognized old Fauchelevent.
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù said Jean Valjean, ‚Äúso it is you? Yes, I recollect you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is very lucky,‚Äù said the old man, in a reproachful tone.
U||‚ÄúAnd what are you doing here?‚Äù resumed Jean Valjean.
U||‚ÄúWhy, I am covering my melons, of course!‚Äù
U||In fact, at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him, old Fauchelevent held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in spreading over the melon bed. During the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them. It was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by Jean Valjean.
U||He continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI said to myself, ‚ÄòThe moon is bright: it is going to freeze. What if I were to put my melons into their greatcoats?‚Äô And,‚Äù he added, looking at Jean Valjean with a broad smile,‚Äî‚Äúpardieu! you ought to have done the same! But how do you come here?‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean, finding himself known to this man, at least only under the name of Madeleine, thenceforth advanced only with caution. He multiplied his questions. Strange to say, their r√¥les seemed to be reversed. It was he, the intruder, who interrogated.
U||‚ÄúAnd what is this bell which you wear on your knee?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThis,‚Äù replied Fauchelevent, ‚Äúis so that I may be avoided.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat! so that you may be avoided?‚Äù
U||Old Fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air.
U||‚ÄúAh, goodness! there are only women in this house‚Äîmany young girls. It appears that I should be a dangerous person to meet. The bell gives them warning. When I come, they go.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat house is this?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCome, you know well enough.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut I do not.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNot when you got me the place here as gardener?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnswer me as though I knew nothing.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell, then, this is the Petit-Picpus convent.‚Äù
U||Memories recurred to Jean Valjean. Chance, that is to say, Providence, had cast him into precisely that convent in the Quartier Saint-Antoine where old Fauchelevent, crippled by the fall from his cart, had been admitted on his recommendation two years previously. He repeated, as though talking to himself:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe Petit-Picpus convent.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù returned old Fauchelevent. ‚ÄúBut to come to the point, how the deuce did you manage to get in here, you, Father Madeleine? No matter if you are a saint; you are a man as well, and no man enters here.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou certainly are here.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThere is no one but me.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúStill,‚Äù said Jean Valjean, ‚ÄúI must stay here.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh, good God!‚Äù cried Fauchelevent.
U||Jean Valjean drew near to the old man, and said to him in a grave voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFather Fauchelevent, I saved your life.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI was the first to recall it,‚Äù returned Fauchelevent.
U||‚ÄúWell, you can do to-day for me that which I did for you in the olden days.‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent took in his aged, trembling, and wrinkled hands Jean Valjean‚Äôs two robust hands, and stood for several minutes as though incapable of speaking. At length he exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúOh! that would be a blessing from the good God, if I could make you some little return for that! Save your life! Monsieur le Maire, dispose of the old man!‚Äù
U||A wonderful joy had transfigured this old man. His countenance seemed to emit a ray of light.
U||‚ÄúWhat do you wish me to do?‚Äù he resumed.
U||‚ÄúThat I will explain to you. You have a chamber?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have an isolated hovel yonder, behind the ruins of the old convent, in a corner which no one ever looks into. There are three rooms in it.‚Äù
U||The hut was, in fact, so well hidden behind the ruins, and so cleverly arranged to prevent it being seen, that Jean Valjean had not perceived it.
U||‚ÄúGood,‚Äù said Jean Valjean. ‚ÄúNow I am going to ask two things of you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat are they, Mr. Mayor?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn the first place, you are not to tell any one what you know about me. In the second, you are not to try to find out anything more.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAs you please. I know that you can do nothing that is not honest, that you have always been a man after the good God‚Äôs heart. And then, moreover, you it was who placed me here. That concerns you. I am at your service.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is settled then. Now, come with me. We will go and get the child.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù said Fauchelevent, ‚Äúso there is a child?‚Äù
U||He added not a word further, and followed Jean Valjean as a dog follows his master.
U||Less than half an hour afterwards Cosette, who had grown rosy again before the flame of a good fire, was lying asleep in the old gardener‚Äôs bed. Jean Valjean had put on his cravat and coat once more; his hat, which he had flung over the wall, had been found and picked up. While Jean Valjean was putting on his coat, Fauchelevent had removed the bell and kneecap, which now hung on a nail beside a vintage basket that adorned the wall. The two men were warming themselves with their elbows resting on a table upon which Fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese, black bread, a bottle of wine, and two glasses, and the old man was saying to Jean Valjean, as he laid his hand on the latter‚Äôs knee: ‚ÄúAh! Father Madeleine! You did not recognize me immediately; you save people‚Äôs lives, and then you forget them! That is bad! But they remember you! You are an ingrate!‚Äù
U||CHAPTER X‚ÄîWHICH EXPLAINS HOW JAVERT GOT ON THE SCENT
U||The events of which we have just beheld the reverse side, so to speak, had come about in the simplest possible manner.
U||When Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert had arrested him beside Fantine‚Äôs death-bed, had escaped from the town jail of M. sur M., the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to Paris. Paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost, and everything disappears in this belly of the world, as in the belly of the sea. No forest hides a man as does that crowd. Fugitives of every sort know this. They go to Paris as to an abyss; there are gulfs which save. The police know it also, and it is in Paris that they seek what they have lost elsewhere. They sought the ex-mayor of M. sur M. Javert was summoned to Paris to throw light on their researches. Javert had, in fact, rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of Jean Valjean. Javert‚Äôs zeal and intelligence on that occasion had been remarked by M. Chabouillet, secretary of the Prefecture under Comte Angl√®s. M. Chabouillet, who had, moreover, already been Javert‚Äôs patron, had the inspector of M. sur M. attached to the police force 
U||of Paris. There Javert rendered himself useful in divers and, though the word may seem strange for such services, honorable manners.
U||He no longer thought of Jean Valjean,‚Äîthe wolf of to-day causes these dogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday,‚Äîwhen, in December, 1823, he read a newspaper, he who never read newspapers; but Javert, a monarchical man, had a desire to know the particulars of the triumphal entry of the ‚ÄúPrince Generalissimo‚Äù into Bayonne. Just as he was finishing the article, which interested him; a name, the name of Jean Valjean, attracted his attention at the bottom of a page. The paper announced that the convict Jean Valjean was dead, and published the fact in such formal terms that Javert did not doubt it. He confined himself to the remark, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good entry.‚Äù Then he threw aside the paper, and thought no more about it.
U||Some time afterwards, it chanced that a police report was transmitted from the prefecture of the Seine-et-Oise to the prefecture of police in Paris, concerning the abduction of a child, which had taken place, under peculiar circumstances, as it was said, in the commune of Montfermeil. A little girl of seven or eight years of age, the report said, who had been intrusted by her mother to an inn-keeper of that neighborhood, had been stolen by a stranger; this child answered to the name of Cosette, and was the daughter of a girl named Fantine, who had died in the hospital, it was not known where or when.
U||This report came under Javert‚Äôs eye and set him to thinking.
U||The name of Fantine was well known to him. He remembered that Jean Valjean had made him, Javert, burst into laughter, by asking him for a respite of three days, for the purpose of going to fetch that creature‚Äôs child. He recalled the fact that Jean Valjean had been arrested in Paris at the very moment when he was stepping into the coach for Montfermeil. Some signs had made him suspect at the time that this was the second occasion of his entering that coach, and that he had already, on the previous day, made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village, for he had not been seen in the village itself. What had he been intending to do in that region of Montfermeil? It could not even be surmised. Javert understood it now. Fantine‚Äôs daughter was there. Jean Valjean was going there in search of her. And now this child had been stolen by a stranger! Who could that stranger be? Could it be Jean Valjean? But Jean Valjean was dead. Javert, without saying anything to anybody, took the coach from the Pewter Plat
U||ter, Cul-de-Sac de la Planchette, and made a trip to Montfermeil.
U||He expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there; he found a great deal of obscurity.
U||For the first few days the Th√©nardiers had chattered in their rage. The disappearance of the Lark had created a sensation in the village. He immediately obtained numerous versions of the story, which ended in the abduction of a child. Hence the police report. But their first vexation having passed off, Th√©nardier, with his wonderful instinct, had very quickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up the prosecutor of the Crown, and that his complaints with regard to the abduction of Cosette would have as their first result to fix upon himself, and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand, the glittering eye of justice. The last thing that owls desire is to have a candle brought to them. And in the first place, how explain the fifteen hundred francs which he had received? He turned squarely round, put a gag on his wife‚Äôs mouth, and feigned astonishment when the stolen child was mentioned to him. He understood nothing about it; no doubt he had grumbled for awhile at having that dear little cre
U||ature ‚Äútaken from him‚Äù so hastily; he should have liked to keep her two or three days longer, out of tenderness; but her ‚Äúgrandfather‚Äù had come for her in the most natural way in the world. He added the ‚Äúgrandfather,‚Äù which produced a good effect. This was the story that Javert hit upon when he arrived at Montfermeil. The grandfather caused Jean Valjean to vanish.
U||Nevertheless, Javert dropped a few questions, like plummets, into Th√©nardier‚Äôs history. ‚ÄúWho was that grandfather? and what was his name?‚Äù Th√©nardier replied with simplicity: ‚ÄúHe is a wealthy farmer. I saw his passport. I think his name was M. Guillaume Lambert.‚Äù
U||Lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name. Thereupon Javert returned to Paris.
U||‚ÄúJean Valjean is certainly dead,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúand I am a ninny.‚Äù
U||He had again begun to forget this history, when, in the course of March, 1824, he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish of Saint-M√©dard and who had been surnamed ‚Äúthe mendicant who gives alms.‚Äù This person, the story ran, was a man of means, whose name no one knew exactly, and who lived alone with a little girl of eight years, who knew nothing about herself, save that she had come from Montfermeil. Montfermeil! that name was always coming up, and it made Javert prick up his ears. An old beggar police spy, an ex-beadle, to whom this person had given alms, added a few more details. This gentleman of property was very shy,‚Äînever coming out except in the evening, speaking to no one, except, occasionally to the poor, and never allowing any one to approach him. He wore a horrible old yellow frock-coat, which was worth many millions, being all wadded with bank-bills. This piqued Javert‚Äôs curiosity in a decided manner. In order to get a close look at this fantastic gentleman without alarming
U|| him, he borrowed the beadle‚Äôs outfit for a day, and the place where the old spy was in the habit of crouching every evening, whining orisons through his nose, and playing the spy under cover of prayer.
U||‚ÄúThe suspected individual‚Äù did indeed approach Javert thus disguised, and bestow alms on him. At that moment Javert raised his head, and the shock which Jean Valjean received on recognizing Javert was equal to the one received by Javert when he thought he recognized Jean Valjean.
U||However, the darkness might have misled him; Jean Valjean‚Äôs death was official; Javert cherished very grave doubts; and when in doubt, Javert, the man of scruples, never laid a finger on any one‚Äôs collar.
U||He followed his man to the Gorbeau house, and got ‚Äúthe old woman‚Äù to talking, which was no difficult matter. The old woman confirmed the fact regarding the coat lined with millions, and narrated to him the episode of the thousand-franc bill. She had seen it! She had handled it! Javert hired a room; that evening he installed himself in it. He came and listened at the mysterious lodger‚Äôs door, hoping to catch the sound of his voice, but Jean Valjean saw his candle through the key-hole, and foiled the spy by keeping silent.
U||On the following day Jean Valjean decamped; but the noise made by the fall of the five-franc piece was noticed by the old woman, who, hearing the rattling of coin, suspected that he might be intending to leave, and made haste to warn Javert. At night, when Jean Valjean came out, Javert was waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men.
U||Javert had demanded assistance at the Prefecture, but he had not mentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize; that was his secret, and he had kept it for three reasons: in the first place, because the slightest indiscretion might put Jean Valjean on the alert; next, because, to lay hands on an ex-convict who had made his escape and was reputed dead, on a criminal whom justice had formerly classed forever as among malefactors of the most dangerous sort, was a magnificent success which the old members of the Parisian police would assuredly not leave to a newcomer like Javert, and he was afraid of being deprived of his convict; and lastly, because Javert, being an artist, had a taste for the unforeseen. He hated those well-heralded successes which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloom brushed off. He preferred to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark and to unveil them suddenly at the last.
U||Javert had followed Jean Valjean from tree to tree, then from corner to corner of the street, and had not lost sight of him for a single instant; even at the moments when Jean Valjean believed himself to be the most secure Javert‚Äôs eye had been on him. Why had not Javert arrested Jean Valjean? Because he was still in doubt.
U||It must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely at its ease; the free press embarrassed it; several arbitrary arrests denounced by the newspapers, had echoed even as far as the Chambers, and had rendered the Prefecture timid. Interference with individual liberty was a grave matter. The police agents were afraid of making a mistake; the prefect laid the blame on them; a mistake meant dismissal. The reader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph, reproduced by twenty newspapers, would have caused in Paris: ‚ÄúYesterday, an aged grandfather, with white hair, a respectable and well-to-do gentleman, who was walking with his grandchild, aged eight, was arrested and conducted to the agency of the Prefecture as an escaped convict!‚Äù
U||Let us repeat in addition that Javert had scruples of his own; injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of the prefect. He was really in doubt.
U||Jean Valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark.
U||Sadness, uneasiness, anxiety, depression, this fresh misfortune of being forced to flee by night, to seek a chance refuge in Paris for Cosette and himself, the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of the child‚Äîall this, without his being aware of it, had altered Jean Valjean‚Äôs walk, and impressed on his bearing such senility, that the police themselves, incarnate in the person of Javert, might, and did in fact, make a mistake. The impossibility of approaching too close, his costume of an √©migr√© preceptor, the declaration of Th√©nardier which made a grandfather of him, and, finally, the belief in his death in prison, added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in Javert‚Äôs mind.
U||For an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his papers; but if the man was not Jean Valjean, and if this man was not a good, honest old fellow living on his income, he was probably some merry blade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of Parisian misdeeds, some chief of a dangerous band, who gave alms to conceal his other talents, which was an old dodge. He had trusty fellows, accomplices‚Äô retreats in case of emergencies, in which he would, no doubt, take refuge. All these turns which he was making through the streets seemed to indicate that he was not a simple and honest man. To arrest him too hastily would be ‚Äúto kill the hen that laid the golden eggs.‚Äù Where was the inconvenience in waiting? Javert was very sure that he would not escape.
U||Thus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind, putting to himself a hundred questions about this enigmatical personage.
U||It was only quite late in the Rue de Pontoise, that, thanks to the brilliant light thrown from a dram-shop, he decidedly recognized Jean Valjean.
U||There are in this world two beings who give a profound start,‚Äîthe mother who recovers her child and the tiger who recovers his prey. Javert gave that profound start.
U||As soon as he had positively recognized Jean Valjean, the formidable convict, he perceived that there were only three of them, and he asked for reinforcements at the police station of the Rue de Pontoise. One puts on gloves before grasping a thorn cudgel.
U||This delay and the halt at the Carrefour Rollin to consult with his agents came near causing him to lose the trail. He speedily divined, however, that Jean Valjean would want to put the river between his pursuers and himself. He bent his head and reflected like a blood-hound who puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right scent. Javert, with his powerful rectitude of instinct, went straight to the bridge of Austerlitz. A word with the toll-keeper furnished him with the information which he required: ‚ÄúHave you seen a man with a little girl?‚Äù ‚ÄúI made him pay two sous,‚Äù replied the toll-keeper. Javert reached the bridge in season to see Jean Valjean traverse the small illuminated spot on the other side of the water, leading Cosette by the hand. He saw him enter the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine; he remembered the Cul-de-Sac Genrot arranged there like a trap, and of the sole exit of the Rue Droit-Mur into the Rue Petit-Picpus. He made sure of his back burrows, as huntsmen say; he 
U||hastily despatched one of his agents, by a roundabout way, to guard that issue. A patrol which was returning to the Arsenal post having passed him, he made a requisition on it, and caused it to accompany him. In such games soldiers are aces. Moreover, the principle is, that in order to get the best of a wild boar, one must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs. These combinations having been effected, feeling that Jean Valjean was caught between the blind alley Genrot on the right, his agent on the left, and himself, Javert, in the rear, he took a pinch of snuff.
U||Then he began the game. He experienced one ecstatic and infernal moment; he allowed his man to go on ahead, knowing that he had him safe, but desirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long as possible, happy at the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him free, gloating over him with his gaze, with that voluptuousness of the spider which allows the fly to flutter, and of the cat which lets the mouse run. Claws and talons possess a monstrous sensuality,‚Äîthe obscure movements of the creature imprisoned in their pincers. What a delight this strangling is!
U||Javert was enjoying himself. The meshes of his net were stoutly knotted. He was sure of success; all he had to do now was to close his hand.
U||Accompanied as he was, the very idea of resistance was impossible, however vigorous, energetic, and desperate Jean Valjean might be.
U||Javert on the Hunt
U||Javert advanced slowly, sounding, searching on his way all the nooks of the street like so many pockets of thieves.
U||When he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there.
U||His exasperation can be imagined.
U||He interrogated his sentinel of the Rues Droit-Mur and Petit-Picpus; that agent, who had remained imperturbably at his post, had not seen the man pass.
U||It sometimes happens that a stag is lost head and horns; that is to say, he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels, and then the oldest huntsmen know not what to say. Duvivier, Ligniville, and Desprez halt short. In a discomfiture of this sort, Artonge exclaims, ‚ÄúIt was not a stag, but a sorcerer.‚Äù Javert would have liked to utter the same cry.
U||His disappointment bordered for a moment on despair and rage.
U||It is certain that Napoleon made mistakes during the war with Russia, that Alexander committed blunders in the war in India, that C√¶sar made mistakes in the war in Africa, that Cyrus was at fault in the war in Scythia, and that Javert blundered in this campaign against Jean Valjean. He was wrong, perhaps, in hesitating in his recognition of the exconvict. The first glance should have sufficed him. He was wrong in not arresting him purely and simply in the old building; he was wrong in not arresting him when he positively recognized him in the Rue de Pontoise. He was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the full light of the moon in the Carrefour Rollin. Advice is certainly useful; it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogs who deserve confidence; but the hunter cannot be too cautious when he is chasing uneasy animals like the wolf and the convict. Javert, by taking too much thought as to how he should set the bloodhounds of the pack on the trail, alarmed the beast by giving h
U||im wind of the dart, and so made him run. Above all, he was wrong in that after he had picked up the scent again on the bridge of Austerlitz, he played that formidable and puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread. He thought himself stronger than he was, and believed that he could play at the game of the mouse and the lion. At the same time, he reckoned himself as too weak, when he judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement. Fatal precaution, waste of precious time! Javert committed all these blunders, and nonetheless was one of the cleverest and most correct spies that ever existed. He was, in the full force of the term, what is called in venery a knowing dog. But what is there that is perfect?
U||Great strategists have their eclipses.
U||The greatest follies are often composed, like the largest ropes, of a multitude of strands. Take the cable thread by thread, take all the petty determining motives separately, and you can break them one after the other, and you say, ‚ÄúThat is all there is of it!‚Äù Braid them, twist them together; the result is enormous: it is Attila hesitating between Marcian on the east and Valentinian on the west; it is Hannibal tarrying at Capua; it is Danton falling asleep at Arcis-sur-Aube.
U||However that may be, even at the moment when he saw that Jean Valjean had escaped him, Javert did not lose his head. Sure that the convict who had broken his ban could not be far off, he established sentinels, he organized traps and ambuscades, and beat the quarter all that night. The first thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose rope had been cut. A precious sign which, however, led him astray, since it caused him to turn all his researches in the direction of the Cul-de-Sac Genrot. In this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abutted on gardens whose bounds adjoined the immense stretches of waste land. Jean Valjean evidently must have fled in that direction. The fact is, that had he penetrated a little further in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot, he would probably have done so and have been lost. Javert explored these gardens and these waste stretches as though he had been hunting for a needle.
U||At daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook, and returned to the Prefecture of Police, as much ashamed as a police spy who had been captured by a robber might have been.
U||BOOK SIXTH‚ÄîLE PETIT-PICPUS
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîNUMBER 62 RUE PETIT-PICPUS
U||Nothing, half a century ago, more resembled every other carriage gate than the carriage gate of Number 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. This entrance, which usually stood ajar in the most inviting fashion, permitted a view of two things, neither of which have anything very funereal about them,‚Äîa courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines, and the face of a lounging porter. Above the wall, at the bottom of the court, tall trees were visible. When a ray of sunlight enlivened the courtyard, when a glass of wine cheered up the porter, it was difficult to pass Number 62 Little Picpus Street without carrying away a smiling impression of it. Nevertheless, it was a sombre place of which one had had a glimpse.
U||The threshold smiled; the house prayed and wept.
U||If one succeeded in passing the porter, which was not easy,‚Äîwhich was even nearly impossible for every one, for there was an open sesame! which it was necessary to know,‚Äîif, the porter once passed, one entered a little vestibule on the right, on which opened a staircase shut in between two walls and so narrow that only one person could ascend it at a time, if one did not allow one‚Äôs self to be alarmed by a daubing of canary yellow, with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase, if one ventured to ascend it, one crossed a first landing, then a second, and arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow wash and the chocolate-hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable persistency. Staircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful windows. The corridor took a turn and became dark. If one doubled this cape, one arrived a few paces further on, in front of a door which was all the more mysterious because it was not fastened. If one opened it, one found one‚Äôs self in a little chamber abou
U||t six feet square, tiled, well-scrubbed, clean, cold, and hung with nankin paper with green flowers, at fifteen sous the roll. A white, dull light fell from a large window, with tiny panes, on the left, which usurped the whole width of the room. One gazed about, but saw no one; one listened, one heard neither a footstep nor a human murmur. The walls were bare, the chamber was not furnished; there was not even a chair.
U||One looked again, and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangular hole, about a foot square, with a grating of interlacing iron bars, black, knotted, solid, which formed squares‚ÄîI had almost said meshes‚Äîof less than an inch and a half in diagonal length. The little green flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to those iron bars, without being startled or thrown into confusion by their funereal contact. Supposing that a living being had been so wonderfully thin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the square hole, this grating would have prevented it. It did not allow the passage of the body, but it did allow the passage of the eyes; that is to say, of the mind. This seems to have occurred to them, for it had been re-enforced by a sheet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear, and pierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes of a strainer. At the bottom of this plate, an aperture had been pierced exactly similar to the orifice of a letter box. A 
U||bit of tape attached to a bell-wire hung at the right of the grated opening.
U||If the tape was pulled, a bell rang, and one heard a voice very near at hand, which made one start.
U||‚ÄúWho is there?‚Äù the voice demanded.
U||It was a woman‚Äôs voice, a gentle voice, so gentle that it was mournful.
U||Here, again, there was a magical word which it was necessary to know. If one did not know it, the voice ceased, the wall became silent once more, as though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on the other side of it.
U||If one knew the password, the voice resumed, ‚ÄúEnter on the right.‚Äù
U||One then perceived on the right, facing the window, a glass door surmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray. On raising the latch and crossing the threshold, one experienced precisely the same impression as when one enters at the theatre into a grated baignoire, before the grating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted. One was, in fact, in a sort of theatre-box, narrow, furnished with two old chairs, and a much-frayed straw matting, sparely illuminated by the vague light from the glass door; a regular box, with its front just of a height to lean upon, bearing a tablet of black wood. This box was grated, only the grating of it was not of gilded wood, as at the opera; it was a monstrous lattice of iron bars, hideously interlaced and riveted to the wall by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists.
U||The first minutes passed; when one‚Äôs eyes began to grow used to this cellar-like half-twilight, one tried to pass the grating, but got no further than six inches beyond it. There he encountered a barrier of black shutters, re-enforced and fortified with transverse beams of wood painted a gingerbread yellow. These shutters were divided into long, narrow slats, and they masked the entire length of the grating. They were always closed. At the expiration of a few moments one heard a voice proceeding from behind these shutters, and saying:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am here. What do you wish with me?‚Äù
U||It was a beloved, sometimes an adored, voice. No one was visible. Hardly the sound of a breath was audible. It seemed as though it were a spirit which had been evoked, that was speaking to you across the walls of the tomb.
U||If one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare conditions, the slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you; the evoked spirit became an apparition. Behind the grating, behind the shutter, one perceived so far as the grating permitted sight, a head, of which only the mouth and the chin were visible; the rest was covered with a black veil. One caught a glimpse of a black guimpe, and a form that was barely defined, covered with a black shroud. That head spoke with you, but did not look at you and never smiled at you.
U||The light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that you saw her in the white, and she saw you in the black. This light was symbolical.
U||Nevertheless, your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which was made in that place shut off from all glances. A profound vagueness enveloped that form clad in mourning. Your eyes searched that vagueness, and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition. At the expiration of a very short time you discovered that you could see nothing. What you beheld was night, emptiness, shadows, a wintry mist mingled with a vapor from the tomb, a sort of terrible peace, a silence from which you could gather nothing, not even sighs, a gloom in which you could distinguish nothing, not even phantoms.
U||What you beheld was the interior of a cloister.
U||It was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called the Convent of the Bernardines of the Perpetual Adoration. The box in which you stood was the parlor. The first voice which had addressed you was that of the portress who always sat motionless and silent, on the other side of the wall, near the square opening, screened by the iron grating and the plate with its thousand holes, as by a double visor. The obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact that the parlor, which had a window on the side of the world, had none on the side of the convent. Profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place.
U||Nevertheless, there was something beyond that shadow; there was a light; there was life in the midst of that death. Although this was the most strictly walled of all convents, we shall endeavor to make our way into it, and to take the reader in, and to say, without transgressing the proper bounds, things which story-tellers have never seen, and have, therefore, never described.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîTHE OBEDIENCE OF MARTIN VERGA
U||This convent, which in 1824 had already existed for many a long year in the Rue Petit-Picpus, was a community of Bernardines of the obedience of Martin Verga.
U||These Bernardines were attached, in consequence, not to Clairvaux, like the Bernardine monks, but to C√Æteaux, like the Benedictine monks. In other words, they were the subjects, not of Saint Bernard, but of Saint Beno√Æt.
U||Any one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that Martin Verga founded in 1425 a congregation of Bernardines-Benedictines, with Salamanca for the head of the order, and Alcala as the branch establishment.
U||This congregation had sent out branches throughout all the Catholic countries of Europe.
U||There is nothing unusual in the Latin Church in these grafts of one order on another. To mention only a single order of Saint-Beno√Æt, which is here in question: there are attached to this order, without counting the obedience of Martin Verga, four congregations,‚Äîtwo in Italy, Mont-Cassin and Sainte-Justine of Padua; two in France, Cluny and Saint-Maur; and nine orders,‚ÄîVallombrosa, Granmont, the C√©lestins, the Camaldules, the Carthusians, the Humili√©s, the Olivateurs, the Silvestrins, and lastly, C√Æteaux; for C√Æteaux itself, a trunk for other orders, is only an offshoot of Saint-Beno√Æt. C√Æteaux dates from Saint Robert, Abb√© de Molesme, in the diocese of Langres, in 1098. Now it was in 529 that the devil, having retired to the desert of Subiaco‚Äîhe was old‚Äîhad he turned hermit?‚Äîwas chased from the ancient temple of Apollo, where he dwelt, by Saint-Beno√Æt, then aged seventeen.
U||After the rule of the Carmelites, who go barefoot, wear a bit of willow on their throats, and never sit down, the harshest rule is that of the Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga. They are clothed in black, with a guimpe, which, in accordance with the express command of Saint-Beno√Æt, mounts to the chin. A robe of serge with large sleeves, a large woollen veil, the guimpe which mounts to the chin cut square on the breast, the band which descends over their brow to their eyes,‚Äîthis is their dress. All is black except the band, which is white. The novices wear the same habit, but all in white. The professed nuns also wear a rosary at their side.
U||The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga practise the Perpetual Adoration, like the Benedictines called Ladies of the Holy Sacrament, who, at the beginning of this century, had two houses in Paris,‚Äîone at the Temple, the other in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevi√®ve. However, the Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus, of whom we are speaking, were a totally different order from the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament, cloistered in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevi√®ve and at the Temple. There were numerous differences in their rule; there were some in their costume. The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus wore the black guimpe, and the Benedictines of the Holy Sacrament and of the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevi√®ve wore a white one, and had, besides, on their breasts, a Holy Sacrament about three inches long, in silver gilt or gilded copper. The nuns of the Petit-Picpus did not wear this Holy Sacrament. The Perpetual Adoration, which was common to the house of the Petit-Picpus and to the house of the Temple, l
U||eaves those two orders perfectly distinct. Their only resemblance lies in this practice of the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament and the Bernardines of Martin Verga, just as there existed a similarity in the study and the glorification of all the mysteries relating to the infancy, the life, and death of Jesus Christ and the Virgin, between the two orders, which were, nevertheless, widely separated, and on occasion even hostile. The Oratory of Italy, established at Florence by Philip de Neri, and the Oratory of France, established by Pierre de B√©rulle. The Oratory of France claimed the precedence, since Philip de Neri was only a saint, while B√©rulle was a cardinal.
U||Let us return to the harsh Spanish rule of Martin Verga.
U||The Bernardines-Benedictines of this obedience fast all the year round, abstain from meat, fast in Lent and on many other days which are peculiar to them, rise from their first sleep, from one to three o‚Äôclock in the morning, to read their breviary and chant matins, sleep in all seasons between serge sheets and on straw, make no use of the bath, never light a fire, scourge themselves every Friday, observe the rule of silence, speak to each other only during the recreation hours, which are very brief, and wear drugget chemises for six months in the year, from September 14th, which is the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, until Easter. These six months are a modification: the rule says all the year, but this drugget chemise, intolerable in the heat of summer, produced fevers and nervous spasms. The use of it had to be restricted. Even with this palliation, when the nuns put on this chemise on the 14th of September, they suffer from fever for three or four days. Obedience, poverty, chastity, perseverance in their
U|| seclusion,‚Äîthese are their vows, which the rule greatly aggravates.
U||The prioress is elected for three years by the mothers, who are called m√®res vocales because they have a voice in the chapter. A prioress can only be re-elected twice, which fixes the longest possible reign of a prioress at nine years.
U||They never see the officiating priest, who is always hidden from them by a serge curtain nine feet in height. During the sermon, when the preacher is in the chapel, they drop their veils over their faces. They must always speak low, walk with their eyes on the ground and their heads bowed. One man only is allowed to enter the convent,‚Äîthe archbishop of the diocese.
U||There is really one other,‚Äîthe gardener. But he is always an old man, and, in order that he may always be alone in the garden, and that the nuns may be warned to avoid him, a bell is attached to his knee.
U||Their submission to the prioress is absolute and passive. It is the canonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation. As at the voice of Christ, ut voci Christi, at a gesture, at the first sign, ad nutum, ad primum signum, immediately, with cheerfulness, with perseverance, with a certain blind obedience, prompte, hilariter, perseveranter et c√¶ca quadam obedientia, as the file in the hand of the workman, quasi limam in manibus fabri, without power to read or to write without express permission, legere vel scribere non addiscerit sine expressa superioris licentia.
U||Each one of them in turn makes what they call reparation. The reparation is the prayer for all the sins, for all the faults, for all the dissensions, for all the violations, for all the iniquities, for all the crimes committed on earth. For the space of twelve consecutive hours, from four o‚Äôclock in the afternoon till four o‚Äôclock in the morning, or from four o‚Äôclock in the morning until four o‚Äôclock in the afternoon, the sister who is making reparation remains on her knees on the stone before the Holy Sacrament, with hands clasped, a rope around her neck. When her fatigue becomes unendurable, she prostrates herself flat on her face against the earth, with her arms outstretched in the form of a cross; this is her only relief. In this attitude she prays for all the guilty in the universe. This is great to sublimity.
U||As this act is performed in front of a post on which burns a candle, it is called without distinction, to make reparation or to be at the post. The nuns even prefer, out of humility, this last expression, which contains an idea of torture and abasement.
U||To make reparation is a function in which the whole soul is absorbed. The sister at the post would not turn round were a thunderbolt to fall directly behind her.
U||Besides this, there is always a sister kneeling before the Holy Sacrament. This station lasts an hour. They relieve each other like soldiers on guard. This is the Perpetual Adoration.
U||The prioresses and the mothers almost always bear names stamped with peculiar solemnity, recalling, not the saints and martyrs, but moments in the life of Jesus Christ: as Mother Nativity, Mother Conception, Mother Presentation, Mother Passion. But the names of saints are not interdicted.
U||When one sees them, one never sees anything but their mouths.
U||All their teeth are yellow. No tooth-brush ever entered that convent. Brushing one‚Äôs teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the loss of one‚Äôs soul.
U||They never say my. They possess nothing of their own, and they must not attach themselves to anything. They call everything our; thus: our veil, our chaplet; if they were speaking of their chemise, they would say our chemise. Sometimes they grow attached to some petty object,‚Äîto a book of hours, a relic, a medal that has been blessed. As soon as they become aware that they are growing attached to this object, they must give it up. They recall the words of Saint Th√©r√®se, to whom a great lady said, as she was on the point of entering her order, ‚ÄúPermit me, mother, to send for a Bible to which I am greatly attached.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, you are attached to something! In that case, do not enter our order!‚Äù
U||Every person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up, to have a place of her own, a chamber. They live with their cells open. When they meet, one says, ‚ÄúBlessed and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!‚Äù The other responds, ‚ÄúForever.‚Äù The same ceremony when one taps at the other‚Äôs door. Hardly has she touched the door when a soft voice on the other side is heard to say hastily, ‚ÄúForever!‚Äù Like all practices, this becomes mechanical by force of habit; and one sometimes says forever before the other has had time to say the rather long sentence, ‚ÄúPraised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar.‚Äù
U||Among the Visitandines the one who enters says: ‚ÄúAve Maria,‚Äù and the one whose cell is entered says, ‚ÄúGratia plena.‚Äù It is their way of saying good day, which is in fact full of grace.
U||At each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the church bell of the convent. At this signal prioress, vocal mothers, professed nuns, lay-sisters, novices, postulants, interrupt what they are saying, what they are doing, or what they are thinking, and all say in unison if it is five o‚Äôclock, for instance, ‚ÄúAt five o‚Äôclock and at all hours praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!‚Äù If it is eight o‚Äôclock, ‚ÄúAt eight o‚Äôclock and at all hours!‚Äù and so on, according to the hour.
U||This custom, the object of which is to break the thread of thought and to lead it back constantly to God, exists in many communities; the formula alone varies. Thus at The Infant Jesus they say, ‚ÄúAt this hour and at every hour may the love of Jesus kindle my heart!‚Äù The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga, cloistered fifty years ago at Petit-Picpus, chant the offices to a solemn psalmody, a pure Gregorian chant, and always with full voice during the whole course of the office. Everywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they pause, and say in a low voice, ‚ÄúJesus-Marie-Joseph.‚Äù For the office of the dead they adopt a tone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such a depth. The effect produced is striking and tragic.
U||The nuns of the Petit-Picpus had made a vault under their grand altar for the burial of their community. The Government, as they say, does not permit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent when they die. This is an affliction to them, and causes them consternation as an infraction of the rules.
U||They had obtained a mediocre consolation at best,‚Äîpermission to be interred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancient Vaugirard cemetery, which was made of land which had formerly belonged to their community.
U||On Fridays the nuns hear high mass, vespers, and all the offices, as on Sunday. They scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivals unknown to people of the world, of which the Church of France was so prodigal in the olden days, and of which it is still prodigal in Spain and Italy. Their stations in the chapel are interminable. As for the number and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea of them than by quoting the ingenuous remark of one of them: ‚ÄúThe prayers of the postulants are frightful, the prayers of the novices are still worse, and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse.‚Äù
U||Once a week the chapter assembles: the prioress presides; the vocal mothers assist. Each sister kneels in turn on the stones, and confesses aloud, in the presence of all, the faults and sins which she has committed during the week. The vocal mothers consult after each confession and inflict the penance aloud.
U||Besides this confession in a loud tone, for which all faults in the least serious are reserved, they have for their venial offences what they call the coulpe. To make one‚Äôs coulpe means to prostrate one‚Äôs self flat on one‚Äôs face during the office in front of the prioress until the latter, who is never called anything but our mother, notifies the culprit by a slight tap of her foot against the wood of her stall that she can rise. The coulpe or peccavi, is made for a very small matter‚Äîa broken glass, a torn veil, an involuntary delay of a few seconds at an office, a false note in church, etc.; this suffices, and the coulpe is made. The coulpe is entirely spontaneous; it is the culpable person herself (the word is etymologically in its place here) who judges herself and inflicts it on herself. On festival days and Sundays four mother precentors intone the offices before a large reading-desk with four places. One day one of the mother precentors intoned a psalm beginning with Ecce, and instead of Ecce sh
U||e uttered aloud the three notes do si sol; for this piece of absent-mindedness she underwent a coulpe which lasted during the whole service: what rendered the fault enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed.
U||When a nun is summoned to the parlor, even were it the prioress herself, she drops her veil, as will be remembered, so that only her mouth is visible.
U||The prioress alone can hold communication with strangers. The others can see only their immediate family, and that very rarely. If, by chance, an outsider presents herself to see a nun, or one whom she has known and loved in the outer world, a regular series of negotiations is required. If it is a woman, the authorization may sometimes be granted; the nun comes, and they talk to her through the shutters, which are opened only for a mother or sister. It is unnecessary to say that permission is always refused to men.
U||Such is the rule of Saint-Beno√Æt, aggravated by Martin Verga.
U||These nuns are not gay, rosy, and fresh, as the daughters of other orders often are. They are pale and grave. Between 1825 and 1830 three of them went mad.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîAUSTERITIES
U||One is a postulant for two years at least, often for four; a novice for four. It is rare that the definitive vows can be pronounced earlier than the age of twenty-three or twenty-four years. The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga do not admit widows to their order.
U||In their cells, they deliver themselves up to many unknown macerations, of which they must never speak.
U||On the day when a novice makes her profession, she is dressed in her handsomest attire, she is crowned with white roses, her hair is brushed until it shines, and curled. Then she prostrates herself; a great black veil is thrown over her, and the office for the dead is sung. Then the nuns separate into two files; one file passes close to her, saying in plaintive accents, ‚ÄúOur sister is dead‚Äù; and the other file responds in a voice of ecstasy, ‚ÄúOur sister is alive in Jesus Christ!‚Äù
U||At the epoch when this story takes place, a boarding-school was attached to the convent‚Äîa boarding-school for young girls of noble and mostly wealthy families, among whom could be remarked Mademoiselle de Saint-Aulaire and de B√©lissen, and an English girl bearing the illustrious Catholic name of Talbot. These young girls, reared by these nuns between four walls, grew up with a horror of the world and of the age. One of them said to us one day, ‚ÄúThe sight of the street pavement made me shudder from head to foot.‚Äù They were dressed in blue, with a white cap and a Holy Spirit of silver gilt or of copper on their breast. On certain grand festival days, particularly Saint Martha‚Äôs day, they were permitted, as a high favor and a supreme happiness, to dress themselves as nuns and to carry out the offices and practice of Saint-Beno√Æt for a whole day. In the early days the nuns were in the habit of lending them their black garments. This seemed profane, and the prioress forbade it. Only the novices were per
U||mitted to lend. It is remarkable that these performances, tolerated and encouraged, no doubt, in the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and in order to give these children a foretaste of the holy habit, were a genuine happiness and a real recreation for the scholars. They simply amused themselves with it. It was new; it gave them a change. Candid reasons of childhood, which do not, however, succeed in making us worldlings comprehend the felicity of holding a holy water sprinkler in one‚Äôs hand and standing for hours together singing hard enough for four in front of a reading-desk.
U||The pupils conformed, with the exception of the austerities, to all the practices of the convent. There was a certain young woman who entered the world, and who after many years of married life had not succeeded in breaking herself of the habit of saying in great haste whenever any one knocked at her door, ‚Äúforever!‚Äù Like the nuns, the pupils saw their relatives only in the parlor. Their very mothers did not obtain permission to embrace them. The following illustrates to what a degree severity on that point was carried. One day a young girl received a visit from her mother, who was accompanied by a little sister three years of age. The young girl wept, for she wished greatly to embrace her sister. Impossible. She begged that, at least, the child might be permitted to pass her little hand through the bars so that she could kiss it. This was almost indignantly refused.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîGAYETIES
U||Nonetheless, these young girls filled this grave house with charming souvenirs.
U||At certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister. The recreation hour struck. A door swung on its hinges. The birds said, ‚ÄúGood; here come the children!‚Äù An irruption of youth inundated that garden intersected with a cross like a shroud. Radiant faces, white foreheads, innocent eyes, full of merry light, all sorts of auroras, were scattered about amid these shadows. After the psalmodies, the bells, the peals, and knells and offices, the sound of these little girls burst forth on a sudden more sweetly than the noise of bees. The hive of joy was opened, and each one brought her honey. They played, they called to each other, they formed into groups, they ran about; pretty little white teeth chattered in the corners; the veils superintended the laughs from a distance, shades kept watch of the sunbeams, but what mattered it? Still they beamed and laughed. Those four lugubrious walls had their moment of dazzling brilliancy. They looked on, vaguely blanched with the reflection of so much joy at this sweet s
U||warming of the hives. It was like a shower of roses falling athwart this house of mourning. The young girls frolicked beneath the eyes of the nuns; the gaze of impeccability does not embarrass innocence. Thanks to these children, there was, among so many austere hours, one hour of ingenuousness. The little ones skipped about; the elder ones danced. In this cloister play was mingled with heaven. Nothing is so delightful and so august as all these fresh, expanding young souls. Homer would have come thither to laugh with Perrault; and there was in that black garden, youth, health, noise, cries, giddiness, pleasure, happiness enough to smooth out the wrinkles of all their ancestresses, those of the epic as well as those of the fairy-tale, those of the throne as well as those of the thatched cottage from Hecuba to la M√®re-Grand.
U||In that house more than anywhere else, perhaps, arise those children‚Äôs sayings which are so graceful and which evoke a smile that is full of thoughtfulness. It was between those four gloomy walls that a child of five years exclaimed one day: ‚ÄúMother! one of the big girls has just told me that I have only nine years and ten months longer to remain here. What happiness!‚Äù
U||It was here, too, that this memorable dialogue took place:‚Äî
U||A Vocal Mother. Why are you weeping, my child?
U||The child (aged six). I told Alix that I knew my French history. She says that I do not know it, but I do.
U||Alix, the big girl (aged nine). No; she does not know it.
U||The Mother. How is that, my child?
U||Alix. She told me to open the book at random and to ask her any question in the book, and she would answer it.
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe did not answer it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúLet us see about it. What did you ask her?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI opened the book at random, as she proposed, and I put the first question that I came across.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd what was the question?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt was, ‚ÄòWhat happened after that?‚Äô‚Äù
U||It was there that that profound remark was made anent a rather greedy paroquet which belonged to a lady boarder:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHow well bred! it eats the top of the slice of bread and butter just like a person!‚Äù
U||It was on one of the flagstones of this cloister that there was once picked up a confession which had been written out in advance, in order that she might not forget it, by a sinner of seven years:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFather, I accuse myself of having been avaricious.
U||‚ÄúFather, I accuse myself of having been an adulteress.
U||‚ÄúFather, I accuse myself of having raised my eyes to the gentlemen.‚Äù
U||It was on one of the turf benches of this garden that a rosy mouth six years of age improvised the following tale, which was listened to by blue eyes aged four and five years:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThere were three little cocks who owned a country where there were a great many flowers. They plucked the flowers and put them in their pockets. After that they plucked the leaves and put them in their playthings. There was a wolf in that country; there was a great deal of forest; and the wolf was in the forest; and he ate the little cocks.‚Äù
U||And this other poem:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThere came a blow with a stick.
U||‚ÄúIt was Punchinello who bestowed it on the cat.
U||‚ÄúIt was not good for her; it hurt her.
U||‚ÄúThen a lady put Punchinello in prison.‚Äù
U||It was there that a little abandoned child, a foundling whom the convent was bringing up out of charity, uttered this sweet and heart-breaking saying. She heard the others talking of their mothers, and she murmured in her corner:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAs for me, my mother was not there when I was born!‚Äù
U||There was a stout portress who could always be seen hurrying through the corridors with her bunch of keys, and whose name was Sister Agatha. The big big girls‚Äîthose over ten years of age‚Äîcalled her Agathocles.
U||The refectory, a large apartment of an oblong square form, which received no light except through a vaulted cloister on a level with the garden, was dark and damp, and, as the children say, full of beasts. All the places round about furnished their contingent of insects.
U||Each of its four corners had received, in the language of the pupils, a special and expressive name. There was Spider corner, Caterpillar corner, Wood-louse corner, and Cricket corner.
U||Cricket corner was near the kitchen and was highly esteemed. It was not so cold there as elsewhere. From the refectory the names had passed to the boarding-school, and there served as in the old College Mazarin to distinguish four nations. Every pupil belonged to one of these four nations according to the corner of the refectory in which she sat at meals. One day Monseigneur the Archbishop while making his pastoral visit saw a pretty little rosy girl with beautiful golden hair enter the class-room through which he was passing.
U||He inquired of another pupil, a charming brunette with rosy cheeks, who stood near him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWho is that?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe is a spider, Monseigneur.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBah! And that one yonder?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe is a cricket.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd that one?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe is a caterpillar.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúReally! and yourself?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am a wood-louse, Monseigneur.‚Äù
U||Every house of this sort has its own peculiarities. At the beginning of this century √âcouen was one of those strict and graceful places where young girls pass their childhood in a shadow that is almost august. At √âcouen, in order to take rank in the procession of the Holy Sacrament, a distinction was made between virgins and florists. There were also the ‚Äúdais‚Äù and the ‚Äúcensors,‚Äù‚Äîthe first who held the cords of the dais, and the others who carried incense before the Holy Sacrament. The flowers belonged by right to the florists. Four ‚Äúvirgins‚Äù walked in advance. On the morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear the question put in the dormitory, ‚ÄúWho is a virgin?‚Äù
U||Madame Campan used to quote this saying of a ‚Äúlittle one‚Äù of seven years, to a ‚Äúbig girl‚Äù of sixteen, who took the head of the procession, while she, the little one, remained at the rear, ‚ÄúYou are a virgin, but I am not.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîDISTRACTIONS
U||Above the door of the refectory this prayer, which was called the white Paternoster, and which possessed the property of bearing people straight to paradise, was inscribed in large black letters:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLittle white Paternoster, which God made, which God said, which God placed in paradise. In the evening, when I went to bed, I found three angels sitting on my bed, one at the foot, two at the head, the good Virgin Mary in the middle, who told me to lie down without hesitation. The good God is my father, the good Virgin is my mother, the three apostles are my brothers, the three virgins are my sisters. The shirt in which God was born envelopes my body; Saint Margaret‚Äôs cross is written on my breast. Madame the Virgin was walking through the meadows, weeping for God, when she met M. Saint John. ‚ÄòMonsieur Saint John, whence come you?‚Äô ‚ÄòI come from Ave Salus.‚Äô ‚ÄòYou have not seen the good God; where is he?‚Äô ‚ÄòHe is on the tree of the Cross, his feet hanging, his hands nailed, a little cap of white thorns on his head.‚Äô Whoever shall say this thrice at eventide, thrice in the morning, shall win paradise at the last.‚Äù
U||In 1827 this characteristic orison had disappeared from the wall under a triple coating of daubing paint. At the present time it is finally disappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then, and who are old women now.
U||A large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of this refectory, whose only door, as we think we have mentioned, opened on the garden. Two narrow tables, each flanked by two wooden benches, formed two long parallel lines from one end to the other of the refectory. The walls were white, the tables were black; these two mourning colors constitute the only variety in convents. The meals were plain, and the food of the children themselves severe. A single dish of meat and vegetables combined, or salt fish‚Äîsuch was their luxury. This meagre fare, which was reserved for the pupils alone, was, nevertheless, an exception. The children ate in silence, under the eye of the mother whose turn it was, who, if a fly took a notion to fly or to hum against the rule, opened and shut a wooden book from time to time. This silence was seasoned with the lives of the saints, read aloud from a little pulpit with a desk, which was situated at the foot of the crucifix. The reader was one of the big girls, in weekl
U||y turn. At regular distances, on the bare tables, there were large, varnished bowls in which the pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forks, and into which they sometimes threw some scrap of tough meat or spoiled fish; this was punished. These bowls were called ronds d‚Äôeau. The child who broke the silence ‚Äúmade a cross with her tongue.‚Äù Where? On the ground. She licked the pavement. The dust, that end of all joys, was charged with the chastisement of those poor little rose-leaves which had been guilty of chirping.
U||There was in the convent a book which has never been printed except as a unique copy, and which it is forbidden to read. It is the rule of Saint-Beno√Æt. An arcanum which no profane eye must penetrate. Nemo regulas, seu constitutiones nostras, externis communicabit.
U||The pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book, and set to reading it with avidity, a reading which was often interrupted by the fear of being caught, which caused them to close the volume precipitately.
U||From the great danger thus incurred they derived but a very moderate amount of pleasure. The most ‚Äúinteresting thing‚Äù they found were some unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys.
U||They played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby fruit-trees. In spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of the punishments administered, when the wind had shaken the trees, they sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or an inhabited pear on the sly. I will now cede the privilege of speech to a letter which lies before me, a letter written five and twenty years ago by an old pupil, now Madame la Duchesse de ‚Äî‚Äî, one of the most elegant women in Paris. I quote literally: ‚ÄúOne hides one‚Äôs pear or one‚Äôs apple as best one may. When one goes upstairs to put the veil on the bed before supper, one stuffs them under one‚Äôs pillow and at night one eats them in bed, and when one cannot do that, one eats them in the closet.‚Äù That was one of their greatest luxuries.
U||Once‚Äîit was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to the convent‚Äîone of the young girls, Mademoiselle Bouchard, who was connected with the Montmorency family, laid a wager that she would ask for a day‚Äôs leave of absence‚Äîan enormity in so austere a community. The wager was accepted, but not one of those who bet believed that she would do it. When the moment came, as the archbishop was passing in front of the pupils, Mademoiselle Bouchard, to the indescribable terror of her companions, stepped out of the ranks, and said, ‚ÄúMonseigneur, a day‚Äôs leave of absence.‚Äù Mademoiselle Bouchard was tall, blooming, with the prettiest little rosy face in the world. M. de Qu√©len smiled and said, ‚ÄúWhat, my dear child, a day‚Äôs leave of absence! Three days if you like. I grant you three days.‚Äù The prioress could do nothing; the archbishop had spoken. Horror of the convent, but joy of the pupil. The effect may be imagined.
U||This stern cloister was not so well walled off, however, but that the life of the passions of the outside world, drama, and even romance, did not make their way in. To prove this, we will confine ourselves to recording here and to briefly mentioning a real and incontestable fact, which, however, bears no reference in itself to, and is not connected by any thread whatever with the story which we are relating. We mention the fact for the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in the reader‚Äôs mind.
U||About this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who was not a nun, who was treated with great respect, and who was addressed as Madame Albertine. Nothing was known about her, save that she was mad, and that in the world she passed for dead. Beneath this history it was said there lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great marriage.
U||This woman, hardly thirty years of age, of dark complexion and tolerably pretty, had a vague look in her large black eyes. Could she see? There was some doubt about this. She glided rather than walked, she never spoke; it was not quite known whether she breathed. Her nostrils were livid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh. To touch her hand was like touching snow. She possessed a strange spectral grace. Wherever she entered, people felt cold. One day a sister, on seeing her pass, said to another sister, ‚ÄúShe passes for a dead woman.‚Äù ‚ÄúPerhaps she is one,‚Äù replied the other.
U||A hundred tales were told of Madame Albertine. This arose from the eternal curiosity of the pupils. In the chapel there was a gallery called L‚Äô≈íil de B≈ìuf. It was in this gallery, which had only a circular bay, an ≈ìil de b≈ìuf, that Madame Albertine listened to the offices. She always occupied it alone because this gallery, being on the level of the first story, the preacher or the officiating priest could be seen, which was interdicted to the nuns. One day the pulpit was occupied by a young priest of high rank, M. Le Duc de Rohan, peer of France, officer of the Red Musketeers in 1815 when he was Prince de L√©on, and who died afterward, in 1830, as cardinal and Archbishop of Besan√ßon. It was the first time that M. de Rohan had preached at the Petit-Picpus convent. Madame Albertine usually preserved perfect calmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services. That day, as soon as she caught sight of M. de Rohan, she half rose, and said, in a loud voice, amid the silence of the chapel, ‚ÄúAh
U||! Auguste!‚Äù The whole community turned their heads in amazement, the preacher raised his eyes, but Madame Albertine had relapsed into her immobility. A breath from the outer world, a flash of life, had passed for an instant across that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished, and the mad woman had become a corpse again.
U||Those two words, however, had set every one in the convent who had the privilege of speech to chattering. How many things were contained in that ‚ÄúAh! Auguste!‚Äù what revelations! M. de Rohan‚Äôs name really was Auguste. It was evident that Madame Albertine belonged to the very highest society, since she knew M. de Rohan, and that her own rank there was of the highest, since she spoke thus familiarly of so great a lord, and that there existed between them some connection, of relationship, perhaps, but a very close one in any case, since she knew his ‚Äúpet name.‚Äù
U||Two very severe duchesses, Mesdames de Choiseul and de S√©rent, often visited the community, whither they penetrated, no doubt, in virtue of the privilege Magnates mulieres, and caused great consternation in the boarding-school. When these two old ladies passed by, all the poor young girls trembled and dropped their eyes.
U||Moreover, M. de Rohan, quite unknown to himself, was an object of attention to the school-girls. At that epoch he had just been made, while waiting for the episcopate, vicar-general of the Archbishop of Paris. It was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate the offices in the chapel of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus. Not one of the young recluses could see him, because of the serge curtain, but he had a sweet and rather shrill voice, which they had come to know and to distinguish. He had been a mousquetaire, and then, he was said to be very coquettish, that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed in a roll around his head, and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent moire, and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the world. He held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen years.
U||Not a sound from without made its way into the convent. But there was one year when the sound of a flute penetrated thither. This was an event, and the girls who were at school there at the time still recall it.
U||It was a flute which was played in the neighborhood. This flute always played the same air, an air which is very far away nowadays,‚Äî‚ÄúMy Z√©tulb√©, come reign o‚Äôer my soul,‚Äù‚Äîand it was heard two or three times a day. The young girls passed hours in listening to it, the vocal mothers were upset by it, brains were busy, punishments descended in showers. This lasted for several months. The girls were all more or less in love with the unknown musician. Each one dreamed that she was Z√©tulb√©. The sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the Rue Droit-Mur; and they would have given anything, compromised everything, attempted anything for the sake of seeing, of catching a glance, if only for a second, of the ‚Äúyoung man‚Äù who played that flute so deliciously, and who, no doubt, played on all these souls at the same time. There were some who made their escape by a back door, and ascended to the third story on the Rue Droit-Mur side, in order to attempt to catch a glimpse through the gaps. Impos
U||sible! One even went so far as to thrust her arm through the grating, and to wave her white handkerchief. Two were still bolder. They found means to climb on a roof, and risked their lives there, and succeeded at last in seeing ‚Äúthe young man.‚Äù He was an old √©migr√© gentleman, blind and penniless, who was playing his flute in his attic, in order to pass the time.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîTHE LITTLE CONVENT
U||In this enclosure of the Petit-Picpus there were three perfectly distinct buildings,‚Äîthe Great Convent, inhabited by the nuns, the Boarding-school, where the scholars were lodged; and lastly, what was called the Little Convent. It was a building with a garden, in which lived all sorts of aged nuns of various orders, the relics of cloisters destroyed in the Revolution; a reunion of all the black, gray, and white medleys of all communities and all possible varieties; what might be called, if such a coupling of words is permissible, a sort of harlequin convent.
U||When the Empire was established, all these poor old dispersed and exiled women had been accorded permission to come and take shelter under the wings of the Bernardines-Benedictines. The government paid them a small pension, the ladies of the Petit-Picpus received them cordially. It was a singular pell-mell. Each followed her own rule. Sometimes the pupils of the boarding-school were allowed, as a great recreation, to pay them a visit; the result is, that all those young memories have retained among other souvenirs that of Mother Sainte-Bazile, Mother Sainte-Scolastique, and Mother Jacob.
U||One of these refugees found herself almost at home. She was a nun of Sainte-Aure, the only one of her order who had survived. The ancient convent of the ladies of Sainte-Aure occupied, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, this very house of the Petit-Picpus, which belonged later to the Benedictines of Martin Verga. This holy woman, too poor to wear the magnificent habit of her order, which was a white robe with a scarlet scapulary, had piously put it on a little manikin, which she exhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house at her death. In 1824, only one nun of this order remained; to-day, there remains only a doll.
U||In addition to these worthy mothers, some old society women had obtained permission of the prioress, like Madame Albertine, to retire into the Little Convent. Among the number were Madame Beaufort d‚ÄôHautpoul and Marquise Dufresne. Another was never known in the convent except by the formidable noise which she made when she blew her nose. The pupils called her Madame Vacarmini (hubbub).
U||About 1820 or 1821, Madame de Genlis, who was at that time editing a little periodical publication called l‚ÄôIntr√©pide, asked to be allowed to enter the convent of the Petit-Picpus as lady resident. The Duc d‚ÄôOrl√©ans recommended her. Uproar in the hive; the vocal-mothers were all in a flutter; Madame de Genlis had made romances. But she declared that she was the first to detest them, and then, she had reached her fierce stage of devotion. With the aid of God, and of the Prince, she entered. She departed at the end of six or eight months, alleging as a reason, that there was no shade in the garden. The nuns were delighted. Although very old, she still played the harp, and did it very well.
U||When she went away she left her mark in her cell. Madame de Genlis was superstitious and a Latinist. These two words furnish a tolerably good profile of her. A few years ago, there were still to be seen, pasted in the inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up her silverware and her jewels, these five lines in Latin, written with her own hand in red ink on yellow paper, and which, in her opinion, possessed the property of frightening away robbers:‚Äî
U||Imparibus meritis pendent tria corpora ramis:
U||Dismas et Gesmas, media est divina potestas;
U||Alta petit Dismas, infelix, infima, Gesmas;
U||Nos et res nostras conservet summa potestas.
U||Hos versus dicas, ne tu furto tua perdas.15
U||These verses in sixth century Latin raise the question whether the two thieves of Calvary were named, as is commonly believed, Dismas and Gestas, or Dismas and Gesmas. This orthography might have confounded the pretensions put forward in the last century by the Vicomte de Gestas, of a descent from the wicked thief. However, the useful virtue attached to these verses forms an article of faith in the order of the Hospitallers.
U||The church of the house, constructed in such a manner as to separate the Great Convent from the Boarding-school like a veritable intrenchment, was, of course, common to the Boarding-school, the Great Convent, and the Little Convent. The public was even admitted by a sort of lazaretto entrance on the street. But all was so arranged, that none of the inhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outside world. Suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand, and folded in such a manner as to form, not, as in ordinary churches, a prolongation behind the altar, but a sort of hall, or obscure cellar, to the right of the officiating priest; suppose this hall to be shut off by a curtain seven feet in height, of which we have already spoken; in the shadow of that curtain, pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in the choir on the left, the school-girls on the right, the lay-sisters and the novices at the bottom, and you will have some idea of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus assisting at divine service. Th
U||at cavern, which was called the choir, communicated with the cloister by a lobby. The church was lighted from the garden. When the nuns were present at services where their rule enjoined silence, the public was warned of their presence only by the folding seats of the stalls noisily rising and falling.
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîSOME SILHOUETTES OF THIS DARKNESS
U||During the six years which separate 1819 from 1825, the prioress of the Petit-Picpus was Mademoiselle de Blemeur, whose name, in religion, was Mother Innocente. She came of the family of Marguerite de Blemeur, author of Lives of the Saints of the Order of Saint-Beno√Æt. She had been re-elected. She was a woman about sixty years of age, short, thick, ‚Äúsinging like a cracked pot,‚Äù says the letter which we have already quoted; an excellent woman, moreover, and the only merry one in the whole convent, and for that reason adored. She was learned, erudite, wise, competent, curiously proficient in history, crammed with Latin, stuffed with Greek, full of Hebrew, and more of a Benedictine monk than a Benedictine nun.
U||The sub-prioress was an old Spanish nun, Mother Cineres, who was almost blind.
U||The most esteemed among the vocal mothers were Mother Sainte-Honorine; the treasurer, Mother Sainte-Gertrude, the chief mistress of the novices; Mother-Saint-Ange, the assistant mistress; Mother Annonciation, the sacristan; Mother Saint-Augustin, the nurse, the only one in the convent who was malicious; then Mother Sainte-Mechtilde (Mademoiselle Gauvain), very young and with a beautiful voice; Mother des Anges (Mademoiselle Drouet), who had been in the convent of the Filles-Dieu, and in the convent du Tr√©sor, between Gisors and Magny; Mother Saint-Joseph (Mademoiselle de Cogolludo), Mother Sainte-Ad√©laide (Mademoiselle d‚ÄôAuverney), Mother Mis√©ricorde (Mademoiselle de Cifuentes, who could not resist austerities), Mother Compassion (Mademoiselle de la Milti√®re, received at the age of sixty in defiance of the rule, and very wealthy); Mother Providence (Mademoiselle de Laudini√®re), Mother Pr√©sentation (Mademoiselle de Siguenza), who was prioress in 1847; and finally, Mother Sainte-C√©ligne (sister of the
U|| sculptor Ceracchi), who went mad; Mother Sainte-Chantal (Mademoiselle de Suzon), who went mad.
U||There was also, among the prettiest of them, a charming girl of three and twenty, who was from the Isle de Bourbon, a descendant of the Chevalier Roze, whose name had been Mademoiselle Roze, and who was called Mother Assumption.
U||Mother Sainte-Mechtilde, intrusted with the singing and the choir, was fond of making use of the pupils in this quarter. She usually took a complete scale of them, that is to say, seven, from ten to sixteen years of age, inclusive, of assorted voices and sizes, whom she made sing standing, drawn up in a line, side by side, according to age, from the smallest to the largest. This presented to the eye, something in the nature of a reed-pipe of young girls, a sort of living Pan-pipe made of angels.
U||Those of the lay-sisters whom the scholars loved most were Sister Euphrasie, Sister Sainte-Margu√©rite, Sister Sainte-Marthe, who was in her dotage, and Sister Sainte-Michel, whose long nose made them laugh.
U||All these women were gentle with the children. The nuns were severe only towards themselves. No fire was lighted except in the school, and the food was choice compared to that in the convent. Moreover, they lavished a thousand cares on their scholars. Only, when a child passed near a nun and addressed her, the nun never replied.
U||This rule of silence had had this effect, that throughout the whole convent, speech had been withdrawn from human creatures, and bestowed on inanimate objects. Now it was the church-bell which spoke, now it was the gardener‚Äôs bell. A very sonorous bell, placed beside the portress, and which was audible throughout the house, indicated by its varied peals, which formed a sort of acoustic telegraph, all the actions of material life which were to be performed, and summoned to the parlor, in case of need, such or such an inhabitant of the house. Each person and each thing had its own peal. The prioress had one and one, the sub-prioress one and two. Six-five announced lessons, so that the pupils never said ‚Äúto go to lessons,‚Äù but ‚Äúto go to six-five.‚Äù Four-four was Madame de Genlis‚Äôs signal. It was very often heard. ‚ÄúC‚Äôest le diable a quatre,‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs the very deuce‚Äîsaid the uncharitable. Tennine strokes announced a great event. It was the opening of the door of seclusion, a frightful sheet of 
U||iron bristling with bolts which only turned on its hinges in the presence of the archbishop.
U||With the exception of the archbishop and the gardener, no man entered the convent, as we have already said. The schoolgirls saw two others: one, the chaplain, the Abb√© Ban√©s, old and ugly, whom they were permitted to contemplate in the choir, through a grating; the other the drawing-master, M. Ansiaux, whom the letter, of which we have perused a few lines, calls M. Anciot, and describes as a frightful old hunchback.
U||It will be seen that all these men were carefully chosen.
U||Such was this curious house.
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîPOST CORDA LAPIDES
U||After having sketched its moral face, it will not prove unprofitable to point out, in a few words, its material configuration. The reader already has some idea of it.
U||The convent of the Petit-Picpus-Sainte-Antoine filled almost the whole of the vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the Rue Polonceau, the Rue Droit-Mur, the Rue Petit-Picpus, and the unused lane, called Rue Aumarais on old plans. These four streets surrounded this trapezium like a moat. The convent was composed of several buildings and a garden. The principal building, taken in its entirety, was a juxtaposition of hybrid constructions which, viewed from a bird‚Äôs-eye view, outlined, with considerable exactness, a gibbet laid flat on the ground. The main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of the fragment of the Rue Droit-Mur comprised between the Rue Petit-Picpus and the Rue Polonceau; the lesser arm was a lofty, gray, severe grated fa√ßade which faced the Rue Petit-Picpus; the carriage entrance No. 62 marked its extremity. Towards the centre of this fa√ßade was a low, arched door, whitened with dust and ashes, where the spiders wove their webs, and which was open only for an hour or two 
U||on Sundays, and on rare occasions, when the coffin of a nun left the convent. This was the public entrance of the church. The elbow of the gibbet was a square hall which was used as the servants‚Äô hall, and which the nuns called the buttery. In the main arm were the cells of the mothers, the sisters, and the novices. In the lesser arm lay the kitchens, the refectory, backed up by the cloisters and the church. Between the door No. 62 and the corner of the closed Aumarais Lane, was the school, which was not visible from without. The remainder of the trapezium formed the garden, which was much lower than the level of the Rue Polonceau, which caused the walls to be very much higher on the inside than on the outside. The garden, which was slightly arched, had in its centre, on the summit of a hillock, a fine pointed and conical fir-tree, whence ran, as from the peaked boss of a shield, four grand alleys, and, ranged by twos in between the branchings of these, eight small ones, so that, if the enclosure had been 
U||circular, the geometrical plan of the alleys would have resembled a cross superposed on a wheel. As the alleys all ended in the very irregular walls of the garden, they were of unequal length. They were bordered with currant bushes. At the bottom, an alley of tall poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent, which was at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur to the house of the Little Convent, which was at the angle of the Aumarais Lane. In front of the Little Convent was what was called the little garden. To this whole, let the reader add a courtyard, all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings, prison walls, the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the Rue Polonceau for its sole perspective and neighborhood, and he will be able to form for himself a complete image of what the house of the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus was forty years ago. This holy house had been built on the precise site of a famous tennis-ground of the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, which was calle
U||d the ‚Äútennis-ground of the eleven thousand devils.‚Äù
U||All these streets, moreover, were more ancient than Paris. These names, Droit-Mur and Aumarais, are very ancient; the streets which bear them are very much more ancient still. Aumarais Lane was called Maugout Lane; the Rue Droit-Mur was called the Rue des √âglantiers, for God opened flowers before man cut stones.
U||CHAPTER IX‚ÄîA CENTURY UNDER A GUIMPE
U||Since we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent of the Petit-Picpus was in former times, and since we have ventured to open a window on that discreet retreat, the reader will permit us one other little digression, utterly foreign to this book, but characteristic and useful, since it shows that the cloister even has its original figures.
U||In the Little Convent there was a centenarian who came from the Abbey of Fontevrault. She had even been in society before the Revolution. She talked a great deal of M. de Miromesnil, Keeper of the Seals under Louis XVI. and of a Presidentess Duplat, with whom she had been very intimate. It was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext. She told wonders of the Abbey of Fontevrault,‚Äîthat it was like a city, and that there were streets in the monastery.
U||She talked with a Picard accent which amused the pupils. Every year, she solemnly renewed her vows, and at the moment of taking the oath, she said to the priest, ‚ÄúMonseigneur Saint-Fran√ßois gave it to Monseigneur Saint-Julien, Monseigneur Saint-Julien gave it to Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius, Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius gave it to Monseigneur Saint-Procopius, etc., etc.; and thus I give it to you, father.‚Äù And the school-girls would begin to laugh, not in their sleeves, but under their veils; charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers frown.
U||On another occasion, the centenarian was telling stories. She said that in her youth the Bernardine monks were every whit as good as the mousquetaires. It was a century which spoke through her, but it was the eighteenth century. She told about the custom of the four wines, which existed before the Revolution in Champagne and Bourgogne. When a great personage, a marshal of France, a prince, a duke, and a peer, traversed a town in Burgundy or Champagne, the city fathers came out to harangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which they had poured four different sorts of wine. On the first goblet this inscription could be read, monkey wine; on the second, lion wine; on the third, sheep wine; on the fourth, hog wine. These four legends express the four stages descended by the drunkard; the first, intoxication, which enlivens; the second, that which irritates; the third, that which dulls; and the fourth, that which brutalizes.
U||In a cupboard, under lock and key, she kept a mysterious object of which she thought a great deal. The rule of Fontevrault did not forbid this. She would not show this object to anyone. She shut herself up, which her rule allowed her to do, and hid herself, every time that she desired to contemplate it. If she heard a footstep in the corridor, she closed the cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands. As soon as it was mentioned to her, she became silent, she who was so fond of talking. The most curious were baffled by her silence and the most tenacious by her obstinacy. Thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent. What could that treasure of the centenarian be, which was so precious and so secret? Some holy book, no doubt? Some unique chaplet? Some authentic relic? They lost themselves in conjectures. When the poor old woman died, they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting, perhaps, and opened it. They found the object
U|| beneath a triple linen cloth, like some consecrated paten. It was a Faenza platter representing little Loves flitting away pursued by apothecary lads armed with enormous syringes. The chase abounds in grimaces and in comical postures. One of the charming little Loves is already fairly spitted. He is resisting, fluttering his tiny wings, and still making an effort to fly, but the dancer is laughing with a satanical air. Moral: Love conquered by the colic. This platter, which is very curious, and which had, possibly, the honor of furnishing Moli√®re with an idea, was still in existence in September, 1845; it was for sale by a bric-√†-brac merchant in the Boulevard Beaumarchais.
U||This good old woman would not receive any visits from outside because, said she, the parlor is too gloomy.
U||CHAPTER X‚ÄîORIGIN OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION
U||However, this almost sepulchral parlor, of which we have sought to convey an idea, is a purely local trait which is not reproduced with the same severity in other convents. At the convent of the Rue du Temple, in particular, which belonged, in truth, to another order, the black shutters were replaced by brown curtains, and the parlor itself was a salon with a polished wood floor, whose windows were draped in white muslin curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames, a portrait of a Benedictine nun with unveiled face, painted bouquets, and even the head of a Turk.
U||It is in that garden of the Temple convent, that stood that famous chestnut-tree which was renowned as the finest and the largest in France, and which bore the reputation among the good people of the eighteenth century of being the father of all the chestnut trees of the realm.
U||As we have said, this convent of the Temple was occupied by Benedictines of the Perpetual Adoration, Benedictines quite different from those who depended on C√Æteaux. This order of the Perpetual Adoration is not very ancient and does not go back more than two hundred years. In 1649 the holy sacrament was profaned on two occasions a few days apart, in two churches in Paris, at Saint-Sulpice and at Saint-Jean en Gr√®ve, a rare and frightful sacrilege which set the whole town in an uproar. M. the Prior and Vicar-General of Saint-Germain des Pr√©s ordered a solemn procession of all his clergy, in which the Pope‚Äôs Nuncio officiated. But this expiation did not satisfy two sainted women, Madame Courtin, Marquise de Boucs, and the Comtesse de Ch√¢teauvieux. This outrage committed on ‚Äúthe most holy sacrament of the altar,‚Äù though but temporary, would not depart from these holy souls, and it seemed to them that it could only be extenuated by a ‚ÄúPerpetual Adoration‚Äù in some female monastery. Both of them, one
U|| in 1652, the other in 1653, made donations of notable sums to Mother Catherine de Bar, called of the Holy Sacrament, a Benedictine nun, for the purpose of founding, to this pious end, a monastery of the order of Saint-Beno√Æt; the first permission for this foundation was given to Mother Catherine de Bar by M. de Metz, Abb√© of Saint-Germain, ‚Äúon condition that no woman could be received unless she contributed three hundred livres income, which amounts to six thousand livres, to the principal.‚Äù After the Abb√© of Saint-Germain, the king accorded letters-patent; and all the rest, abbatial charter, and royal letters, was confirmed in 1654 by the Chamber of Accounts and the Parliament.
U||Such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of the Benedictines of the Perpetual Adoration of the Holy Sacrament at Paris. Their first convent was ‚Äúa new building‚Äù in the Rue Cassette, out of the contributions of Mesdames de Boucs and de Ch√¢teauvieux.
U||This order, as it will be seen, was not to be confounded with the Benedictine nuns of C√Æteaux. It mounted back to the Abb√© of Saint-Germain des Pr√©s, in the same manner that the ladies of the Sacred Heart go back to the general of the Jesuits, and the sisters of charity to the general of the Lazarists.
U||It was also totally different from the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus, whose interior we have just shown. In 1657, Pope Alexander VII. had authorized, by a special brief, the Bernardines of the Rue Petit-Picpus, to practise the Perpetual Adoration like the Benedictine nuns of the Holy Sacrament. But the two orders remained distinct nonetheless.
U||CHAPTER XI‚ÄîEND OF THE PETIT-PICPUS
U||At the beginning of the Restoration, the convent of the Petit-Picpus was in its decay; this forms a part of the general death of the order, which, after the eighteenth century, has been disappearing like all the religious orders. Contemplation is, like prayer, one of humanity‚Äôs needs; but, like everything which the Revolution touched, it will be transformed, and from being hostile to social progress, it will become favorable to it.
U||The house of the Petit-Picpus was becoming rapidly depopulated. In 1840, the Little Convent had disappeared, the school had disappeared. There were no longer any old women, nor young girls; the first were dead, the latter had taken their departure. Volaverunt.
U||The rule of the Perpetual Adoration is so rigid in its nature that it alarms, vocations recoil before it, the order receives no recruits. In 1845, it still obtained lay-sisters here and there. But of professed nuns, none at all. Forty years ago, the nuns numbered nearly a hundred; fifteen years ago there were not more than twenty-eight of them. How many are there to-day? In 1847, the prioress was young, a sign that the circle of choice was restricted. She was not forty years old. In proportion as the number diminishes, the fatigue increases, the service of each becomes more painful; the moment could then be seen drawing near when there would be but a dozen bent and aching shoulders to bear the heavy rule of Saint-Beno√Æt. The burden is implacable, and remains the same for the few as for the many. It weighs down, it crushes. Thus they die. At the period when the author of this book still lived in Paris, two died. One was twenty-five years old, the other twenty-three. This latter can say, like Julia Alpinula: 
U||‚ÄúHic jaceo. Vixi annos viginti et tres.‚Äù It is in consequence of this decay that the convent gave up the education of girls.
U||We have not felt able to pass before this extraordinary house without entering it, and without introducing the minds which accompany us, and which are listening to our tale, to the profit of some, perchance, of the melancholy history of Jean Valjean. We have penetrated into this community, full of those old practices which seem so novel to-day. It is the closed garden, hortus conclusus. We have spoken of this singular place in detail, but with respect, in so far, at least, as detail and respect are compatible. We do not understand all, but we insult nothing. We are equally far removed from the hosanna of Joseph de Maistre, who wound up by anointing the executioner, and from the sneer of Voltaire, who even goes so far as to ridicule the cross.
U||An illogical act on Voltaire‚Äôs part, we may remark, by the way; for Voltaire would have defended Jesus as he defended Calas; and even for those who deny superhuman incarnations, what does the crucifix represent? The assassinated sage.
U||In this nineteenth century, the religious idea is undergoing a crisis. People are unlearning certain things, and they do well, provided that, while unlearning them they learn this: There is no vacuum in the human heart. Certain demolitions take place, and it is well that they do, but on condition that they are followed by reconstructions.
U||In the meantime, let us study things which are no more. It is necessary to know them, if only for the purpose of avoiding them. The counterfeits of the past assume false names, and gladly call themselves the future. This spectre, this past, is given to falsifying its own passport. Let us inform ourselves of the trap. Let us be on our guard. The past has a visage, superstition, and a mask, hypocrisy. Let us denounce the visage and let us tear off the mask.
U||As for convents, they present a complex problem,‚Äîa question of civilization, which condemns them; a question of liberty, which protects them.
U||BOOK SEVENTH‚ÄîPARENTHESIS
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîTHE CONVENT AS AN ABSTRACT IDEA
U||This book is a drama, whose leading personage is the Infinite.
U||Man is the second.
U||Such being the case, and a convent having happened to be on our road, it has been our duty to enter it. Why? Because the convent, which is common to the Orient as well as to the Occident, to antiquity as well as to modern times, to paganism, to Buddhism, to Mahometanism, as well as to Christianity, is one of the optical apparatuses applied by man to the Infinite.
U||This is not the place for enlarging disproportionately on certain ideas; nevertheless, while absolutely maintaining our reserves, our restrictions, and even our indignations, we must say that every time we encounter man in the Infinite, either well or ill understood, we feel ourselves overpowered with respect. There is, in the synagogue, in the mosque, in the pagoda, in the wigwam, a hideous side which we execrate, and a sublime side, which we adore. What a contemplation for the mind, and what endless food for thought, is the reverberation of God upon the human wall!
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîTHE CONVENT AS AN HISTORICAL FACT
U||From the point of view of history, of reason, and of truth, monasticism is condemned. Monasteries, when they abound in a nation, are clogs in its circulation, cumbrous establishments, centres of idleness where centres of labor should exist. Monastic communities are to the great social community what the mistletoe is to the oak, what the wart is to the human body. Their prosperity and their fatness mean the impoverishment of the country. The monastic regime, good at the beginning of civilization, useful in the reduction of the brutal by the spiritual, is bad when peoples have reached their manhood. Moreover, when it becomes relaxed, and when it enters into its period of disorder, it becomes bad for the very reasons which rendered it salutary in its period of purity, because it still continues to set the example.
U||Claustration has had its day. Cloisters, useful in the early education of modern civilization, have embarrassed its growth, and are injurious to its development. So far as institution and formation with relation to man are concerned, monasteries, which were good in the tenth century, questionable in the fifteenth, are detestable in the nineteenth. The leprosy of monasticism has gnawed nearly to a skeleton two wonderful nations, Italy and Spain; the one the light, the other the splendor of Europe for centuries; and, at the present day, these two illustrious peoples are but just beginning to convalesce, thanks to the healthy and vigorous hygiene of 1789 alone.
U||The convent‚Äîthe ancient female convent in particular, such as it still presents itself on the threshold of this century, in Italy, in Austria, in Spain‚Äîis one of the most sombre concretions of the Middle Ages. The cloister, that cloister, is the point of intersection of horrors. The Catholic cloister, properly speaking, is wholly filled with the black radiance of death.
U||The Spanish convent is the most funereal of all. There rise, in obscurity, beneath vaults filled with gloom, beneath domes vague with shadow, massive altars of Babel, as high as cathedrals; there immense white crucifixes hang from chains in the dark; there are extended, all nude on the ebony, great Christs of ivory; more than bleeding,‚Äîbloody; hideous and magnificent, with their elbows displaying the bones, their knee-pans showing their integuments, their wounds showing their flesh, crowned with silver thorns, nailed with nails of gold, with blood drops of rubies on their brows, and diamond tears in their eyes. The diamonds and rubies seem wet, and make veiled beings in the shadow below weep, their sides bruised with the hair shirt and their iron-tipped scourges, their breasts crushed with wicker hurdles, their knees excoriated with prayer; women who think themselves wives, spectres who think themselves seraphim. Do these women think? No. Have they any will? No. Do they love? No. Do they live? No. Their ne
U||rves have turned to bone; their bones have turned to stone. Their veil is of woven night. Their breath under their veil resembles the indescribably tragic respiration of death. The abbess, a spectre, sanctifies them and terrifies them. The immaculate one is there, and very fierce. Such are the ancient monasteries of Spain. Liars of terrible devotion, caverns of virgins, ferocious places.
U||Catholic Spain is more Roman than Rome herself. The Spanish convent was, above all others, the Catholic convent. There was a flavor of the Orient about it. The archbishop, the kislar-aga of heaven, locked up and kept watch over this seraglio of souls reserved for God. The nun was the odalisque, the priest was the eunuch. The fervent were chosen in dreams and possessed Christ. At night, the beautiful, nude young man descended from the cross and became the ecstasy of the cloistered one. Lofty walls guarded the mystic sultana, who had the crucified for her sultan, from all living distraction. A glance on the outer world was infidelity. The in pace replaced the leather sack. That which was cast into the sea in the East was thrown into the ground in the West. In both quarters, women wrung their hands; the waves for the first, the grave for the last; here the drowned, there the buried. Monstrous parallel.
U||To-day the upholders of the past, unable to deny these things, have adopted the expedient of smiling at them. There has come into fashion a strange and easy manner of suppressing the revelations of history, of invalidating the commentaries of philosophy, of eliding all embarrassing facts and all gloomy questions. A matter for declamations, say the clever. Declamations, repeat the foolish. Jean-Jacques a declaimer; Diderot a declaimer; Voltaire on Calas, Labarre, and Sirven, declaimers. I know not who has recently discovered that Tacitus was a declaimer, that Nero was a victim, and that pity is decidedly due to ‚Äúthat poor Holofernes.‚Äù
U||Facts, however, are awkward things to disconcert, and they are obstinate. The author of this book has seen, with his own eyes, eight leagues distant from Brussels,‚Äîthere are relics of the Middle Ages there which are attainable for everybody,‚Äîat the Abbey of Villers, the hole of the oubliettes, in the middle of the field which was formerly the courtyard of the cloister, and on the banks of the Thil, four stone dungeons, half under ground, half under the water. They were in pace. Each of these dungeons has the remains of an iron door, a vault, and a grated opening which, on the outside, is two feet above the level of the river, and on the inside, six feet above the level of the ground. Four feet of river flow past along the outside wall. The ground is always soaked. The occupant of the in pace had this wet soil for his bed. In one of these dungeons, there is a fragment of an iron necklet riveted to the wall; in another, there can be seen a square box made of four slabs of granite, too short for a person to
U|| lie down in, too low for him to stand upright in. A human being was put inside, with a coverlid of stone on top. This exists. It can be seen. It can be touched. These in pace, these dungeons, these iron hinges, these necklets, that lofty peep-hole on a level with the river‚Äôs current, that box of stone closed with a lid of granite like a tomb, with this difference, that the dead man here was a living being, that soil which is but mud, that vault hole, those oozing walls,‚Äîwhat declaimers!
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîON WHAT CONDITIONS ONE CAN RESPECT THE PAST
U||Monasticism, such as it existed in Spain, and such as it still exists in Thibet, is a sort of phthisis for civilization. It stops life short. It simply depopulates. Claustration, castration. It has been the scourge of Europe. Add to this the violence so often done to the conscience, the forced vocations, feudalism bolstered up by the cloister, the right of the first-born pouring the excess of the family into monasticism, the ferocities of which we have just spoken, the in pace, the closed mouths, the walled-up brains, so many unfortunate minds placed in the dungeon of eternal vows, the taking of the habit, the interment of living souls. Add individual tortures to national degradations, and, whoever you may be, you will shudder before the frock and the veil,‚Äîthose two winding-sheets of human devising. Nevertheless, at certain points and in certain places, in spite of philosophy, in spite of progress, the spirit of the cloister persists in the midst of the nineteenth century, and a singular ascetic recrudesc
U||ence is, at this moment, astonishing the civilized world. The obstinacy of antiquated institutions in perpetuating themselves resembles the stubbornness of the rancid perfume which should claim our hair, the pretensions of the spoiled fish which should persist in being eaten, the persecution of the child‚Äôs garment which should insist on clothing the man, the tenderness of corpses which should return to embrace the living.
U||‚ÄúIngrates!‚Äù says the garment, ‚ÄúI protected you in inclement weather. Why will you have nothing to do with me?‚Äù ‚ÄúI have just come from the deep sea,‚Äù says the fish. ‚ÄúI have been a rose,‚Äù says the perfume. ‚ÄúI have loved you,‚Äù says the corpse. ‚ÄúI have civilized you,‚Äù says the convent.
U||To this there is but one reply: ‚ÄúIn former days.‚Äù
U||To dream of the indefinite prolongation of defunct things, and of the government of men by embalming, to restore dogmas in a bad condition, to regild shrines, to patch up cloisters, to rebless reliquaries, to refurnish superstitions, to revictual fanaticisms, to put new handles on holy water brushes and militarism, to reconstitute monasticism and militarism, to believe in the salvation of society by the multiplication of parasites, to force the past on the present,‚Äîthis seems strange. Still, there are theorists who hold such theories. These theorists, who are in other respects people of intelligence, have a very simple process; they apply to the past a glazing which they call social order, divine right, morality, family, the respect of elders, antique authority, sacred tradition, legitimacy, religion; and they go about shouting, ‚ÄúLook! take this, honest people.‚Äù This logic was known to the ancients. The soothsayers practise it. They rubbed a black heifer over with chalk, and said, ‚ÄúShe is white, Bos 
U||cretatus.‚Äù
U||As for us, we respect the past here and there, and we spare it, above all, provided that it consents to be dead. If it insists on being alive, we attack it, and we try to kill it.
U||Superstitions, bigotries, affected devotion, prejudices, those forms, all forms as they are, are tenacious of life; they have teeth and nails in their smoke, and they must be clasped close, body to body, and war must be made on them, and that without truce; for it is one of the fatalities of humanity to be condemned to eternal combat with phantoms. It is difficult to seize darkness by the throat, and to hurl it to the earth.
U||A convent in France, in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century, is a college of owls facing the light. A cloister, caught in the very act of asceticism, in the very heart of the city of ‚Äô89 and of 1830 and of 1848, Rome blossoming out in Paris, is an anachronism. In ordinary times, in order to dissolve an anachronism and to cause it to vanish, one has only to make it spell out the date. But we are not in ordinary times.
U||Let us fight.
U||Let us fight, but let us make a distinction. The peculiar property of truth is never to commit excesses. What need has it of exaggeration? There is that which it is necessary to destroy, and there is that which it is simply necessary to elucidate and examine. What a force is kindly and serious examination! Let us not apply a flame where only a light is required.
U||So, given the nineteenth century, we are opposed, as a general proposition, and among all peoples, in Asia as well as in Europe, in India as well as in Turkey, to ascetic claustration. Whoever says cloister, says marsh. Their putrescence is evident, their stagnation is unhealthy, their fermentation infects people with fever, and etiolates them; their multiplication becomes a plague of Egypt. We cannot think without affright of those lands where fakirs, bonzes, santons, Greek monks, marabouts, talapoins, and dervishes multiply even like swarms of vermin.
U||This said, the religious question remains. This question has certain mysterious, almost formidable sides; may we be permitted to look at it fixedly.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîTHE CONVENT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PRINCIPLES
U||Men unite themselves and dwell in communities. By virtue of what right? By virtue of the right of association.
U||They shut themselves up at home. By virtue of what right? By virtue of the right which every man has to open or shut his door.
U||They do not come forth. By virtue of what right? By virtue of the right to go and come, which implies the right to remain at home.
U||There, at home, what do they do?
U||They speak in low tones; they drop their eyes; they toil. They renounce the world, towns, sensualities, pleasures, vanities, pride, interests. They are clothed in coarse woollen or coarse linen. Not one of them possesses in his own right anything whatever. On entering there, each one who was rich makes himself poor. What he has, he gives to all. He who was what is called noble, a gentleman and a lord, is the equal of him who was a peasant. The cell is identical for all. All undergo the same tonsure, wear the same frock, eat the same black bread, sleep on the same straw, die on the same ashes. The same sack on their backs, the same rope around their loins. If the decision has been to go barefoot, all go barefoot. There may be a prince among them; that prince is the same shadow as the rest. No titles. Even family names have disappeared. They bear only first names. All are bowed beneath the equality of baptismal names. They have dissolved the carnal family, and constituted in their community a spiritual family.
U|| They have no other relatives than all men. They succor the poor, they care for the sick. They elect those whom they obey. They call each other ‚Äúmy brother.‚Äù
U||You stop me and exclaim, ‚ÄúBut that is the ideal convent!‚Äù
U||It is sufficient that it may be the possible convent, that I should take notice of it.
U||Thence it results that, in the preceding book, I have spoken of a convent with respectful accents. The Middle Ages cast aside, Asia cast aside, the historical and political question held in reserve, from the purely philosophical point of view, outside the requirements of militant policy, on condition that the monastery shall be absolutely a voluntary matter and shall contain only consenting parties, I shall always consider a cloistered community with a certain attentive, and, in some respects, a deferential gravity.
U||Wherever there is a community, there is a commune; where there is a commune, there is right. The monastery is the product of the formula: Equality, Fraternity. Oh! how grand is liberty! And what a splendid transfiguration! Liberty suffices to transform the monastery into a republic.
U||Let us continue.
U||But these men, or these women who are behind these four walls. They dress themselves in coarse woollen, they are equals, they call each other brothers, that is well; but they do something else?
U||Yes.
U||What?
U||They gaze on the darkness, they kneel, and they clasp their hands.
U||What does this signify?
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîPRAYER
U||They pray.
U||To whom?
U||To God.
U||To pray to God,‚Äîwhat is the meaning of these words?
U||Is there an infinite beyond us? Is that infinite there, inherent, permanent; necessarily substantial, since it is infinite; and because, if it lacked matter it would be bounded; necessarily intelligent, since it is infinite, and because, if it lacked intelligence, it would end there? Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence? In other terms, is it not the absolute, of which we are only the relative?
U||At the same time that there is an infinite without us, is there not an infinite within us? Are not these two infinites (what an alarming plural!) superposed, the one upon the other? Is not this second infinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first? Is it not the latter‚Äôs mirror, reflection, echo, an abyss which is concentric with another abyss? Is this second infinity intelligent also? Does it think? Does it love? Does it will? If these two infinities are intelligent, each of them has a will principle, and there is an I in the upper infinity as there is an I in the lower infinity. The I below is the soul; the I on high is God.
U||To place the infinity here below in contact, by the medium of thought, with the infinity on high, is called praying.
U||Let us take nothing from the human mind; to suppress is bad. We must reform and transform. Certain faculties in man are directed towards the Unknown; thought, reverie, prayer. The Unknown is an ocean. What is conscience? It is the compass of the Unknown. Thought, reverie, prayer,‚Äîthese are great and mysterious radiations. Let us respect them. Whither go these majestic irradiations of the soul? Into the shadow; that is to say, to the light.
U||The grandeur of democracy is to disown nothing and to deny nothing of humanity. Close to the right of the man, beside it, at the least, there exists the right of the soul.
U||To crush fanaticism and to venerate the infinite, such is the law. Let us not confine ourselves to prostrating ourselves before the tree of creation, and to the contemplation of its branches full of stars. We have a duty to labor over the human soul, to defend the mystery against the miracle, to adore the incomprehensible and reject the absurd, to admit, as an inexplicable fact, only what is necessary, to purify belief, to remove superstitions from above religion; to clear God of caterpillars.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîTHE ABSOLUTE GOODNESS OF PRAYER
U||With regard to the modes of prayer, all are good, provided that they are sincere. Turn your book upside down and be in the infinite.
U||There is, as we know, a philosophy which denies the infinite. There is also a philosophy, pathologically classified, which denies the sun; this philosophy is called blindness.
U||To erect a sense which we lack into a source of truth, is a fine blind man‚Äôs self-sufficiency.
U||The curious thing is the haughty, superior, and compassionate airs which this groping philosophy assumes towards the philosophy which beholds God. One fancies he hears a mole crying, ‚ÄúI pity them with their sun!‚Äù
U||There are, as we know, powerful and illustrious atheists. At bottom, led back to the truth by their very force, they are not absolutely sure that they are atheists; it is with them only a question of definition, and in any case, if they do not believe in God, being great minds, they prove God.
U||We salute them as philosophers, while inexorably denouncing their philosophy.
U||Let us go on.
U||The remarkable thing about it is, also, their facility in paying themselves off with words. A metaphysical school of the North, impregnated to some extent with fog, has fancied that it has worked a revolution in human understanding by replacing the word Force with the word Will.
U||To say: ‚Äúthe plant wills,‚Äù instead of: ‚Äúthe plant grows‚Äù: this would be fecund in results, indeed, if we were to add: ‚Äúthe universe wills.‚Äù Why? Because it would come to this: the plant wills, therefore it has an I; the universe wills, therefore it has a God.
U||As for us, who, however, in contradistinction to this school, reject nothing a priori, a will in the plant, accepted by this school, appears to us more difficult to admit than a will in the universe denied by it.
U||To deny the will of the infinite, that is to say, God, is impossible on any other conditions than a denial of the infinite. We have demonstrated this.
U||The negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism. Everything becomes ‚Äúa mental conception.‚Äù
U||With nihilism, no discussion is possible; for the nihilist logic doubts the existence of its interlocutor, and is not quite sure that it exists itself.
U||From its point of view, it is possible that it may be for itself, only ‚Äúa mental conception.‚Äù
U||Only, it does not perceive that all which it has denied it admits in the lump, simply by the utterance of the word, mind.
U||In short, no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which makes all end in the monosyllable, No.
U||To No there is only one reply, Yes.
U||Nihilism has no point.
U||There is no such thing as nothingness. Zero does not exist. Everything is something. Nothing is nothing.
U||Man lives by affirmation even more than by bread.
U||Even to see and to show does not suffice. Philosophy should be an energy; it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the condition of man. Socrates should enter into Adam and produce Marcus Aurelius; in other words, the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from the man of felicity. Eden should be changed into a Lyceum. Science should be a cordial. To enjoy,‚Äîwhat a sad aim, and what a paltry ambition! The brute enjoys. To offer thought to the thirst of men, to give them all as an elixir the notion of God, to make conscience and science fraternize in them, to render them just by this mysterious confrontation; such is the function of real philosophy. Morality is a blossoming out of truths. Contemplation leads to action. The absolute should be practicable. It is necessary that the ideal should be breathable, drinkable, and eatable to the human mind. It is the ideal which has the right to say: Take, this is my body, this is my blood. Wisdom is holy communion. It is on this condition that it ceases to 
U||be a sterile love of science and becomes the one and sovereign mode of human rallying, and that philosophy herself is promoted to religion.
U||Philosophy should not be a corbel erected on mystery to gaze upon it at its ease, without any other result than that of being convenient to curiosity.
U||For our part, adjourning the development of our thought to another occasion, we will confine ourselves to saying that we neither understand man as a point of departure nor progress as an end, without those two forces which are their two motors: faith and love.
U||Progress is the goal, the ideal is the type.
U||What is this ideal? It is God.
U||Ideal, absolute, perfection, infinity: identical words.
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîPRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN BLAME
U||History and philosophy have eternal duties, which are, at the same time, simple duties; to combat Caiphas the High-priest, Draco the Lawgiver, Trimalcion the Legislator, Tiberius the Emperor; this is clear, direct, and limpid, and offers no obscurity.
U||But the right to live apart, even with its inconveniences and its abuses, insists on being stated and taken into account. Cenobitism is a human problem.
U||When one speaks of convents, those abodes of error, but of innocence, of aberration but of good-will, of ignorance but of devotion, of torture but of martyrdom, it always becomes necessary to say either yes or no.
U||A convent is a contradiction. Its object, salvation; its means thereto, sacrifice. The convent is supreme egoism having for its result supreme abnegation.
U||To abdicate with the object of reigning seems to be the device of monasticism.
U||In the cloister, one suffers in order to enjoy. One draws a bill of exchange on death. One discounts in terrestrial gloom celestial light. In the cloister, hell is accepted in advance as a post obit on paradise.
U||The taking of the veil or the frock is a suicide paid for with eternity.
U||It does not seem to us, that on such a subject mockery is permissible. All about it is serious, the good as well as the bad.
U||The just man frowns, but never smiles with a malicious sneer. We understand wrath, but not malice.
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîFAITH, LAW
U||A few words more.
U||We blame the church when she is saturated with intrigues, we despise the spiritual which is harsh toward the temporal; but we everywhere honor the thoughtful man.
U||We salute the man who kneels.
U||A faith; this is a necessity for man. Woe to him who believes nothing.
U||One is not unoccupied because one is absorbed. There is visible labor and invisible labor.
U||To contemplate is to labor, to think is to act.
U||Folded arms toil, clasped hands work. A gaze fixed on heaven is a work.
U||Thales remained motionless for four years. He founded philosophy.
U||In our opinion, cenobites are not lazy men, and recluses are not idlers.
U||To meditate on the Shadow is a serious thing.
U||Without invalidating anything that we have just said, we believe that a perpetual memory of the tomb is proper for the living. On this point, the priest and the philosopher agree. We must die. The Abb√© de la Trappe replies to Horace.
U||To mingle with one‚Äôs life a certain presence of the sepulchre,‚Äîthis is the law of the sage; and it is the law of the ascetic. In this respect, the ascetic and the sage converge. There is a material growth; we admit it. There is a moral grandeur; we hold to that. Thoughtless and vivacious spirits say:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat is the good of those motionless figures on the side of mystery? What purpose do they serve? What do they do?‚Äù
U||Alas! In the presence of the darkness which environs us, and which awaits us, in our ignorance of what the immense dispersion will make of us, we reply: ‚ÄúThere is probably no work more divine than that performed by these souls.‚Äù And we add: ‚ÄúThere is probably no work which is more useful.‚Äù
U||There certainly must be some who pray constantly for those who never pray at all.
U||In our opinion the whole question lies in the amount of thought that is mingled with prayer.
U||Leibnitz praying is grand, Voltaire adoring is fine. Deo erexit Voltaire.
U||We are for religion as against religions.
U||We are of the number who believe in the wretchedness of orisons, and the sublimity of prayer.
U||Moreover, at this minute which we are now traversing,‚Äîa minute which will not, fortunately, leave its impress on the nineteenth century,‚Äîat this hour, when so many men have low brows and souls but little elevated, among so many mortals whose morality consists in enjoyment, and who are busied with the brief and misshapen things of matter, whoever exiles himself seems worthy of veneration to us.
U||The monastery is a renunciation. Sacrifice wrongly directed is still sacrifice. To mistake a grave error for a duty has a grandeur of its own.
U||Taken by itself, and ideally, and in order to examine the truth on all sides until all aspects have been impartially exhausted, the monastery, the female convent in particular,‚Äîfor in our century it is woman who suffers the most, and in this exile of the cloister there is something of protestation,‚Äîthe female convent has incontestably a certain majesty.
U||This cloistered existence which is so austere, so depressing, a few of whose features we have just traced, is not life, for it is not liberty; it is not the tomb, for it is not plenitude; it is the strange place whence one beholds, as from the crest of a lofty mountain, on one side the abyss where we are, on the other, the abyss whither we shall go; it is the narrow and misty frontier separating two worlds, illuminated and obscured by both at the same time, where the ray of life which has become enfeebled is mingled with the vague ray of death; it is the half obscurity of the tomb.
U||We, who do not believe what these women believe, but who, like them, live by faith,‚Äîwe have never been able to think without a sort of tender and religious terror, without a sort of pity, that is full of envy, of those devoted, trembling and trusting creatures, of these humble and august souls, who dare to dwell on the very brink of the mystery, waiting between the world which is closed and heaven which is not yet open, turned towards the light which one cannot see, possessing the sole happiness of thinking that they know where it is, aspiring towards the gulf, and the unknown, their eyes fixed motionless on the darkness, kneeling, bewildered, stupefied, shuddering, half lifted, at times, by the deep breaths of eternity.
U||BOOK EIGHTH‚ÄîCEMETERIES TAKE THAT WHICH IS COMMITTED THEM
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîWHICH TREATS OF THE MANNER OF ENTERING A CONVENT
U||It was into this house that Jean Valjean had, as Fauchelevent expressed it, ‚Äúfallen from the sky.‚Äù
U||He had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the Rue Polonceau. That hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle of the night, was the nuns chanting matins; that hall, of which he had caught a glimpse in the gloom, was the chapel. That phantom which he had seen stretched on the ground was the sister who was making reparation; that bell, the sound of which had so strangely surprised him, was the gardener‚Äôs bell attached to the knee of Father Fauchelevent.
U||Cosette once put to bed, Jean Valjean and Fauchelevent had, as we have already seen, supped on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before a good, crackling fire; then, the only bed in the hut being occupied by Cosette, each threw himself on a truss of straw.
U||Before he shut his eyes, Jean Valjean said: ‚ÄúI must remain here henceforth.‚Äù This remark trotted through Fauchelevent‚Äôs head all night long.
U||To tell the truth, neither of them slept.
U||Jean Valjean, feeling that he was discovered and that Javert was on his scent, understood that he and Cosette were lost if they returned to Paris. Then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded him in this cloister. Jean Valjean had, henceforth, but one thought,‚Äîto remain there. Now, for an unfortunate man in his position, this convent was both the safest and the most dangerous of places; the most dangerous, because, as no men might enter there, if he were discovered, it was a flagrant offence, and Jean Valjean would find but one step intervening between the convent and prison; the safest, because, if he could manage to get himself accepted there and remain there, who would ever seek him in such a place? To dwell in an impossible place was safety.
U||On his side, Fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains. He began by declaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter. How had M. Madeleine got there, when the walls were what they were? Cloister walls are not to be stepped over. How did he get there with a child? One cannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in one‚Äôs arms. Who was that child? Where did they both come from? Since Fauchelevent had lived in the convent, he had heard nothing of M. sur M., and he knew nothing of what had taken place there. Father Madeleine had an air which discouraged questions; and besides, Fauchelevent said to himself: ‚ÄúOne does not question a saint.‚Äù M. Madeleine had preserved all his prestige in Fauchelevent‚Äôs eyes. Only, from some words which Jean Valjean had let fall, the gardener thought he could draw the inference that M. Madeleine had probably become bankrupt through the hard times, and that he was pursued by his creditors; or that he had compromised himself in some political affair, and was in hid
U||ing; which last did not displease Fauchelevent, who, like many of our peasants of the North, had an old fund of Bonapartism about him. While in hiding, M. Madeleine had selected the convent as a refuge, and it was quite simple that he should wish to remain there. But the inexplicable point, to which Fauchelevent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain, was that M. Madeleine should be there, and that he should have that little girl with him. Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to them, and still did not believe it possible. The incomprehensible had just made its entrance into Fauchelevent‚Äôs hut. Fauchelevent groped about amid conjectures, and could see nothing clearly but this: ‚ÄúM. Madeleine saved my life.‚Äù This certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course. He said to himself: ‚ÄúIt is my turn now.‚Äù He added in his conscience: ‚ÄúM. Madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out.‚Äù He m
U||ade up his mind to save M. Madeleine.
U||Nevertheless, he put many questions to himself and made himself divers replies: ‚ÄúAfter what he did for me, would I save him if he were a thief? Just the same. If he were an assassin, would I save him? Just the same. Since he is a saint, shall I save him? Just the same.‚Äù
U||But what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent! Fauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical undertaking; this poor peasant of Picardy without any other ladder than his self-devotion, his good will, and a little of that old rustic cunning, on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous enterprise, undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister, and the steep escarpments of the rule of Saint-Beno√Æt. Father Fauchelevent was an old man who had been an egoist all his life, and who, towards the end of his days, halt, infirm, with no interest left to him in the world, found it sweet to be grateful, and perceiving a generous action to be performed, flung himself upon it like a man, who at the moment when he is dying, should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which he had never tasted, and should swallow it with avidity. We may add, that the air which he had breathed for many years in this convent had destroyed all personality in him, and had ended b
U||y rendering a good action of some kind absolutely necessary to him.
U||So he took his resolve: to devote himself to M. Madeleine.
U||We have just called him a poor peasant of Picardy. That description is just, but incomplete. At the point of this story which we have now reached, a little of Father Fauchelevent‚Äôs physiology becomes useful. He was a peasant, but he had been a notary, which added trickery to his cunning, and penetration to his ingenuousness. Having, through various causes, failed in his business, he had descended to the calling of a carter and a laborer. But, in spite of oaths and lashings, which horses seem to require, something of the notary had lingered in him. He had some natural wit; he talked good grammar; he conversed, which is a rare thing in a village; and the other peasants said of him: ‚ÄúHe talks almost like a gentleman with a hat.‚Äù Fauchelevent belonged, in fact, to that species, which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last century qualified as demi-bourgeois, demi-lout, and which the metaphors showered by the ch√¢teau upon the thatched cottage ticketed in the pigeon-hole of the plebeian: rather
U|| rustic, rather citified; pepper and salt. Fauchelevent, though sorely tried and harshly used by fate, worn out, a sort of poor, threadbare old soul, was, nevertheless, an impulsive man, and extremely spontaneous in his actions; a precious quality which prevents one from ever being wicked. His defects and his vices, for he had some, were all superficial; in short, his physiognomy was of the kind which succeeds with an observer. His aged face had none of those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead, which signify malice or stupidity.
U||At daybreak, Father Fauchelevent opened his eyes, after having done an enormous deal of thinking, and beheld M. Madeleine seated on his truss of straw, and watching Cosette‚Äôs slumbers. Fauchelevent sat up and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúNow that you are here, how are you going to contrive to enter?‚Äù
U||This remark summed up the situation and aroused Jean Valjean from his reverie.
U||The two men took counsel together.
U||‚ÄúIn the first place,‚Äù said Fauchelevent, ‚Äúyou will begin by not setting foot outside of this chamber, either you or the child. One step in the garden and we are done for.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is true.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Madeleine,‚Äù resumed Fauchelevent, ‚Äúyou have arrived at a very auspicious moment, I mean to say a very inauspicious moment; one of the ladies is very ill. This will prevent them from looking much in our direction. It seems that she is dying. The prayers of the forty hours are being said. The whole community is in confusion. That occupies them. The one who is on the point of departure is a saint. In fact, we are all saints here; all the difference between them and me is that they say ‚Äòour cell,‚Äô and that I say ‚Äòmy cabin.‚Äô The prayers for the dying are to be said, and then the prayers for the dead. We shall be at peace here for to-day; but I will not answer for to-morrow.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúStill,‚Äù observed Jean Valjean, ‚Äúthis cottage is in the niche of the wall, it is hidden by a sort of ruin, there are trees, it is not visible from the convent.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd I add that the nuns never come near it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù said Jean Valjean.
U||The interrogation mark which accentuated this ‚Äúwell‚Äù signified: ‚Äúit seems to me that one may remain concealed here?‚Äù It was to this interrogation point that Fauchelevent responded:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThere are the little girls.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat little girls?‚Äù asked Jean Valjean.
U||Just as Fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had uttered, a bell emitted one stroke.
U||‚ÄúThe nun is dead,‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúThere is the knell.‚Äù
U||And he made a sign to Jean Valjean to listen.
U||The bell struck a second time.
U||‚ÄúIt is the knell, Monsieur Madeleine. The bell will continue to strike once a minute for twenty-four hours, until the body is taken from the church.‚ÄîYou see, they play. At recreation hours it suffices to have a ball roll aside, to send them all hither, in spite of prohibitions, to hunt and rummage for it all about here. Those cherubs are devils.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWho?‚Äù asked Jean Valjean.
U||‚ÄúThe little girls. You would be very quickly discovered. They would shriek: ‚ÄòOh! a man!‚Äô There is no danger to-day. There will be no recreation hour. The day will be entirely devoted to prayers. You hear the bell. As I told you, a stroke each minute. It is the death knell.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI understand, Father Fauchelevent. There are pupils.‚Äù
U||And Jean Valjean thought to himself:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHere is Cosette‚Äôs education already provided.‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúPardine! There are little girls indeed! And they would bawl around you! And they would rush off! To be a man here is to have the plague. You see how they fasten a bell to my paw as though I were a wild beast.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean fell into more and more profound thought.‚Äî‚ÄúThis convent would be our salvation,‚Äù he murmured.
U||Then he raised his voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYes, the difficulty is to remain here.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Fauchelevent, ‚Äúthe difficulty is to get out.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart.
U||‚ÄúTo get out!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, Monsieur Madeleine. In order to return here it is first necessary to get out.‚Äù
U||And after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded, Fauchelevent went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou must not be found here in this fashion. Whence come you? For me, you fall from heaven, because I know you; but the nuns require one to enter by the door.‚Äù
U||All at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell.
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù said Fauchelevent, ‚Äúthey are ringing up the vocal mothers. They are going to the chapter. They always hold a chapter when any one dies. She died at daybreak. People generally do die at daybreak. But cannot you get out by the way in which you entered? Come, I do not ask for the sake of questioning you, but how did you get in?‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean turned pale; the very thought of descending again into that terrible street made him shudder. You make your way out of a forest filled with tigers, and once out of it, imagine a friendly counsel that shall advise you to return thither! Jean Valjean pictured to himself the whole police force still engaged in swarming in that quarter, agents on the watch, sentinels everywhere, frightful fists extended towards his collar, Javert at the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps.
U||‚ÄúImpossible!‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúFather Fauchelevent, say that I fell from the sky.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut I believe it, I believe it,‚Äù retorted Fauchelevent. ‚ÄúYou have no need to tell me that. The good God must have taken you in his hand for the purpose of getting a good look at you close to, and then dropped you. Only, he meant to place you in a man‚Äôs convent; he made a mistake. Come, there goes another peal, that is to order the porter to go and inform the municipality that the dead-doctor is to come here and view a corpse. All that is the ceremony of dying. These good ladies are not at all fond of that visit. A doctor is a man who does not believe in anything. He lifts the veil. Sometimes he lifts something else too. How quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time! What is the matter? Your little one is still asleep. What is her name?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCosette.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe is your daughter? You are her grandfather, that is?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt will be easy enough for her to get out of here. I have my service door which opens on the courtyard. I knock. The porter opens; I have my vintage basket on my back, the child is in it, I go out. Father Fauchelevent goes out with his basket‚Äîthat is perfectly natural. You will tell the child to keep very quiet. She will be under the cover. I will leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friend, a fruit-seller whom I know in the Rue Chemin-Vert, who is deaf, and who has a little bed. I will shout in the fruit-seller‚Äôs ear, that she is a niece of mine, and that she is to keep her for me until to-morrow. Then the little one will re-enter with you; for I will contrive to have you re-enter. It must be done. But how will you manage to get out?‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean shook his head.
U||‚ÄúNo one must see me, the whole point lies there, Father Fauchelevent. Find some means of getting me out in a basket, under cover, like Cosette.‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of his left hand, a sign of serious embarrassment.
U||A third peal created a diversion.
U||‚ÄúThat is the dead-doctor taking his departure,‚Äù said Fauchelevent. ‚ÄúHe has taken a look and said: ‚ÄòShe is dead, that is well.‚Äô When the doctor has signed the passport for paradise, the undertaker‚Äôs company sends a coffin. If it is a mother, the mothers lay her out; if she is a sister, the sisters lay her out. After which, I nail her up. That forms a part of my gardener‚Äôs duty. A gardener is a bit of a grave-digger. She is placed in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the street, and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead. I don‚Äôt count the undertaker‚Äôs men and myself as men. It is in that hall that I nail up the coffin. The undertaker‚Äôs men come and get it, and whip up, coachman! that‚Äôs the way one goes to heaven. They fetch a box with nothing in it, they take it away again with something in it. That‚Äôs what a burial is like. De profundis.‚Äù
U||A horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping Cosette, who lay with her mouth vaguely open, and had the air of an angel drinking in the light. Jean Valjean had fallen to gazing at her. He was no longer listening to Fauchelevent.
U||That one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence. The good old gardener went on tranquilly with his babble:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe grave is dug in the Vaugirard cemetery. They declare that they are going to suppress that Vaugirard cemetery. It is an ancient cemetery which is outside the regulations, which has no uniform, and which is going to retire. It is a shame, for it is convenient. I have a friend there, Father Mestienne, the grave-digger. The nuns here possess one privilege, it is to be taken to that cemetery at nightfall. There is a special permission from the Prefecture on their behalf. But how many events have happened since yesterday! Mother Crucifixion is dead, and Father Madeleine‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIs buried,‚Äù said Jean Valjean, smiling sadly.
U||Fauchelevent caught the word.
U||‚ÄúGoodness! if you were here for good, it would be a real burial.‚Äù
U||A fourth peal burst out. Fauchelevent hastily detached the belled knee-cap from its nail and buckled it on his knee again.
U||‚ÄúThis time it is for me. The Mother Prioress wants me. Good, now I am pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle. Monsieur Madeleine, don‚Äôt stir from here, and wait for me. Something new has come up. If you are hungry, there is wine, bread and cheese.‚Äù
U||And he hastened out of the hut, crying: ‚ÄúComing! coming!‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his crooked leg would permit, casting a sidelong glance by the way on his melon patch.
U||Less than ten minutes later, Father Fauchelevent, whose bell put the nuns in his road to flight, tapped gently at a door, and a gentle voice replied: ‚ÄúForever! Forever!‚Äù that is to say: ‚ÄúEnter.‚Äù
U||The door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the gardener on business. This parlor adjoined the chapter hall. The prioress, seated on the only chair in the parlor, was waiting for Fauchelevent.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîFAUCHELEVENT IN THE PRESENCE OF A DIFFICULTY
U||It is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions, notably priests and nuns, to wear a grave and agitated air on critical occasions. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, this double form of preoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress, who was that wise and charming Mademoiselle de Blemeur, Mother Innocente, who was ordinarily cheerful.
U||The gardener made a timid bow, and remained at the door of the cell. The prioress, who was telling her beads, raised her eyes and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAh! it is you, Father Fauvent.‚Äù
U||This abbreviation had been adopted in the convent.
U||Fauchelevent bowed again.
U||‚ÄúFather Fauvent, I have sent for you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHere I am, reverend Mother.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have something to say to you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd so have I,‚Äù said Fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him inward terror, ‚ÄúI have something to say to the very reverend Mother.‚Äù
U||The prioress stared at him.
U||‚ÄúAh! you have a communication to make to me.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA request.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúVery well, speak.‚Äù
U||Goodman Fauchelevent, the ex-notary, belonged to the category of peasants who have assurance. A certain clever ignorance constitutes a force; you do not distrust it, and you are caught by it. Fauchelevent had been a success during the something more than two years which he had passed in the convent. Always solitary and busied about his gardening, he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity. As he was at a distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro, he saw before him only an agitation of shadows. By dint of attention and sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh, and those corpses were alive for him. He was like a deaf man whose sight grows keener, and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more acute. He had applied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals, and he had succeeded, so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloister possessed no secrets for him; the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear. Fauchelevent knew all and conceale
U||d all; that constituted his art. The whole convent thought him stupid. A great merit in religion. The vocal mothers made much of Fauchelevent. He was a curious mute. He inspired confidence. Moreover, he was regular, and never went out except for well-demonstrated requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden. This discretion of conduct had inured to his credit. Nonetheless, he had set two men to chattering: the porter, in the convent, and he knew the singularities of their parlor, and the grave-digger, at the cemetery, and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their sepulture; in this way, he possessed a double light on the subject of these nuns, one as to their life, the other as to their death. But he did not abuse his knowledge. The congregation thought a great deal of him. Old, lame, blind to everything, probably a little deaf into the bargain,‚Äîwhat qualities! They would have found it difficult to replace him.
U||The goodman, with the assurance of a person who feels that he is appreciated, entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue to the reverend prioress. He talked a long time about his age, his infirmities, the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth, of the increasing demands of his work, of the great size of the garden, of nights which must be passed, like the last, for instance, when he had been obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds, because of the moon, and he wound up as follows: ‚ÄúThat he had a brother‚Äù‚Äî(the prioress made a movement),‚Äî‚Äúa brother no longer young‚Äù‚Äî(a second movement on the part of the prioress, but one expressive of reassurance),‚Äî‚Äúthat, if he might be permitted, this brother would come and live with him and help him, that he was an excellent gardener, that the community would receive from him good service, better than his own; that, otherwise, if his brother were not admitted, as he, the elder, felt that his health was broken and that he 
U||was insufficient for the work, he should be obliged, greatly to his regret, to go away; and that his brother had a little daughter whom he would bring with him, who might be reared for God in the house, and who might, who knows, become a nun some day.‚Äù
U||When he had finished speaking, the prioress stayed the slipping of her rosary between her fingers, and said to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCould you procure a stout iron bar between now and this evening?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFor what purpose?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo serve as a lever.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, reverend Mother,‚Äù replied Fauchelevent.
U||The prioress, without adding a word, rose and entered the adjoining room, which was the hall of the chapter, and where the vocal mothers were probably assembled. Fauchelevent was left alone.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîMOTHER INNOCENTE
U||About a quarter of an hour elapsed. The prioress returned and seated herself once more on her chair.
U||The two interlocutors seemed preoccupied. We will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued, to the best of our ability.
U||‚ÄúFather Fauvent!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúReverend Mother!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDo you know the chapel?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have a little cage there, where I hear the mass and the offices.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTwo or three times.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThere is a stone to be raised.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHeavy?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe slab which closes the vault?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt would be a good thing to have two men for it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMother Ascension, who is as strong as a man, will help you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA woman is never a man.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWe have only a woman here to help you. Each one does what he can. Because Dom Mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of Saint Bernard, while Merlonus Horstius only gives three hundred and sixty-seven, I do not despise Merlonus Horstius.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNeither do I.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMerit consists in working according to one‚Äôs strength. A cloister is not a dock-yard.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd a woman is not a man. But my brother is the strong one, though!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd can you get a lever?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThere is a ring in the stone.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will put the lever through it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is good, reverend Mother. I will open the vault.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd the four Mother Precentors will help you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd when the vault is open?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt must be closed again.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWill that be all?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGive me your orders, very reverend Mother.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFauvent, we have confidence in you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am here to do anything you wish.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd to hold your peace about everything!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, reverend Mother.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhen the vault is open‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will close it again.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut before that‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat, reverend Mother?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSomething must be lowered into it.‚Äù
U||A silence ensued. The prioress, after a pout of the under lip which resembled hesitation, broke it.
U||‚ÄúFather Fauvent!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúReverend Mother!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou know that a mother died this morning?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDid you not hear the bell?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúReally?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI can hardly distinguish my own signal.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe died at daybreak.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd then, the wind did not blow in my direction this morning.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt was Mother Crucifixion. A blessed woman.‚Äù
U||The prioress paused, moved her lips, as though in mental prayer, and resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThree years ago, Madame de B√©thune, a Jansenist, turned orthodox, merely from having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh! yes, now I hear the knell, reverend Mother.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe mothers have taken her to the dead-room, which opens on the church.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI know.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo other man than you can or must enter that chamber. See to that. A fine sight it would be, to see a man enter the dead-room!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMore often!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHey?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMore often!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat do you say?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI say more often.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMore often than what?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúReverend Mother, I did not say more often than what, I said more often.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand you. Why do you say more often?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn order to speak like you, reverend Mother.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut I did not say ‚Äòmore often.‚Äô‚Äù
U||At that moment, nine o‚Äôclock struck.
U||‚ÄúAt nine o‚Äôclock in the morning and at all hours, praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar,‚Äù said the prioress.
U||‚ÄúAmen,‚Äù said Fauchelevent.
U||The clock struck opportunely. It cut ‚Äúmore often‚Äù short. It is probable, that had it not been for this, the prioress and Fauchelevent would never have unravelled that skein.
U||Fauchelevent mopped his forehead.
U||The prioress indulged in another little inward murmur, probably sacred, then raised her voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIn her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts; after her death, she will perform miracles.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe will!‚Äù replied Father Fauchelevent, falling into step, and striving not to flinch again.
U||‚ÄúFather Fauvent, the community has been blessed in Mother Crucifixion. No doubt, it is not granted to every one to die, like Cardinal de B√©rulle, while saying the holy mass, and to breathe forth their souls to God, while pronouncing these words: Hanc igitur oblationem. But without attaining to such happiness, Mother Crucifixion‚Äôs death was very precious. She retained her consciousness to the very last moment. She spoke to us, then she spoke to the angels. She gave us her last commands. If you had a little more faith, and if you could have been in her cell, she would have cured your leg merely by touching it. She smiled. We felt that she was regaining her life in God. There was something of paradise in that death.‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing.
U||‚ÄúAmen,‚Äù said he.
U||‚ÄúFather Fauvent, what the dead wish must be done.‚Äù
U||The prioress took off several beads of her chaplet. Fauchelevent held his peace.
U||She went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in Our Lord, who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life, and who bear wonderful fruit.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúReverend Mother, you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBesides, she is more than a dead woman, she is a saint.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúLike yourself, reverend Mother.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe slept in her coffin for twenty years, by express permission of our Holy Father, Pius VII.‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe one who crowned the Emp‚ÄîBuonaparte.‚Äù
U||For a clever man like Fauchelevent, this allusion was an awkward one. Fortunately, the prioress, completely absorbed in her own thoughts, did not hear it. She continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFather Fauvent?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúReverend Mother?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSaint Didorus, Archbishop of Cappadocia, desired that this single word might be inscribed on his tomb: Acarus, which signifies, a worm of the earth; this was done. Is this true?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, reverend Mother.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe blessed Mezzocane, Abbot of Aquila, wished to be buried beneath the gallows; this was done.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is true.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSaint Terentius, Bishop of Port, where the mouth of the Tiber empties into the sea, requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides, in the hope that passers-by would spit on his tomb. This was done. The dead must be obeyed.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSo be it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe body of Bernard Guidonis, born in France near Roche-Abeille, was, as he had ordered, and in spite of the king of Castile, borne to the church of the Dominicans in Limoges, although Bernard Guidonis was Bishop of Tuy in Spain. Can the contrary be affirmed?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFor that matter, no, reverend Mother.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe fact is attested by Plantavit de la Fosse.‚Äù
U||Several beads of the chaplet were told off, still in silence. The prioress resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFather Fauvent, Mother Crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is just.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt is a continuation of her slumber.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSo I shall have to nail up that coffin?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd we are to reject the undertaker‚Äôs coffin?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPrecisely.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am at the orders of the very reverend community.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe four Mother Precentors will assist you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn nailing up the coffin? I do not need them.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo. In lowering the coffin.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúInto the vault.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat vault?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúUnder the altar.‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent started.
U||‚ÄúThe vault under the altar?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúUnder the altar.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou will have an iron bar.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, but‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe dead must be obeyed. To be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel, not to go to profane earth; to remain there in death where she prayed while living; such was the last wish of Mother Crucifixion. She asked it of us; that is to say, commanded us.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut it is forbidden.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúForbidden by men, enjoined by God.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat if it became known?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWe have confidence in you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOh! I am a stone in your walls.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe chapter assembled. The vocal mothers, whom I have just consulted again, and who are now deliberating, have decided that Mother Crucifixion shall be buried, according to her wish, in her own coffin, under our altar. Think, Father Fauvent, if she were to work miracles here! What a glory of God for the community! And miracles issue from tombs.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut, reverend Mother, if the agent of the sanitary commission‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSaint Beno√Æt II., in the matter of sepulture, resisted Constantine Pogonatus.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut the commissary of police‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúChonodemaire, one of the seven German kings who entered among the Gauls under the Empire of Constantius, expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion, that is to say, beneath the altar.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut the inspector from the Prefecture‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe world is nothing in the presence of the cross. Martin, the eleventh general of the Carthusians, gave to his order this device: Stat crux dum volvitur orbis.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAmen,‚Äù said Fauchelevent, who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma, whenever he heard Latin.
U||Any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long. On the day when the rhetorician Gymnastoras left his prison, bearing in his body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in, he halted in front of the first tree which he came to, harangued it and made very great efforts to convince it. The prioress, who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence, and whose reservoir was overfull, rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI have on my right Beno√Æt and on my left Bernard. Who was Bernard? The first abbot of Clairvaux. Fontaines in Burgundy is a country that is blest because it gave him birth. His father was named T√©celin, and his mother Al√®the. He began at C√Æteaux, to end in Clairvaux; he was ordained abbot by the bishop of Ch√¢lon-sur-Sa√¥ne, Guillaume de Champeaux; he had seven hundred novices, and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries; he overthrew Abeilard at the council of Sens in 1140, and Pierre de Bruys and Henry his disciple, and another sort of erring spirits who were called the Apostolics; he confounded Arnauld de Brescia, darted lightning at the monk Raoul, the murderer of the Jews, dominated the council of Reims in 1148, caused the condemnation of Gilbert de Por√©a, Bishop of Poitiers, caused the condemnation of √âon de l‚Äô√âtoile, arranged the disputes of princes, enlightened King Louis the Young, advised Pope Eugene III., regulated the Temple, preached the crusade, performed two hundred and fifty mirac
U||les during his lifetime, and as many as thirty-nine in one day. Who was Beno√Æt? He was the patriarch of Mont-Cassin; he was the second founder of the Saintet√© Claustrale, he was the Basil of the West. His order has produced forty popes, two hundred cardinals, fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred archbishops, four thousand six hundred bishops, four emperors, twelve empresses, forty-six kings, forty-one queens, three thousand six hundred canonized saints, and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years. On one side Saint Bernard, on the other the agent of the sanitary department! On one side Saint Beno√Æt, on the other the inspector of public ways! The state, the road commissioners, the public undertaker, regulations, the administration, what do we know of all that? There is not a chance passer-by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated. We have not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ! Your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention. God subordinated to the commissary of poli
U||ce; such is the age. Silence, Fauvent!‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath. The prioress continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúNo one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture. Only fanatics and those in error deny it. We live in times of terrible confusion. We do not know that which it is necessary to know, and we know that which we should ignore. We are ignorant and impious. In this age there exist people who do not distinguish between the very great Saint Bernard and the Saint Bernard denominated of the poor Catholics, a certain good ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century. Others are so blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of Louis XVI. to the cross of Jesus Christ. Louis XVI. was merely a king. Let us beware of God! There is no longer just nor unjust. The name of Voltaire is known, but not the name of C√©sar de Bus. Nevertheless, C√©sar de Bus is a man of blessed memory, and Voltaire one of unblessed memory. The last arch-bishop, the Cardinal de P√©rigord, did not even know that Charles de Gondren succeeded to Berulle, and Fran√ßois Bourgoin to Gondren, and Jean-Fran√ßois Senault to Bourgoin, and Father Saint
U||e-Marthe to Jean-Fran√ßois Senault. The name of Father Coton is known, not because he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the Oratorie, but because he furnished Henri IV., the Huguenot king, with the material for an oath. That which pleases people of the world in Saint Fran√ßois de Sales, is that he cheated at play. And then, religion is attacked. Why? Because there have been bad priests, because Sagittaire, Bishop of Gap, was the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and because both of them followed Mommol. What has that to do with the question? Does that prevent Martin de Tours from being a saint, and giving half of his cloak to a beggar? They persecute the saints. They shut their eyes to the truth. Darkness is the rule. The most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind. No one thinks of hell as a reality. Oh! how wicked people are! By order of the king signifies to-day, by order of the revolution. One no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead. A holy death is prohibited. Bur
U||ial is a civil matter. This is horrible. Saint Leo II. wrote two special letters, one to Pierre Notaire, the other to the king of the Visigoths, for the purpose of combating and rejecting, in questions touching the dead, the authority of the exarch and the supremacy of the Emperor. Gauthier, Bishop of Ch√¢lons, held his own in this matter against Otho, Duke of Burgundy. The ancient magistracy agreed with him. In former times we had voices in the chapter, even on matters of the day. The Abbot of C√Æteaux, the general of the order, was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of Burgundy. We do what we please with our dead. Is not the body of Saint Beno√Æt himself in France, in the abbey of Fleury, called Saint Beno√Æt-sur-Loire, although he died in Italy at Mont-Cassin, on Saturday, the 21st of the month of March, of the year 543? All this is incontestable. I abhor psalm-singers, I hate priors, I execrate heretics, but I should detest yet more any one who should maintain the contrary. One has only to re
U||ad Arnoul Wion, Gabriel Bucelin, Trithemus, Maurolics, and Dom Luc d‚ÄôAchery.‚Äù
U||The prioress took breath, then turned to Fauchelevent.
U||‚ÄúIs it settled, Father Fauvent?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt is settled, reverend Mother.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWe may depend on you?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will obey.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is well.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am entirely devoted to the convent.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is understood. You will close the coffin. The sisters will carry it to the chapel. The office for the dead will then be said. Then we shall return to the cloister. Between eleven o‚Äôclock and midnight, you will come with your iron bar. All will be done in the most profound secrecy. There will be in the chapel only the four Mother Precentors, Mother Ascension and yourself.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd the sister at the post?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe will not turn round.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut she will hear.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe will not listen. Besides, what the cloister knows the world learns not.‚Äù
U||A pause ensued. The prioress went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou will remove your bell. It is not necessary that the sister at the post should perceive your presence.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúReverend Mother?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat, Father Fauvent?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHas the doctor for the dead paid his visit?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe will pay it at four o‚Äôclock to-day. The peal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung. But you do not understand any of the peals?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI pay no attention to any but my own.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is well, Father Fauvent.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúReverend Mother, a lever at least six feet long will be required.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhere will you obtain it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhere gratings are not lacking, iron bars are not lacking. I have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAbout three-quarters of an hour before midnight; do not forget.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúReverend Mother?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIf you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort, my brother is the strong man for you. A perfect Turk!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou will do it as speedily as possible.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI cannot work very fast. I am infirm; that is why I require an assistant. I limp.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo limp is no sin, and perhaps it is a blessing. The Emperor Henry II., who combated Antipope Gregory and re-established Beno√Æt VIII., has two surnames, the Saint and the Lame.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTwo surtouts are a good thing,‚Äù murmured Fauchelevent, who really was a little hard of hearing.
U||‚ÄúNow that I think of it, Father Fauvent, let us give a whole hour to it. That is not too much. Be near the principal altar, with your iron bar, at eleven o‚Äôclock. The office begins at midnight. Everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community. These are my orders. I am to nail up the coffin. At eleven o‚Äôclock exactly, I am to be in the chapel. The Mother Precentors will be there. Mother Ascension will be there. Two men would be better. However, never mind! I shall have my lever. We will open the vault, we will lower the coffin, and we will close the vault again. After which, there will be no trace of anything. The government will have no suspicion. Thus all has been arranged, reverend Mother?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat else remains?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe empty coffin remains.‚Äù
U||This produced a pause. Fauchelevent meditated. The prioress meditated.
U||‚ÄúWhat is to be done with that coffin, Father Fauvent?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt will be given to the earth.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúEmpty?‚Äù
U||Another silence. Fauchelevent made, with his left hand, that sort of a gesture which dismisses a troublesome subject.
U||‚ÄúReverend Mother, I am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the basement of the church, and no one can enter there but myself, and I will cover the coffin with the pall.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, but the bearers, when they place it in the hearse and lower it into the grave, will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh! the de‚Äî!‚Äù exclaimed Fauchelevent.
U||The prioress began to make the sign of the cross, and looked fixedly at the gardener. The vil stuck fast in his throat.
U||He made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath.
U||‚ÄúI will put earth in the coffin, reverend Mother. That will produce the effect of a corpse.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are right. Earth, that is the same thing as man. So you will manage the empty coffin?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will make that my special business.‚Äù
U||The prioress‚Äôs face, up to that moment troubled and clouded, grew serene once more. She made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to him. Fauchelevent went towards the door. As he was on the point of passing out, the prioress raised her voice gently:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am pleased with you, Father Fauvent; bring your brother to me to-morrow, after the burial, and tell him to fetch his daughter.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîIN WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAS QUITE THE AIR OF HAVING READ AUSTIN CASTILLEJO
U||The strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one-eyed man; they do not reach their goal very promptly. Moreover, Fauchelevent was in a dilemma. He took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his cottage in the garden. Cosette had waked up. Jean Valjean had placed her near the fire. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, Jean Valjean was pointing out to her the vintner‚Äôs basket on the wall, and saying to her, ‚ÄúListen attentively to me, my little Cosette. We must go away from this house, but we shall return to it, and we shall be very happy here. The good man who lives here is going to carry you off on his back in that. You will wait for me at a lady‚Äôs house. I shall come to fetch you. Obey, and say nothing, above all things, unless you want Madame Th√©nardier to get you again!‚Äù
U||Cosette nodded gravely.
U||Jean Valjean turned round at the noise made by Fauchelevent opening the door.
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúEverything is arranged, and nothing is,‚Äù said Fauchelevent. ‚ÄúI have permission to bring you in; but before bringing you in you must be got out. That‚Äôs where the difficulty lies. It is easy enough with the child.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou will carry her out?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd she will hold her tongue?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI answer for that.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut you, Father Madeleine?‚Äù
U||And, after a silence, fraught with anxiety, Fauchelevent exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhy, get out as you came in!‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean, as in the first instance, contented himself with saying, ‚ÄúImpossible.‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent grumbled, more to himself than to Jean Valjean:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThere is another thing which bothers me. I have said that I would put earth in it. When I come to think it over, the earth instead of the corpse will not seem like the real thing, it won‚Äôt do, it will get displaced, it will move about. The men will bear it. You understand, Father Madeleine, the government will notice it.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving.
U||Fauchelevent went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHow the de‚Äîuce are you going to get out? It must all be done by to-morrow morning. It is to-morrow that I am to bring you in. The prioress expects you.‚Äù
U||Then he explained to Jean Valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he, Fauchelevent, was to render to the community. That it fell among his duties to take part in their burials, that he nailed up the coffins and helped the grave-digger at the cemetery. That the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed, and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel. That the police regulations forbade this, but that she was one of those dead to whom nothing is refused. That the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased. That it was so much the worse for the government. That he, Fauchelevent, was to nail up the coffin in the cell, raise the stone in the chapel, and lower the corpse into the vault. And that, by way of thanks, the prioress was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener, and his niece as a pupil. That his brother was M. Madeleine, and that his niece was Cosette. That the prioress had told h
U||im to bring his brother on the following evening, after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery. But that he could not bring M. Madeleine in from the outside if M. Madeleine was not outside. That that was the first problem. And then, that there was another: the empty coffin.
U||‚ÄúWhat is that empty coffin?‚Äù asked Jean Valjean.
U||Fauchelevent replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe coffin of the administration.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat coffin? What administration?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA nun dies. The municipal doctor comes and says, ‚ÄòA nun has died.‚Äô The government sends a coffin. The next day it sends a hearse and undertaker‚Äôs men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery. The undertaker‚Äôs men will come and lift the coffin; there will be nothing in it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPut something in it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA corpse? I have none.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat then?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA living person.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat person?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMe!‚Äù said Jean Valjean.
U||Fauchelevent, who was seated, sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair.
U||‚ÄúYou!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up his face like a flash from heaven in the winter.
U||‚ÄúYou know, Fauchelevent, what you have said: ‚ÄòMother Crucifixion is dead.‚Äô and I add: ‚Äòand Father Madeleine is buried.‚Äô‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh! good, you can laugh, you are not speaking seriously.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúVery seriously, I must get out of this place.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCertainly.‚Äù
U||‚Äúl have told you to find a basket, and a cover for me also.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe basket will be of pine, and the cover a black cloth.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn the first place, it will be a white cloth. Nuns are buried in white.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúLet it be a white cloth, then.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are not like other men, Father Madeleine.‚Äù
U||To behold such devices, which are nothing else than the savage and daring inventions of the galleys, spring forth from the peaceable things which surrounded him, and mingle with what he called the ‚Äúpetty course of life in the convent,‚Äù caused Fauchelevent as much amazement as a gull fishing in the gutter of the Rue Saint-Denis would inspire in a passer-by.
U||Jean Valjean went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe problem is to get out of here without being seen. This offers the means. But give me some information, in the first place. How is it managed? Where is this coffin?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe empty one?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDownstairs, in what is called the dead-room. It stands on two trestles, under the pall.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHow long is the coffin?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSix feet.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is this dead-room?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden, which is closed on the outside by a shutter, and two doors; one leads into the convent, the other into the church.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat church?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe church in the street, the church which any one can enter.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHave you the keys to those two doors?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent; the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhen does the porter open that door?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOnly to allow the undertaker‚Äôs men to enter, when they come to get the coffin. When the coffin has been taken out, the door is closed again.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWho nails up the coffin?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI do.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWho spreads the pall over it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI do.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAre you alone?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNot another man, except the police doctor, can enter the dead-room. That is even written on the wall.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCould you hide me in that room to-night when every one is asleep?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo. But I could hide you in a small, dark nook which opens on the dead-room, where I keep my tools to use for burials, and of which I have the key.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAt what time will the hearse come for the coffin to-morrow?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAbout three o‚Äôclock in the afternoon. The burial will take place at the Vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall. It is not very near.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will remain concealed in your tool-closet all night and all the morning. And how about food? I shall be hungry.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will bring you something.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o‚Äôclock.‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger-joints.
U||‚ÄúBut that is impossible!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBah! Impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank?‚Äù
U||What seemed unprecedented to Fauchelevent was, we repeat, a simple matter to Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean had been in worse straits than this. Any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape. The prisoner is subject to flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him. An escape is a cure. What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure? To have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods, to live for a long time in a box, to find air where there is none, to economize his breath for hours, to know how to stifle without dying‚Äîthis was one of Jean Valjean‚Äôs gloomy talents.
U||Moreover, a coffin containing a living being,‚Äîthat convict‚Äôs expedient,‚Äîis also an imperial expedient. If we are to credit the monk Austin Castillejo, this was the means employed by Charles the Fifth, desirous of seeing the Plombes for the last time after his abdication.
U||He had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of Saint-Yuste in this manner.
U||Fauchelevent, who had recovered himself a little, exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBut how will you manage to breathe?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will breathe.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn that box! The mere thought of it suffocates me.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou surely must have a gimlet, you will make a few holes here and there, around my mouth, and you will nail the top plank on loosely.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGood! And what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze.‚Äù
U||And Jean Valjean added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFather Fauchelevent, we must come to a decision: I must either be caught here, or accept this escape through the hearse.‚Äù
U||Every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging between the two leaves of a half-shut door. Who is there who has not said to a cat, ‚ÄúDo come in!‚Äù There are men who, when an incident stands half-open before them, have the same tendency to halt in indecision between two resolutions, at the risk of getting crushed through the abrupt closing of the adventure by fate. The over-prudent, cats as they are, and because they are cats, sometimes incur more danger than the audacious. Fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature. But Jean Valjean‚Äôs coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself. He grumbled:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWell, since there is no other means.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe only thing which troubles me is what will take place at the cemetery.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is the very point that is not troublesome,‚Äù exclaimed Fauchelevent. ‚ÄúIf you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right, I am sure of getting you out of the grave. The grave-digger is a drunkard, and a friend of mine. He is Father Mestienne. An old fellow of the old school. The grave-digger puts the corpses in the grave, and I put the grave-digger in my pocket. I will tell you what will take place. They will arrive a little before dusk, three-quarters of an hour before the gates of the cemetery are closed. The hearse will drive directly up to the grave. I shall follow; that is my business. I shall have a hammer, a chisel, and some pincers in my pocket. The hearse halts, the undertaker‚Äôs men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down. The priest says the prayers, makes the sign of the cross, sprinkles the holy water, and takes his departure. I am left alone with Father Mestienne. He is my friend, I tell you. One of two things will happen, he will either be sober, or he will not be sobe
U||r. If he is not drunk, I shall say to him: ‚ÄòCome and drink a bout while the Bon Coing [the Good Quince] is open.‚Äô I carry him off, I get him drunk,‚Äîit does not take long to make Father Mestienne drunk, he always has the beginning of it about him,‚ÄîI lay him under the table, I take his card, so that I can get into the cemetery again, and I return without him. Then you have no longer any one but me to deal with. If he is drunk, I shall say to him: ‚ÄòBe off; I will do your work for you.‚Äô Off he goes, and I drag you out of the hole.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean held out his hand, and Fauchelevent precipitated himself upon it with the touching effusion of a peasant.
U||‚ÄúThat is settled, Father Fauchelevent. All will go well.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúProvided nothing goes wrong,‚Äù thought Fauchelevent. ‚ÄúIn that case, it would be terrible.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîIT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BE DRUNK IN ORDER TO BE IMMORTAL
U||On the following day, as the sun was declining, the very rare passers-by on the Boulevard du Maine pulled off their hats to an old-fashioned hearse, ornamented with skulls, cross-bones, and tears. This hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross, like a huge corpse with drooping arms. A mourning-coach, in which could be seen a priest in his surplice, and a choir boy in his red cap, followed. Two undertaker‚Äôs men in gray uniforms trimmed with black walked on the right and the left of the hearse. Behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer, who limped along. The procession was going in the direction of the Vaugirard cemetery.
U||The handle of a hammer, the blade of a cold chisel, and the antenn√¶ of a pair of pincers were visible, protruding from the man‚Äôs pocket.
U||The Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of Paris. It had its peculiar usages, just as it had its carriage entrance and its house door, which old people in the quarter, who clung tenaciously to ancient words, still called the porte cavali√®re and the porte pi√©tonne.16 The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Rue Petit-Picpus had obtained permission, as we have already stated, to be buried there in a corner apart, and at night, the plot of land having formerly belonged to their community. The grave-diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter, in this cemetery, they were subjected to a special discipline. The gates of the Paris cemeteries closed, at that epoch, at sundown, and this being a municipal regulation, the Vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the rest. The carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous grated gates, adjoining a pavilion built by the architect Perronet, and inhabited by the door-keeper of the cemetery. These gates, the
U||refore, swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the Invalides. If any grave-digger were delayed after that moment in the cemetery, there was but one way for him to get out‚Äîhis grave-digger‚Äôs card furnished by the department of public funerals. A sort of letter-box was constructed in the porter‚Äôs window. The grave-digger dropped his card into this box, the porter heard it fall, pulled the rope, and the small door opened. If the man had not his card, he mentioned his name, the porter, who was sometimes in bed and asleep, rose, came out and identified the man, and opened the gate with his key; the grave-digger stepped out, but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs.
U||This cemetery, with its peculiarities outside the regulations, embarrassed the symmetry of the administration. It was suppressed a little later than 1830. The cemetery of Mont-Parnasse, called the Eastern cemetery, succeeded to it, and inherited that famous dram-shop next to the Vaugirard cemetery, which was surmounted by a quince painted on a board, and which formed an angle, one side on the drinkers‚Äô tables, and the other on the tombs, with this sign: Au Bon Coing.
U||The Vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery. It was falling into disuse. Dampness was invading it, the flowers were deserting it. The bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the Vaugirard; it hinted at poverty. P√®re-Lachaise if you please! to be buried in P√®re-Lachaise is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany. It is recognized as elegant. The Vaugirard cemetery was a venerable enclosure, planted like an old-fashioned French garden. Straight alleys, box, thuya-trees, holly, ancient tombs beneath aged cypress-trees, and very tall grass. In the evening it was tragic there. There were very lugubrious lines about it.
U||The sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the black cross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery. The lame man who followed it was no other than Fauchelevent.
U||The interment of Mother Crucifixion in the vault under the altar, the exit of Cosette, the introduction of Jean Valjean to the dead-room,‚Äîall had been executed without difficulty, and there had been no hitch.
U||Let us remark in passing, that the burial of Mother Crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight. It is one of the faults which resemble a duty. The nuns had committed it, not only without difficulty, but even with the applause of their own consciences. In the cloister, what is called the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù is only an intermeddling with authority, an interference which is always questionable. In the first place, the rule; as for the code, we shall see. Make as many laws as you please, men; but keep them for yourselves. The tribute to C√¶sar is never anything but the remnants of the tribute to God. A prince is nothing in the presence of a principle.
U||Fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind. His twin plots, the one with the nuns, the one for the convent, the other against it, the other with M. Madeleine, had succeeded, to all appearance. Jean Valjean‚Äôs composure was one of those powerful tranquillities which are contagious. Fauchelevent no longer felt doubtful as to his success.
U||What remained to be done was a mere nothing. Within the last two years, he had made good Father Mestienne, a chubby-cheeked person, drunk at least ten times. He played with Father Mestienne. He did what he liked with him. He made him dance according to his whim. Mestienne‚Äôs head adjusted itself to the cap of Fauchelevent‚Äôs will. Fauchelevent‚Äôs confidence was perfect.
U||At the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery, Fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse, and said half aloud, as he rubbed his big hands:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a fine farce!‚Äù
U||All at once the hearse halted; it had reached the gate. The permission for interment must be exhibited. The undertaker‚Äôs man addressed himself to the porter of the cemetery. During this colloquy, which always is productive of a delay of from one to two minutes, some one, a stranger, came and placed himself behind the hearse, beside Fauchelevent. He was a sort of laboring man, who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm.
U||Fauchelevent surveyed this stranger.
U||‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù he demanded.
U||‚ÄúThe man replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe grave-digger.‚Äù
U||If a man could survive the blow of a cannon-ball full in the breast, he would make the same face that Fauchelevent made.
U||‚ÄúThe grave-digger?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFather Mestienne is the grave-digger.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe was.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat! He was?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe is dead.‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent had expected anything but this, that a grave-digger could die. It is true, nevertheless, that grave-diggers do die themselves. By dint of excavating graves for other people, one hollows out one‚Äôs own.
U||Fauchelevent stood there with his mouth wide open. He had hardly the strength to stammer:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBut it is not possible!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt is so.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut,‚Äù he persisted feebly, ‚ÄúFather Mestienne is the grave-digger.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAfter Napoleon, Louis XVIII. After Mestienne, Gribier. Peasant, my name is Gribier.‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent, who was deadly pale, stared at this Gribier.
U||He was a tall, thin, livid, utterly funereal man. He had the air of an unsuccessful doctor who had turned grave-digger.
U||Fauchelevent burst out laughing.
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù said he, ‚Äúwhat queer things do happen! Father Mestienne is dead, but long live little Father Lenoir! Do you know who little Father Lenoir is? He is a jug of red wine. It is a jug of Sur√™ne, morbigou! of real Paris Sur√™ne? Ah! So old Mestienne is dead! I am sorry for it; he was a jolly fellow. But you are a jolly fellow, too. Are you not, comrade? We‚Äôll go and have a drink together presently.‚Äù
U||The man replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI have been a student. I passed my fourth examination. I never drink.‚Äù
U||The hearse had set out again, and was rolling up the grand alley of the cemetery.
U||Fauchelevent had slackened his pace. He limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity.
U||The grave-digger walked on in front of him.
U||Fauchelevent passed the unexpected Gribier once more in review.
U||He was one of those men who, though very young, have the air of age, and who, though slender, are extremely strong.
U||‚ÄúComrade!‚Äù cried Fauchelevent.
U||The man turned round.
U||‚ÄúI am the convent grave-digger.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMy colleague,‚Äù said the man.
U||Fauchelevent, who was illiterate but very sharp, understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man, with a fine talker. He muttered:
U||‚ÄúSo Father Mestienne is dead.‚Äù
U||The man replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCompletely. The good God consulted his note-book which shows when the time is up. It was Father Mestienne‚Äôs turn. Father Mestienne died.‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent repeated mechanically: ‚ÄúThe good God‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe good God,‚Äù said the man authoritatively. ‚ÄúAccording to the philosophers, the Eternal Father; according to the Jacobins, the Supreme Being.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShall we not make each other‚Äôs acquaintance?‚Äù stammered Fauchelevent.
U||‚ÄúIt is made. You are a peasant, I am a Parisian.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPeople do not know each other until they have drunk together. He who empties his glass empties his heart. You must come and have a drink with me. Such a thing cannot be refused.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBusiness first.‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent thought: ‚ÄúI am lost.‚Äù
U||They were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nuns‚Äô corner.
U||The grave-digger resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúPeasant, I have seven small children who must be fed. As they must eat, I cannot drink.‚Äù
U||And he added, with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúTheir hunger is the enemy of my thirst.‚Äù
U||The hearse skirted a clump of cypress-trees, quitted the grand alley, turned into a narrow one, entered the waste land, and plunged into a thicket. This indicated the immediate proximity of the place of sepulture. Fauchelevent slackened his pace, but he could not detain the hearse. Fortunately, the soil, which was light and wet with the winter rains, clogged the wheels and retarded its speed.
U||He approached the grave-digger.
U||‚ÄúThey have such a nice little Argenteuil wine,‚Äù murmured Fauchelevent.
U||‚ÄúVillager,‚Äù retorted the man, ‚ÄúI ought not be a grave-digger. My father was a porter at the Prytaneum [Town-Hall]. He destined me for literature. But he had reverses. He had losses on ‚Äôchange. I was obliged to renounce the profession of author. But I am still a public writer.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSo you are not a grave-digger, then?‚Äù returned Fauchelevent, clutching at this branch, feeble as it was.
U||‚ÄúThe one does not hinder the other. I cumulate.‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent did not understand this last word.
U||‚ÄúCome have a drink,‚Äù said he.
U||Here a remark becomes necessary. Fauchelevent, whatever his anguish, offered a drink, but he did not explain himself on one point; who was to pay? Generally, Fauchelevent offered and Father Mestienne paid. An offer of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created by the new grave-digger, and it was necessary to make this offer, but the old gardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after Rabelais in the dark, and that not unintentionally. As for himself, Fauchelevent did not wish to pay, troubled as he was.
U||The grave-digger went on with a superior smile:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúOne must eat. I have accepted Father Mestienne‚Äôs reversion. One gets to be a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes. To the labor of the hand I join the labor of the arm. I have my scrivener‚Äôs stall in the market of the Rue de S√®vres. You know? the Umbrella Market. All the cooks of the Red Cross apply to me. I scribble their declarations of love to the raw soldiers. In the morning I write love letters; in the evening I dig graves. Such is life, rustic.‚Äù
U||The hearse was still advancing. Fauchelevent, uneasy to the last degree, was gazing about him on all sides. Great drops of perspiration trickled down from his brow.
U||‚ÄúBut,‚Äù continued the grave-digger, ‚Äúa man cannot serve two mistresses. I must choose between the pen and the mattock. The mattock is ruining my hand.‚Äù
U||The hearse halted.
U||The choir boy alighted from the mourning-coach, then the priest.
U||One of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a pile of earth, beyond which an open grave was visible.
U||‚ÄúWhat a farce this is!‚Äù repeated Fauchelevent in consternation.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîBETWEEN FOUR PLANKS
U||Who was in the coffin? The reader knows. Jean Valjean.
U||Jean Valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there, and he could almost breathe.
U||It is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience confers security of the rest. Every combination thought out by Jean Valjean had been progressing, and progressing favorably, since the preceding day. He, like Fauchelevent, counted on Father Mestienne. He had no doubt as to the end. Never was there a more critical situation, never more complete composure.
U||The four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace. It seemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into Jean Valjean‚Äôs tranquillity.
U||From the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow, and he had followed, all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing with death.
U||Shortly after Fauchelevent had finished nailing on the upper plank, Jean Valjean had felt himself carried out, then driven off. He knew, from the diminution in the jolting, when they left the pavements and reached the earth road. He had divined, from a dull noise, that they were crossing the bridge of Austerlitz. At the first halt, he had understood that they were entering the cemetery; at the second halt, he said to himself:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHere is the grave.‚Äù
U||Suddenly, he felt hands seize the coffin, then a harsh grating against the planks; he explained it to himself as the rope which was being fastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity.
U||Then he experienced a giddiness.
U||The undertaker‚Äôs man and the grave-digger had probably allowed the coffin to lose its balance, and had lowered the head before the foot. He recovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and motionless. He had just touched the bottom.
U||He had a certain sensation of cold.
U||A voice rose above him, glacial and solemn. He heard Latin words, which he did not understand, pass over him, so slowly that he was able to catch them one by one:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúQui dormiunt in terr√¶ pulvere, evigilabunt; alii in vitam √¶ternam, et alii in approbrium, ut videant semper.‚Äù
U||A child‚Äôs voice said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDe profundis.‚Äù
U||The grave voice began again:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúRequiem √¶ternam dona ei, Domine.‚Äù
U||The child‚Äôs voice responded:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúEt lux perpetua luceat ei.‚Äù
U||He heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain on the plank which covered him. It was probably the holy water.
U||He thought: ‚ÄúThis will be over soon now. Patience for a little while longer. The priest will take his departure. Fauchelevent will take Mestienne off to drink. I shall be left. Then Fauchelevent will return alone, and I shall get out. That will be the work of a good hour.‚Äù
U||The grave voice resumed
U||‚ÄúRequiescat in pace.‚Äù
U||And the child‚Äôs voice said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAmen.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean strained his ears, and heard something like retreating footsteps.
U||‚ÄúThere, they are going now,‚Äù thought he. ‚ÄúI am alone.‚Äù
U||All at once, he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him to be a clap of thunder.
U||It was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin.
U||A second shovelful fell.
U||One of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up.
U||A third shovelful of earth fell.
U||Then a fourth.
U||There are things which are too strong for the strongest man. Jean Valjean lost consciousness.
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîIN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE ORIGIN OF THE SAYING: DON‚ÄôT LOSE THE CARD
U||This is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay Jean Valjean.
U||When the hearse had driven off, when the priest and the choir boy had entered the carriage again and taken their departure, Fauchelevent, who had not taken his eyes from the grave-digger, saw the latter bend over and grasp his shovel, which was sticking upright in the heap of dirt.
U||Then Fauchelevent took a supreme resolve.
U||He placed himself between the grave and the grave-digger, crossed his arms and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am the one to pay!‚Äù
U||The grave-digger stared at him in amazement, and replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that, peasant?‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent repeated:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am the one who pays!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFor the wine.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat wine?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat Argenteuil wine.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhere is the Argenteuil?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAt the Bon Coing.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGo to the devil!‚Äù said the grave-digger.
U||And he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin.
U||The coffin gave back a hollow sound. Fauchelevent felt himself stagger and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself. He shouted in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to mingle:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúComrade! Before the Bon Coing is shut!‚Äù
U||The grave-digger took some more earth on his shovel. Fauchelevent continued.
U||‚ÄúI will pay.‚Äù
U||And he seized the man‚Äôs arm.
U||‚ÄúListen to me, comrade. I am the convent grave-digger, I have come to help you. It is a business which can be performed at night. Let us begin, then, by going for a drink.‚Äù
U||And as he spoke, and clung to this desperate insistence, this melancholy reflection occurred to him: ‚ÄúAnd if he drinks, will he get drunk?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúProvincial,‚Äù said the man, ‚Äúif you positively insist upon it, I consent. We will drink. After work, never before.‚Äù
U||And he flourished his shovel briskly. Fauchelevent held him back.
U||‚ÄúIt is Argenteuil wine, at six.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOh, come,‚Äù said the grave-digger, ‚Äúyou are a bell-ringer. Ding dong, ding dong, that‚Äôs all you know how to say. Go hang yourself.‚Äù
U||And he threw in a second shovelful.
U||Fauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he was saying.
U||‚ÄúCome along and drink,‚Äù he cried, ‚Äúsince it is I who pays the bill.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhen we have put the child to bed,‚Äù said the grave-digger.
U||He flung in a third shovelful.
U||Then he thrust his shovel into the earth and added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold to-night, you see, and the corpse would shriek out after us if we were to plant her there without a coverlet.‚Äù
U||At that moment, as he loaded his shovel, the grave-digger bent over, and the pocket of his waistcoat gaped. Fauchelevent‚Äôs wild gaze fell mechanically into that pocket, and there it stopped.
U||The sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon; there was still light enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of that yawning pocket.
U||The sum total of lightning that the eye of a Picard peasant can contain, traversed Fauchelevent‚Äôs pupils. An idea had just occurred to him.
U||He thrust his hand into the pocket from behind, without the grave-digger, who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth, observing it, and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it.
U||The man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave.
U||Just as he turned round to get the fifth, Fauchelevent looked calmly at him and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBy the way, you new man, have you your card?‚Äù
U||The grave-digger paused.
U||‚ÄúWhat card?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe sun is on the point of setting.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good, it is going to put on its nightcap.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe gate of the cemetery will close immediately.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell, what then?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHave you your card?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh! my card?‚Äù said the grave-digger.
U||And he fumbled in his pocket.
U||Having searched one pocket, he proceeded to search the other. He passed on to his fobs, explored the first, returned to the second.
U||‚ÄúWhy, no,‚Äù said he, ‚ÄúI have not my card. I must have forgotten it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFifteen francs fine,‚Äù said Fauchelevent.
U||The grave-digger turned green. Green is the pallor of livid people.
U||‚ÄúAh! J√©sus-mon-Dieu-bancroche-√†-bas-la-lune!‚Äù17 he exclaimed. ‚ÄúFifteen francs fine!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThree pieces of a hundred sous,‚Äù said Fauchelevent.
U||The grave-digger dropped his shovel.
U||Fauchelevent‚Äôs turn had come.
U||‚ÄúAh, come now, conscript,‚Äù said Fauchelevent, ‚Äúnone of this despair. There is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave. Fifteen francs is fifteen francs, and besides, you may not be able to pay it. I am an old hand, you are a new one. I know all the ropes and the devices. I will give you some friendly advice. One thing is clear, the sun is on the point of setting, it is touching the dome now, the cemetery will be closed in five minutes more.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is true,‚Äù replied the man.
U||‚ÄúFive minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave, it is as hollow as the devil, this grave, and to reach the gate in season to pass it before it is shut.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is true.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn that case, a fine of fifteen francs.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFifteen francs.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut you have time. Where do you live?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA couple of steps from the barrier, a quarter of an hour from here. No. 87 Rue de Vaugirard.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your best speed.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is exactly so.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOnce outside the gate, you gallop home, you get your card, you return, the cemetery porter admits you. As you have your card, there will be nothing to pay. And you will bury your corpse. I‚Äôll watch it for you in the meantime, so that it shall not run away.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am indebted to you for my life, peasant.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDecamp!‚Äù said Fauchelevent.
U||The grave-digger, overwhelmed with gratitude, shook his hand and set off on a run.
U||When the man had disappeared in the thicket, Fauchelevent listened until he heard his footsteps die away in the distance, then he leaned over the grave, and said in a low tone:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFather Madeleine!‚Äù
U||There was no reply.
U||Fauchelevent was seized with a shudder. He tumbled rather than climbed into the grave, flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAre you there?‚Äù
U||Silence in the coffin.
U||Fauchelevent, hardly able to draw his breath for trembling, seized his cold chisel and his hammer, and pried up the coffin lid.
U||Jean Valjean‚Äôs face appeared in the twilight; it was pale and his eyes were closed.
U||Fauchelevent‚Äôs hair rose upright on his head, he sprang to his feet, then fell back against the side of the grave, ready to swoon on the coffin. He stared at Jean Valjean.
U||Jean Valjean lay there pallid and motionless.
U||Fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHe is dead!‚Äù
U||And, drawing himself up, and folding his arms with such violence that his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders, he cried:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd this is the way I save his life!‚Äù
U||Then the poor man fell to sobbing. He soliloquized the while, for it is an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural. Powerful emotion often talks aloud.
U||‚ÄúIt is Father Mestienne‚Äôs fault. Why did that fool die? What need was there for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was expecting it? It is he who has killed M. Madeleine. Father Madeleine! He is in the coffin. It is quite handy. All is over. Now, is there any sense in these things? Ah! my God! he is dead! Well! and his little girl, what am I to do with her? What will the fruit-seller say? The idea of its being possible for a man like that to die like this! When I think how he put himself under that cart! Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine! Pardine! He was suffocated, I said so. He wouldn‚Äôt believe me. Well! Here‚Äôs a pretty trick to play! He is dead, that good man, the very best man out of all the good God‚Äôs good folks! And his little girl! Ah! In the first place, I won‚Äôt go back there myself. I shall stay here. After having done such a thing as that! What‚Äôs the use of being two old men, if we are two old fools! But, in the first place, how did he manage to enter the convent
U||? That was the beginning of it all. One should not do such things. Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine! Madeleine! Monsieur Madeleine! Monsieur le Maire! He does not hear me. Now get out of this scrape if you can!‚Äù
U||And he tore his hair.
U||A grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance. It was the cemetery gate closing.
U||Fauchelevent bent over Jean Valjean, and all at once he bounded back and recoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit.
U||Jean Valjean‚Äôs eyes were open and gazing at him.
U||To see a corpse is alarming, to behold a resurrection is almost as much so. Fauchelevent became like stone, pale, haggard, overwhelmed by all these excesses of emotion, not knowing whether he had to do with a living man or a dead one, and staring at Jean Valjean, who was gazing at him.
U||The Resurrection
U||‚ÄúI fell asleep,‚Äù said Jean Valjean.
U||And he raised himself to a sitting posture.
U||Fauchelevent fell on his knees.
U||‚ÄúJust, good Virgin! How you frightened me!‚Äù
U||Then he sprang to his feet and cried:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThanks, Father Madeleine!‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean had merely fainted. The fresh air had revived him.
U||Joy is the ebb of terror. Fauchelevent found almost as much difficulty in recovering himself as Jean Valjean had.
U||‚ÄúSo you are not dead! Oh! How wise you are! I called you so much that you came back. When I saw your eyes shut, I said: ‚ÄòGood! there he is, stifled,‚Äô I should have gone raving mad, mad enough for a strait jacket. They would have put me in Bic√™tre. What do you suppose I should have done if you had been dead? And your little girl? There‚Äôs that fruit-seller,‚Äîshe would never have understood it! The child is thrust into your arms, and then‚Äîthe grandfather is dead! What a story! good saints of paradise, what a tale! Ah! you are alive, that‚Äôs the best of it!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am cold,‚Äù said Jean Valjean.
U||This remark recalled Fauchelevent thoroughly to reality, and there was pressing need of it. The souls of these two men were troubled even when they had recovered themselves, although they did not realize it, and there was about them something uncanny, which was the sinister bewilderment inspired by the place.
U||‚ÄúLet us get out of here quickly,‚Äù exclaimed Fauchelevent.
U||He fumbled in his pocket, and pulled out a gourd with which he had provided himself.
U||‚ÄúBut first, take a drop,‚Äù said he.
U||The flask finished what the fresh air had begun, Jean Valjean swallowed a mouthful of brandy, and regained full possession of his faculties.
U||He got out of the coffin, and helped Fauchelevent to nail on the lid again.
U||Three minutes later they were out of the grave.
U||Moreover, Fauchelevent was perfectly composed. He took his time. The cemetery was closed. The arrival of the grave-digger Gribier was not to be apprehended. That ‚Äúconscript‚Äù was at home busily engaged in looking for his card, and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings, since it was in Fauchelevent‚Äôs pocket. Without a card, he could not get back into the cemetery.
U||Fauchelevent took the shovel, and Jean Valjean the pick-axe, and together they buried the empty coffin.
U||When the grave was full, Fauchelevent said to Jean Valjean:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLet us go. I will keep the shovel; do you carry off the mattock.‚Äù
U||Night was falling.
U||Jean Valjean experienced some difficulty in moving and in walking. He had stiffened himself in that coffin, and had become a little like a corpse. The rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four planks. He had, in a manner, to thaw out, from the tomb.
U||‚ÄúYou are benumbed,‚Äù said Fauchelevent. ‚ÄúIt is a pity that I have a game leg, for otherwise we might step out briskly.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBah!‚Äù replied Jean Valjean, ‚Äúfour paces will put life into my legs once more.‚Äù
U||They set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed. On arriving before the closed gate and the porter‚Äôs pavilion Fauchelevent, who held the grave-digger‚Äôs card in his hand, dropped it into the box, the porter pulled the rope, the gate opened, and they went out.
U||‚ÄúHow well everything is going!‚Äù said Fauchelevent; ‚Äúwhat a capital idea that was of yours, Father Madeleine!‚Äù
U||They passed the Vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world. In the neighborhood of the cemetery, a shovel and pick are equal to two passports.
U||The Rue Vaugirard was deserted.
U||‚ÄúFather Madeleine,‚Äù said Fauchelevent as they went along, and raising his eyes to the houses, ‚ÄúYour eyes are better than mine. Show me No. 87.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHere it is,‚Äù said Jean Valjean.
U||‚ÄúThere is no one in the street,‚Äù said Fauchelevent. ‚ÄúGive me your mattock and wait a couple of minutes for me.‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent entered No. 87, ascended to the very top, guided by the instinct which always leads the poor man to the garret, and knocked in the dark, at the door of an attic.
U||A voice replied: ‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù
U||It was Gribier‚Äôs voice.
U||Fauchelevent opened the door. The grave-digger‚Äôs dwelling was, like all such wretched habitations, an unfurnished and encumbered garret. A packing-case‚Äîa coffin, perhaps‚Äîtook the place of a commode, a butter-pot served for a drinking-fountain, a straw mattress served for a bed, the floor served instead of tables and chairs. In a corner, on a tattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet, a thin woman and a number of children were piled in a heap. The whole of this poverty-stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned. One would have said that there had been an earthquake ‚Äúfor one.‚Äù The covers were displaced, the rags scattered about, the jug broken, the mother had been crying, the children had probably been beaten; traces of a vigorous and ill-tempered search. It was plain that the grave-digger had made a desperate search for his card, and had made everybody in the garret, from the jug to his wife, responsible for its loss. He wore an air of desperation.
U||But Fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure to take any notice of this sad side of his success.
U||He entered and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI have brought you back your shovel and pick.‚Äù
U||Gribier gazed at him in stupefaction.
U||‚ÄúIs it you, peasant?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd to-morrow morning you will find your card with the porter of the cemetery.‚Äù
U||And he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor.
U||‚ÄúWhat is the meaning of this?‚Äù demanded Gribier.
U||‚ÄúThe meaning of it is, that you dropped your card out of your pocket, that I found it on the ground after you were gone, that I have buried the corpse, that I have filled the grave, that I have done your work, that the porter will return your card to you, and that you will not have to pay fifteen francs. There you have it, conscript.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThanks, villager!‚Äù exclaimed Gribier, radiant. ‚ÄúThe next time I will pay for the drinks.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîA SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATORY
U||An hour later, in the darkness of night, two men and a child presented themselves at No. 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. The elder of the men lifted the knocker and rapped.
U||They were Fauchelevent, Jean Valjean, and Cosette.
U||The two old men had gone to fetch Cosette from the fruiterer‚Äôs in the Rue du Chemin-Vert, where Fauchelevent had deposited her on the preceding day. Cosette had passed these twenty-four hours trembling silently and understanding nothing. She trembled to such a degree that she wept. She had neither eaten nor slept. The worthy fruit-seller had plied her with a hundred questions, without obtaining any other reply than a melancholy and unvarying gaze. Cosette had betrayed nothing of what she had seen and heard during the last two days. She divined that they were passing through a crisis. She was deeply conscious that it was necessary to ‚Äúbe good.‚Äù Who has not experienced the sovereign power of those two words, pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a terrified little being: Say nothing! Fear is mute. Moreover, no one guards a secret like a child.
U||But when, at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty-four hours, she beheld Jean Valjean again, she gave vent to such a cry of joy, that any thoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry, would have guessed that it issued from an abyss.
U||Fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the pass-words. All the doors opened.
U||Thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and how to get in.
U||The porter, who had received his instructions, opened the little servant‚Äôs door which connected the courtyard with the garden, and which could still be seen from the street twenty years ago, in the wall at the bottom of the court, which faced the carriage entrance.
U||The porter admitted all three of them through this door, and from that point they reached the inner, reserved parlor where Fauchelevent, on the preceding day, had received his orders from the prioress.
U||The prioress, rosary in hand, was waiting for them. A vocal mother, with her veil lowered, stood beside her.
U||A discreet candle lighted, one might almost say, made a show of lighting the parlor.
U||The prioress passed Jean Valjean in review. There is nothing which examines like a downcast eye.
U||Then she questioned him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou are the brother?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, reverend Mother,‚Äù replied Fauchelevent.
U||‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúUltime Fauchelevent.‚Äù
U||He really had had a brother named Ultime, who was dead.
U||‚ÄúWhere do you come from?‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFrom Picquigny, near Amiens.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is your age?‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFifty.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is your profession?‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGardener.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAre you a good Christian?‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúEvery one is in the family.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIs this your little girl?‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYes, reverend Mother.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are her father?‚Äù
U||Fauchelevent replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHer grandfather.‚Äù
U||The vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice
U||‚ÄúHe answers well.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean had not uttered a single word.
U||The prioress looked attentively at Cosette, and said half aloud to the vocal mother:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúShe will grow up ugly.‚Äù
U||The two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the corner of the parlor, then the prioress turned round and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFather Fauvent, you will get another knee-cap with a bell. Two will be required now.‚Äù
U||On the following day, therefore, two bells were audible in the garden, and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of their veils. At the extreme end of the garden, under the trees, two men, Fauvent and another man, were visible as they dug side by side. An enormous event. Their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each other: ‚ÄúHe is an assistant gardener.‚Äù
U||The vocal mothers added: ‚ÄúHe is a brother of Father Fauvent.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean was, in fact, regularly installed; he had his belled knee-cap; henceforth he was official. His name was Ultime Fauchelevent.
U||The most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the prioress‚Äôs observation upon Cosette: ‚ÄúShe will grow up ugly.‚Äù
U||The prioress, that pronounced prognosticator, immediately took a fancy to Cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil.
U||There is nothing that is not strictly logical about this.
U||It is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent, women are conscious of their faces; now, girls who are conscious of their beauty do not easily become nuns; the vocation being voluntary in inverse proportion to their good looks, more is to be hoped from the ugly than from the pretty. Hence a lively taste for plain girls.
U||The whole of this adventure increased the importance of good, old Fauchelevent; he won a triple success; in the eyes of Jean Valjean, whom he had saved and sheltered; in those of grave-digger Gribier, who said to himself: ‚ÄúHe spared me that fine‚Äù; with the convent, which, being enabled, thanks to him, to retain the coffin of Mother Crucifixion under the altar, eluded C√¶sar and satisfied God. There was a coffin containing a body in the Petit-Picpus, and a coffin without a body in the Vaugirard cemetery, public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed thereby, but no one was aware of it.
U||As for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was very great. Fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of gardeners. Upon the occasion of the archbishop‚Äôs next visit, the prioress recounted the affair to his Grace, making something of a confession at the same time, and yet boasting of her deed. On leaving the convent, the archbishop mentioned it with approval, and in a whisper to M. de Latil, Monsieur‚Äôs confessor, afterwards Archbishop of Reims and Cardinal. This admiration for Fauchelevent became widespread, for it made its way to Rome. We have seen a note addressed by the then reigning Pope, Leo XII., to one of his relatives, a Monsignor in the Nuncio‚Äôs establishment in Paris, and bearing, like himself, the name of Della Genga; it contained these lines: ‚ÄúIt appears that there is in a convent in Paris an excellent gardener, who is also a holy man, named Fauvent.‚Äù Nothing of this triumph reached Fauchelevent in his hut; he went on grafting, weeding, and covering up his me
U||lon beds, without in the least suspecting his excellences and his sanctity. Neither did he suspect his glory, any more than a Durham or Surrey bull whose portrait is published in the London Illustrated News, with this inscription: ‚ÄúBull which carried off the prize at the Cattle Show.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER IX‚ÄîCLOISTERED
U||Cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent.
U||It was quite natural that Cosette should think herself Jean Valjean‚Äôs daughter. Moreover, as she knew nothing, she could say nothing, and then, she would not have said anything in any case. As we have just observed, nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness. Cosette had suffered so much, that she feared everything, even to speak or to breathe. A single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her. She had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been with Jean Valjean. She speedily became accustomed to the convent. Only she regretted Catherine, but she dared not say so. Once, however, she did say to Jean Valjean: ‚ÄúFather, if I had known, I would have brought her away with me.‚Äù
U||Cosette had been obliged, on becoming a scholar in the convent, to don the garb of the pupils of the house. Jean Valjean succeeded in getting them to restore to him the garments which she laid aside. This was the same mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quitted the Th√©nardiers‚Äô inn. It was not very threadbare even now. Jean Valjean locked up these garments, plus the stockings and the shoes, with a quantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound, in a little valise which he found means of procuring. He set this valise on a chair near his bed, and he always carried the key about his person. ‚ÄúFather,‚Äù Cosette asked him one day, ‚Äúwhat is there in that box which smells so good?‚Äù
U||Father Fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action, in addition to the glory which we just mentioned, and of which he knew nothing; in the first place it made him happy; next, he had much less work, since it was shared. Lastly, as he was very fond of snuff, he found the presence of M. Madeleine an advantage, in that he used three times as much as he had done previously, and that in an infinitely more luxurious manner, seeing that M. Madeleine paid for it.
U||The nuns did not adopt the name of Ultime; they called Jean Valjean the other Fauvent.
U||If these holy women had possessed anything of Javert‚Äôs glance, they would eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be done outside in the behalf of the garden, it was always the elder Fauchelevent, the old, the infirm, the lame man, who went, and never the other; but whether it is that eyes constantly fixed on God know not how to spy, or whether they were, by preference, occupied in keeping watch on each other, they paid no heed to this.
U||Moreover, it was well for Jean Valjean that he kept close and did not stir out. Javert watched the quarter for more than a month.
U||This convent was for Jean Valjean like an island surrounded by gulfs. Henceforth, those four walls constituted his world. He saw enough of the sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity, and Cosette enough to remain happy.
U||A very sweet life began for him.
U||He inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden, in company with Fauchelevent. This hovel, built of old rubbish, which was still in existence in 1845, was composed, as the reader already knows, of three chambers, all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the walls. The principal one had been given up, by force, for Jean Valjean had opposed it in vain, to M. Madeleine, by Father Fauchelevent. The walls of this chamber had for ornament, in addition to the two nails whereon to hang the knee-cap and the basket, a Royalist bank-note of ‚Äô93, applied to the wall over the chimney-piece, and of which the following is an exact facsimile:‚Äî
U||Royalist Bank-note
U||This specimen of Vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall by the preceding gardener, an old Chouan, who had died in the convent, and whose place Fauchelevent had taken.
U||Jean Valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself very useful. He had formerly been a pruner of trees, and he gladly found himself a gardener once more. It will be remembered that he knew all sorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture. He turned these to advantage. Almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted, and wild. He budded them and made them produce excellent fruit.
U||Cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day. As the sisters were melancholy and he was kind, the child made comparisons and adored him. At the appointed hour she flew to the hut. When she entered the lowly cabin, she filled it with paradise. Jean Valjean blossomed out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded Cosette. The joy which we inspire has this charming property, that, far from growing meagre, like all reflections, it returns to us more radiant than ever. At recreation hours, Jean Valjean watched her running and playing in the distance, and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest.
U||For Cosette laughed now.
U||Cosette‚Äôs face had even undergone a change, to a certain extent. The gloom had disappeared from it. A smile is the same as sunshine; it banishes winter from the human countenance.
U||Recreation over, when Cosette went into the house again, Jean Valjean gazed at the windows of her class-room, and at night he rose to look at the windows of her dormitory.
U||God has his own ways, moreover; the convent contributed, like Cosette, to uphold and complete the Bishop‚Äôs work in Jean Valjean. It is certain that virtue adjoins pride on one side. A bridge built by the devil exists there. Jean Valjean had been, unconsciously, perhaps, tolerably near that side and that bridge, when Providence cast his lot in the convent of the Petit-Picpus; so long as he had compared himself only to the Bishop, he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble; but for some time past he had been comparing himself to men in general, and pride was beginning to spring up. Who knows? He might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred.
U||The convent stopped him on that downward path.
U||This was the second place of captivity which he had seen. In his youth, in what had been for him the beginning of his life, and later on, quite recently again, he had beheld another,‚Äîa frightful place, a terrible place, whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity of justice, and the crime of the law. Now, after the galleys, he saw the cloister; and when he meditated how he had formed a part of the galleys, and that he now, so to speak, was a spectator of the cloister, he confronted the two in his own mind with anxiety.
U||Sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe, and slowly descended the endless spirals of reverie.
U||He recalled his former companions: how wretched they were; they rose at dawn, and toiled until night; hardly were they permitted to sleep; they lay on camp beds, where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches thick, in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of the year; they were clothed in frightful red blouses; they were allowed, as a great favor, linen trousers in the hottest weather, and a woollen carter‚Äôs blouse on their backs when it was very cold; they drank no wine, and ate no meat, except when they went on ‚Äúfatigue duty.‚Äù They lived nameless, designated only by numbers, and converted, after a manner, into ciphers themselves, with downcast eyes, with lowered voices, with shorn heads, beneath the cudgel and in disgrace.
U||Then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes.
U||These beings also lived with shorn heads, with downcast eyes, with lowered voices, not in disgrace, but amid the scoffs of the world, not with their backs bruised with the cudgel, but with their shoulders lacerated with their discipline. Their names, also, had vanished from among men; they no longer existed except under austere appellations. They never ate meat and they never drank wine; they often remained until evening without food; they were attired, not in a red blouse, but in a black shroud, of woollen, which was heavy in summer and thin in winter, without the power to add or subtract anything from it; without having even, according to the season, the resource of the linen garment or the woollen cloak; and for six months in the year they wore serge chemises which gave them fever. They dwelt, not in rooms warmed only during rigorous cold, but in cells where no fire was ever lighted; they slept, not on mattresses two inches thick, but on straw. And finally, they were not even allowed their sleep; every ni
U||ght, after a day of toil, they were obliged, in the weariness of their first slumber, at the moment when they were falling sound asleep and beginning to get warm, to rouse themselves, to rise and to go and pray in an ice-cold and gloomy chapel, with their knees on the stones.
U||On certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelve successive hours in a kneeling posture, or prostrate, with face upon the pavement, and arms outstretched in the form of a cross.
U||The others were men; these were women.
U||What had those men done? They had stolen, violated, pillaged, murdered, assassinated. They were bandits, counterfeiters, poisoners, incendiaries, murderers, parricides. What had these women done? They had done nothing whatever.
U||On the one hand, highway robbery, fraud, deceit, violence, sensuality, homicide, all sorts of sacrilege, every variety of crime; on the other, one thing only, innocence.
U||Perfect innocence, almost caught up into heaven in a mysterious assumption, attached to the earth by virtue, already possessing something of heaven through holiness.
U||On the one hand, confidences over crimes, which are exchanged in whispers; on the other, the confession of faults made aloud. And what crimes! And what faults!
U||On the one hand, miasms; on the other, an ineffable perfume. On the one hand, a moral pest, guarded from sight, penned up under the range of cannon, and literally devouring its plague-stricken victims; on the other, the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth. There, darkness; here, the shadow; but a shadow filled with gleams of light, and of gleams full of radiance.
U||Two strongholds of slavery; but in the first, deliverance possible, a legal limit always in sight, and then, escape. In the second, perpetuity; the sole hope, at the distant extremity of the future, that faint light of liberty which men call death.
U||In the first, men are bound only with chains; in the other, chained by faith.
U||What flowed from the first? An immense curse, the gnashing of teeth, hatred, desperate viciousness, a cry of rage against human society, a sarcasm against heaven.
U||What results flowed from the second? Blessings and love.
U||And in these two places, so similar yet so unlike, these two species of beings who were so very unlike, were undergoing the same work, expiation.
U||Jean Valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former; that personal expiation, the expiation for one‚Äôs self. But he did not understand that of these last, that of creatures without reproach and without stain, and he trembled as he asked himself: The expiation of what? What expiation?
U||A voice within his conscience replied: ‚ÄúThe most divine of human generosities, the expiation for others.‚Äù
U||Here all personal theory is withheld; we are only the narrator; we place ourselves at Jean Valjean‚Äôs point of view, and we translate his impressions.
U||Before his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation, the highest possible pitch of virtue; the innocence which pardons men their faults, and which expiates in their stead; servitude submitted to, torture accepted, punishment claimed by souls which have not sinned, for the sake of sparing it to souls which have fallen; the love of humanity swallowed up in the love of God, but even there preserving its distinct and mediatorial character; sweet and feeble beings possessing the misery of those who are punished and the smile of those who are recompensed.
U||And he remembered that he had dared to murmur!
U||Often, in the middle of the night, he rose to listen to the grateful song of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities, and the blood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justly chastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy, and that he, wretch that he was, had shaken his fist at God.
U||There was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply, like a warning whisper from Providence itself: the scaling of that wall, the passing of those barriers, the adventure accepted even at the risk of death, the painful and difficult ascent, all those efforts even, which he had made to escape from that other place of expiation, he had made in order to gain entrance into this one. Was this a symbol of his destiny? This house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy resemblance to that other one whence he had fled, and yet he had never conceived an idea of anything similar.
U||Again he beheld gratings, bolts, iron bars‚Äîto guard whom? Angels.
U||These lofty walls which he had seen around tigers, he now beheld once more around lambs.
U||This was a place of expiation, and not of punishment; and yet, it was still more austere, more gloomy, and more pitiless than the other.
U||These virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts. A cold, harsh wind, that wind which had chilled his youth, traversed the barred and padlocked grating of the vultures; a still harsher and more biting breeze blew in the cage of these doves.
U||Why?
U||When he thought on these things, all that was within him was lost in amazement before this mystery of sublimity.
U||In these meditations, his pride vanished. He scrutinized his own heart in all manner of ways; he felt his pettiness, and many a time he wept. All that had entered into his life for the last six months had led him back towards the Bishop‚Äôs holy injunctions; Cosette through love, the convent through humility.
U||Sometimes at eventide, in the twilight, at an hour when the garden was deserted, he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk which skirted the chapel, in front of the window through which he had gazed on the night of his arrival, and turned towards the spot where, as he knew, the sister was making reparation, prostrated in prayer. Thus he prayed as he knelt before the sister.
U||It seemed as though he dared not kneel directly before God.
U||Everything that surrounded him, that peaceful garden, those fragrant flowers, those children who uttered joyous cries, those grave and simple women, that silent cloister, slowly permeated him, and little by little, his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister, of perfume like the flowers, of simplicity like the women, of joy like the children. And then he reflected that these had been two houses of God which had received him in succession at two critical moments in his life: the first, when all doors were closed and when human society rejected him; the second, at a moment when human society had again set out in pursuit of him, and when the galleys were again yawning; and that, had it not been for the first, he should have relapsed into crime, and had it not been for the second, into torment.
U||His whole heart melted in gratitude, and he loved more and more.
U||Many years passed in this manner; Cosette was growing up.

U||BOOK FIRST‚ÄîPARIS STUDIED IN ITS ATOM
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîPARVULUS
U||Paris has a child, and the forest has a bird; the bird is called the sparrow; the child is called the gamin.
U||Couple these two ideas which contain, the one all the furnace, the other all the dawn; strike these two sparks together, Paris, childhood; there leaps out from them a little being. Homuncio, Plautus would say.
U||This little being is joyous. He has not food every day, and he goes to the play every evening, if he sees good. He has no shirt on his body, no shoes on his feet, no roof over his head; he is like the flies of heaven, who have none of these things. He is from seven to thirteen years of age, he lives in bands, roams the streets, lodges in the open air, wears an old pair of trousers of his father‚Äôs, which descend below his heels, an old hat of some other father, which descends below his ears, a single suspender of yellow listing; he runs, lies in wait, rummages about, wastes time, blackens pipes, swears like a convict, haunts the wine-shop, knows thieves, calls gay women thou, talks slang, sings obscene songs, and has no evil in his heart. This is because he has in his heart a pearl, innocence; and pearls are not to be dissolved in mud. So long as man is in his childhood, God wills that he shall be innocent.
U||If one were to ask that enormous city: ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù she would reply: ‚ÄúIt is my little one.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîSOME OF HIS PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS
U||The gamin‚Äîthe street Arab‚Äîof Paris is the dwarf of the giant.
U||Let us not exaggerate, this cherub of the gutter sometimes has a shirt, but, in that case, he owns but one; he sometimes has shoes, but then they have no soles; he sometimes has a lodging, and he loves it, for he finds his mother there; but he prefers the street, because there he finds liberty. He has his own games, his own bits of mischief, whose foundation consists of hatred for the bourgeois; his peculiar metaphors: to be dead is to eat dandelions by the root; his own occupations, calling hackney-coaches, letting down carriage-steps, establishing means of transit between the two sides of a street in heavy rains, which he calls making the bridge of arts, crying discourses pronounced by the authorities in favor of the French people, cleaning out the cracks in the pavement; he has his own coinage, which is composed of all the little morsels of worked copper which are found on the public streets. This curious money, which receives the name of loques‚Äîrags‚Äîhas an invariable and well-regulated currency in th
U||is little Bohemia of children.
U||Lastly, he has his own fauna, which he observes attentively in the corners; the lady-bird, the death‚Äôs-head plant-louse, the daddy-long-legs, ‚Äúthe devil,‚Äù a black insect, which menaces by twisting about its tail armed with two horns. He has his fabulous monster, which has scales under its belly, but is not a lizard, which has pustules on its back, but is not a toad, which inhabits the nooks of old lime-kilns and wells that have run dry, which is black, hairy, sticky, which crawls sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly, which has no cry, but which has a look, and is so terrible that no one has ever beheld it; he calls this monster ‚Äúthe deaf thing.‚Äù The search for these ‚Äúdeaf things‚Äù among the stones is a joy of formidable nature. Another pleasure consists in suddenly prying up a paving-stone, and taking a look at the wood-lice. Each region of Paris is celebrated for the interesting treasures which are to be found there. There are ear-wigs in the timber-yards of the Ursulines, there are millepeds in
U|| the Pantheon, there are tadpoles in the ditches of the Champs-de-Mars.
U||As far as sayings are concerned, this child has as many of them as Talleyrand. He is no less cynical, but he is more honest. He is endowed with a certain indescribable, unexpected joviality; he upsets the composure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter. He ranges boldly from high comedy to farce.
U||A funeral passes by. Among those who accompany the dead there is a doctor. ‚ÄúHey there!‚Äù shouts some street Arab, ‚Äúhow long has it been customary for doctors to carry home their own work?‚Äù
U||Another is in a crowd. A grave man, adorned with spectacles and trinkets, turns round indignantly: ‚ÄúYou good-for-nothing, you have seized my wife‚Äôs waist!‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúI, sir? Search me!‚Äù
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîHE IS AGREEABLE
U||In the evening, thanks to a few sous, which he always finds means to procure, the homuncio enters a theatre. On crossing that magic threshold, he becomes transfigured; he was the street Arab, he becomes the titi.18 Theatres are a sort of ship turned upside down with the keel in the air. It is in that keel that the titi huddle together. The titi is to the gamin what the moth is to the larva; the same being endowed with wings and soaring. It suffices for him to be there, with his radiance of happiness, with his power of enthusiasm and joy, with his hand-clapping, which resembles a clapping of wings, to confer on that narrow, dark, fetid, sordid, unhealthy, hideous, abominable keel, the name of Paradise.
U||Bestow on an individual the useless and deprive him of the necessary, and you have the gamin.
U||The gamin is not devoid of literary intuition. His tendency, and we say it with the proper amount of regret, would not constitute classic taste. He is not very academic by nature. Thus, to give an example, the popularity of Mademoiselle Mars among that little audience of stormy children was seasoned with a touch of irony. The gamin called her Mademoiselle Muche‚Äî‚Äúhide yourself.‚Äù
U||This being bawls and scoffs and ridicules and fights, has rags like a baby and tatters like a philosopher, fishes in the sewer, hunts in the cesspool, extracts mirth from foulness, whips up the squares with his wit, grins and bites, whistles and sings, shouts, and shrieks, tempers Alleluia with Matanturlurette, chants every rhythm from the De Profundis to the Jack-pudding, finds without seeking, knows what he is ignorant of, is a Spartan to the point of thieving, is mad to wisdom, is lyrical to filth, would crouch down on Olympus, wallows in the dunghill and emerges from it covered with stars. The gamin of Paris is Rabelais in this youth.
U||He is not content with his trousers unless they have a watch-pocket.
U||He is not easily astonished, he is still less easily terrified, he makes songs on superstitions, he takes the wind out of exaggerations, he twits mysteries, he thrusts out his tongue at ghosts, he takes the poetry out of stilted things, he introduces caricature into epic extravaganzas. It is not that he is prosaic; far from that; but he replaces the solemn vision by the farcical phantasmagoria. If Adamastor were to appear to him, the street Arab would say: ‚ÄúHi there! The bugaboo!‚Äù
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîHE MAY BE OF USE
U||Paris begins with the lounger and ends with the street Arab, two beings of which no other city is capable; the passive acceptance, which contents itself with gazing, and the inexhaustible initiative; Prudhomme and Fouillou. Paris alone has this in its natural history. The whole of the monarchy is contained in the lounger; the whole of anarchy in the gamin.
U||This pale child of the Parisian faubourgs lives and develops, makes connections, ‚Äúgrows supple‚Äù in suffering, in the presence of social realities and of human things, a thoughtful witness. He thinks himself heedless; and he is not. He looks and is on the verge of laughter; he is on the verge of something else also. Whoever you may be, if your name is Prejudice, Abuse, Ignorance, Oppression, Iniquity, Despotism, Injustice, Fanaticism, Tyranny, beware of the gaping gamin.
U||The little fellow will grow up.
U||Of what clay is he made? Of the first mud that comes to hand. A handful of dirt, a breath, and behold Adam. It suffices for a God to pass by. A God has always passed over the street Arab. Fortune labors at this tiny being. By the word ‚Äúfortune‚Äù we mean chance, to some extent. That pigmy kneaded out of common earth, ignorant, unlettered, giddy, vulgar, low. Will that become an Ionian or a B≈ìotian? Wait, currit rota, the Spirit of Paris, that demon which creates the children of chance and the men of destiny, reversing the process of the Latin potter, makes of a jug an amphora.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîHIS FRONTIERS
U||The gamin loves the city, he also loves solitude, since he has something of the sage in him. Urbis amator, like Fuscus; ruris amator, like Flaccus.
U||To roam thoughtfully about, that is to say, to lounge, is a fine employment of time in the eyes of the philosopher; particularly in that rather illegitimate species of campaign, which is tolerably ugly but odd and composed of two natures, which surrounds certain great cities, notably Paris. To study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal. End of the trees, beginning of the roofs; end of the grass, beginning of the pavements; end of the furrows, beginning of the shops, end of the wheel-ruts, beginning of the passions; end of the divine murmur, beginning of the human uproar; hence an extraordinary interest.
U||Hence, in these not very attractive places, indelibly stamped by the passing stroller with the epithet: melancholy, the apparently objectless promenades of the dreamer.
U||He who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriers of Paris, and it is for him a source of profound souvenirs. That close-shaven turf, those pebbly paths, that chalk, those pools, those harsh monotonies of waste and fallow lands, the plants of early market-garden suddenly springing into sight in a bottom, that mixture of the savage and the citizen, those vast desert nooks where the garrison drums practise noisily, and produce a sort of lisping of battle, those hermits by day and cut-throats by night, that clumsy mill which turns in the wind, the hoisting-wheels of the quarries, the tea-gardens at the corners of the cemeteries; the mysterious charm of great, sombre walls squarely intersecting immense, vague stretches of land inundated with sunshine and full of butterflies,‚Äîall this attracted him.
U||There is hardly any one on earth who is not acquainted with those singular spots, the Glaci√®re, the Cunette, the hideous wall of Grenelle all speckled with balls, Mont-Parnasse, the Fosse-aux-Loups, Aubiers on the bank of the Marne, Mont-Souris, the Tombe-Issoire, the Pierre-Plate de Ch√¢tillon, where there is an old, exhausted quarry which no longer serves any purpose except to raise mushrooms, and which is closed, on a level with the ground, by a trap-door of rotten planks. The campagna of Rome is one idea, the banlieue of Paris is another; to behold nothing but fields, houses, or trees in what a stretch of country offers us, is to remain on the surface; all aspects of things are thoughts of God. The spot where a plain effects its junction with a city is always stamped with a certain piercing melancholy. Nature and humanity both appeal to you at the same time there. Local originalities there make their appearance.
U||Any one who, like ourselves, has wandered about in these solitudes contiguous to our faubourgs, which may be designated as the limbos of Paris, has seen here and there, in the most desert spot, at the most unexpected moment, behind a meagre hedge, or in the corner of a lugubrious wall, children grouped tumultuously, fetid, muddy, dusty, ragged, dishevelled, playing hide-and-seek, and crowned with corn-flowers. All of them are little ones who have made their escape from poor families. The outer boulevard is their breathing space; the suburbs belong to them. There they are eternally playing truant. There they innocently sing their repertory of dirty songs. There they are, or rather, there they exist, far from every eye, in the sweet light of May or June, kneeling round a hole in the ground, snapping marbles with their thumbs, quarrelling over half-farthings, irresponsible, volatile, free and happy; and, no sooner do they catch sight of you than they recollect that they have an industry, and that they must earn
U|| their living, and they offer to sell you an old woollen stocking filled with cockchafers, or a bunch of lilacs. These encounters with strange children are one of the charming and at the same time poignant graces of the environs of Paris.
U||Sometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys,‚Äîare they their sisters?‚Äîwho are almost young maidens, thin, feverish, with sunburnt hands, covered with freckles, crowned with poppies and ears of rye, gay, haggard, barefooted. They can be seen devouring cherries among the wheat. In the evening they can be heard laughing. These groups, warmly illuminated by the full glow of midday, or indistinctly seen in the twilight, occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time, and these visions mingle with his dreams.
U||Paris, centre, banlieue, circumference; this constitutes all the earth to those children. They never venture beyond this. They can no more escape from the Parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from the water. For them, nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers: Ivry, Gentilly, Arcueil, Belleville, Aubervilliers, M√©nilmontant, Choisy-le-Roi, Billancourt, Meudon, Issy, Vanvre, S√®vres, Puteaux, Neuilly, Gennevilliers, Colombes, Romainville, Chatou, Asni√®res, Bougival, Nanterre, Enghien, Noisy-le-Sec, Nogent, Gournay, Drancy, Gonesse; the universe ends there.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîA BIT OF HISTORY
U||At the epoch, nearly contemporary by the way, when the action of this book takes place, there was not, as there is to-day, a policeman at the corner of every street (a benefit which there is no time to discuss here); stray children abounded in Paris. The statistics give an average of two hundred and sixty homeless children picked up annually at that period, by the police patrols, in unenclosed lands, in houses in process of construction, and under the arches of the bridges. One of these nests, which has become famous, produced ‚Äúthe swallows of the bridge of Arcola.‚Äù This is, moreover, the most disastrous of social symptoms. All crimes of the man begin in the vagabondage of the child.
U||Let us make an exception in favor of Paris, nevertheless. In a relative measure, and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled, the exception is just. While in any other great city the vagabond child is a lost man, while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is, in some sort, sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the public vices which devour in him honesty and conscience, the street boy of Paris, we insist on this point, however defaced and injured on the surface, is almost intact on the interior. It is a magnificent thing to put on record, and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of our popular revolutions, that a certain incorruptibility results from the idea which exists in the air of Paris, as salt exists in the water of the ocean. To breathe Paris preserves the soul.
U||What we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart which one experiences every time that one meets one of these children around whom one fancies that he beholds floating the threads of a broken family. In the civilization of the present day, incomplete as it still is, it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured families pouring themselves out into the darkness, not knowing clearly what has become of their children, and allowing their own entrails to fall on the public highway. Hence these obscure destinies. This is called, for this sad thing has given rise to an expression, ‚Äúto be cast on the pavements of Paris.‚Äù
U||Let it be said by the way, that this abandonment of children was not discouraged by the ancient monarchy. A little of Egypt and Bohemia in the lower regions suited the upper spheres, and compassed the aims of the powerful. The hatred of instruction for the children of the people was a dogma. What is the use of ‚Äúhalf-lights‚Äù? Such was the countersign. Now, the erring child is the corollary of the ignorant child.
U||Besides this, the monarchy sometimes was in need of children, and in that case it skimmed the streets.
U||Under Louis XIV., not to go any further back, the king rightly desired to create a fleet. The idea was a good one. But let us consider the means. There can be no fleet, if, beside the sailing ship, that plaything of the winds, and for the purpose of towing it, in case of necessity, there is not the vessel which goes where it pleases, either by means of oars or of steam; the galleys were then to the marine what steamers are to-day. Therefore, galleys were necessary; but the galley is moved only by the galley-slave; hence, galley-slaves were required. Colbert had the commissioners of provinces and the parliaments make as many convicts as possible. The magistracy showed a great deal of complaisance in the matter. A man kept his hat on in the presence of a procession‚Äîit was a Huguenot attitude; he was sent to the galleys. A child was encountered in the streets; provided that he was fifteen years of age and did not know where he was to sleep, he was sent to the galleys. Grand reign; grand century.
U||Under Louis XV. children disappeared in Paris; the police carried them off, for what mysterious purpose no one knew. People whispered with terror monstrous conjectures as to the king‚Äôs baths of purple. Barbier speaks ingenuously of these things. It sometimes happened that the exempts of the guard, when they ran short of children, took those who had fathers. The fathers, in despair, attacked the exempts. In that case, the parliament intervened and had some one hung. Who? The exempts? No, the fathers.
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîTHE GAMIN SHOULD HAVE HIS PLACE IN THE CLASSIFICATIONS OF INDIA
U||The body of street Arabs in Paris almost constitutes a caste. One might almost say: Not every one who wishes to belong to it can do so.
U||This word gamin was printed for the first time, and reached popular speech through the literary tongue, in 1834. It is in a little work entitled Claude Gueux that this word made its appearance. The horror was lively. The word passed into circulation.
U||The elements which constitute the consideration of the gamins for each other are very various. We have known and associated with one who was greatly respected and vastly admired because he had seen a man fall from the top of the tower of Notre-Dame; another, because he had succeeded in making his way into the rear courtyard where the statues of the dome of the Invalides had been temporarily deposited, and had ‚Äúprigged‚Äù some lead from them; a third, because he had seen a diligence tip over; still another, because he ‚Äúknew‚Äù a soldier who came near putting out the eye of a citizen.
U||This explains that famous exclamation of a Parisian gamin, a profound epiphonema, which the vulgar herd laughs at without comprehending,‚Äî Dieu de Dieu! What ill-luck I do have! to think that I have never yet seen anybody tumble from a fifth-story window! (I have pronounced I‚Äôave and fifth pronounced fift‚Äô.)
U||Surely, this saying of a peasant is a fine one: ‚ÄúFather So-and-So, your wife has died of her malady; why did you not send for the doctor?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat would you have, sir, we poor folks die of ourselves.‚Äù But if the peasant‚Äôs whole passivity lies in this saying, the whole of the free-thinking anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is, assuredly, contained in this other saying. A man condemned to death is listening to his confessor in the tumbrel. The child of Paris exclaims: ‚ÄúHe is talking to his black cap! Oh, the sneak!‚Äù
U||A certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin. To be strong-minded is an important item.
U||To be present at executions constitutes a duty. He shows himself at the guillotine, and he laughs. He calls it by all sorts of pet names: The End of the Soup, The Growler, The Mother in the Blue (the sky), The Last Mouthful, etc., etc. In order not to lose anything of the affair, he scales the walls, he hoists himself to balconies, he ascends trees, he suspends himself to gratings, he clings fast to chimneys. The gamin is born a tiler as he is born a mariner. A roof inspires him with no more fear than a mast. There is no festival which comes up to an execution on the Place de Gr√®ve. Samson and the Abb√© Mont√®s are the truly popular names. They hoot at the victim in order to encourage him. They sometimes admire him. Lacenaire, when a gamin, on seeing the hideous Dautin die bravely, uttered these words which contain a future: ‚ÄúI was jealous of him.‚Äù In the brotherhood of gamins Voltaire is not known, but Papavoine is. ‚ÄúPoliticians‚Äù are confused with assassins in the same legend. They have a tradition
U|| as to everybody‚Äôs last garment. It is known that Tolleron had a fireman‚Äôs cap, Avril an otter cap, Losvel a round hat, that old Delaporte was bald and bareheaded, that Castaing was all ruddy and very handsome, that Bories had a romantic small beard, that Jean Martin kept on his suspenders, that Lecouff√© and his mother quarrelled. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt reproach each other for your basket,‚Äù shouted a gamin to them. Another, in order to get a look at Debacker as he passed, and being too small in the crowd, caught sight of the lantern on the quay and climbed it. A gendarme stationed opposite frowned. ‚ÄúLet me climb up, m‚Äôsieu le gendarme,‚Äù said the gamin. And, to soften the heart of the authorities he added: ‚ÄúI will not fall.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if you do,‚Äù retorted the gendarme.
U||In the brotherhood of gamins, a memorable accident counts for a great deal. One reaches the height of consideration if one chances to cut one‚Äôs self very deeply, ‚Äúto the very bone.‚Äù
U||The fist is no mediocre element of respect. One of the things that the gamin is fondest of saying is: ‚ÄúI am fine and strong, come now!‚Äù To be left-handed renders you very enviable. A squint is highly esteemed.
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîIN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND A CHARMING SAYING OF THE LAST KING
U||In summer, he metamorphoses himself into a frog; and in the evening, when night is falling, in front of the bridges of Austerlitz and Jena, from the tops of coal wagons, and the washerwomen‚Äôs boats, he hurls himself headlong into the Seine, and into all possible infractions of the laws of modesty and of the police. Nevertheless the police keep an eye on him, and the result is a highly dramatic situation which once gave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry; that cry which was celebrated about 1830, is a strategic warning from gamin to gamin; it scans like a verse from Homer, with a notation as inexpressible as the eleusiac chant of the Panathen√¶a, and in it one encounters again the ancient Evohe. Here it is: ‚ÄúOh√©, Titi, oh√©√©√©! Here comes the bobby, here comes the p‚Äôlice, pick up your duds and be off, through the sewer with you!‚Äù
U||Sometimes this gnat‚Äîthat is what he calls himself‚Äîknows how to read; sometimes he knows how to write; he always knows how to daub. He does not hesitate to acquire, by no one knows what mysterious mutual instruction, all the talents which can be of use to the public; from 1815 to 1830, he imitated the cry of the turkey; from 1830 to 1848, he scrawled pears on the walls. One summer evening, when Louis Philippe was returning home on foot, he saw a little fellow, no higher than his knee, perspiring and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal on one of the pillars of the gate of Neuilly; the King, with that good-nature which came to him from Henry IV., helped the gamin, finished the pear, and gave the child a louis, saying: ‚ÄúThe pear is on that also.‚Äù19 The gamin loves uproar. A certain state of violence pleases him. He execrates ‚Äúthe cur√©s.‚Äù One day, in the Rue de l‚ÄôUniversit√©, one of these scamps was putting his thumb to his nose at the carriage gate of No. 69. ‚ÄúWhy are you doing that 
U||at the gate?‚Äù a passer-by asked. The boy replied: ‚ÄúThere is a cur√© there.‚Äù It was there, in fact, that the Papal Nuncio lived.
U||Nevertheless, whatever may be the Voltairianism of the small gamin, if the occasion to become a chorister presents itself, it is quite possible that he will accept, and in that case he serves the mass civilly. There are two things to which he plays Tantalus, and which he always desires without ever attaining them: to overthrow the government, and to get his trousers sewed up again.
U||The gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of Paris, and can always put the name to the face of any one which he chances to meet. He can tell them off on the tips of his fingers. He studies their habits, and he has special notes on each one of them. He reads the souls of the police like an open book. He will tell you fluently and without flinching: ‚ÄúSuch an one is a traitor; such another is very malicious; such another is great; such another is ridiculous.‚Äù (All these words: traitor, malicious, great, ridiculous, have a particular meaning in his mouth.) That one imagines that he owns the Pont-Neuf, and he prevents people from walking on the cornice outside the parapet; that other has a mania for pulling person‚Äôs ears; etc., etc.
U||CHAPTER IX‚ÄîTHE OLD SOUL OF GAUL
U||There was something of that boy in Poquelin, the son of the fish-market; Beaumarchais had something of it. Gaminerie is a shade of the Gallic spirit. Mingled with good sense, it sometimes adds force to the latter, as alcohol does to wine. Sometimes it is a defect. Homer repeats himself eternally, granted; one may say that Voltaire plays the gamin. Camille Desmoulins was a native of the faubourgs. Championnet, who treated miracles brutally, rose from the pavements of Paris; he had, when a small lad, inundated the porticos of Saint-Jean de Beauvais, and of Saint-√âtienne du Mont; he had addressed the shrine of Sainte-Genevi√®ve familiarly to give orders to the phial of Saint Januarius.
U||The gamin of Paris is respectful, ironical, and insolent. He has villainous teeth, because he is badly fed and his stomach suffers, and handsome eyes because he has wit. If Jehovah himself were present, he would go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot. He is strong on boxing. All beliefs are possible to him. He plays in the gutter, and straightens himself up with a revolt; his effrontery persists even in the presence of grape-shot; he was a scapegrace, he is a hero; like the little Theban, he shakes the skin from the lion; Barra the drummer-boy was a gamin of Paris; he Shouts: ‚ÄúForward!‚Äù as the horse of Scripture says ‚ÄúVah!‚Äù and in a moment he has passed from the small brat to the giant.
U||This child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal. Measure that spread of wings which reaches from Moli√®re to Barra.
U||To sum up the whole, and in one word, the gamin is a being who amuses himself, because he is unhappy.
U||CHAPTER X‚ÄîECCE PARIS, ECCE HOMO
U||To sum it all up once more, the Paris gamin of to-day, like the gr√¶culus of Rome in days gone by, is the infant populace with the wrinkle of the old world on his brow.
U||The gamin is a grace to the nation, and at the same time a disease; a disease which must be cured, how? By light.
U||Light renders healthy.
U||Light kindles.
U||All generous social irradiations spring from science, letters, arts, education. Make men, make men. Give them light that they may warm you. Sooner or later the splendid question of universal education will present itself with the irresistible authority of the absolute truth; and then, those who govern under the superintendence of the French idea will have to make this choice; the children of France or the gamins of Paris; flames in the light or will-o‚Äô-the-wisps in the gloom.
U||The gamin expresses Paris, and Paris expresses the world.
U||For Paris is a total. Paris is the ceiling of the human race. The whole of this prodigious city is a foreshortening of dead manners and living manners. He who sees Paris thinks he sees the bottom of all history with heaven and constellations in the intervals. Paris has a capital, the Town-Hall, a Parthenon, Notre-Dame, a Mount Aventine, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, an Asinarium, the Sorbonne, a Pantheon, the Pantheon, a Via Sacra, the Boulevard des Italiens, a temple of the winds, opinion; and it replaces the Gemoni√¶ by ridicule. Its majo is called ‚Äúfaraud,‚Äù its Transteverin is the man of the faubourgs, its hammal is the market-porter, its lazzarone is the p√®gre, its cockney is the native of Ghent. Everything that exists elsewhere exists at Paris. The fishwoman of Dumarsais can retort on the herb-seller of Euripides, the discobols Vejanus lives again in the Forioso, the tight-rope dancer. Therapontigonus Miles could walk arm in arm with Vadebonc≈ìur the grenadier, Damasippus the second-hand dealer would
U|| be happy among bric-√†-brac merchants, Vincennes could grasp Socrates in its fist as just as Agora could imprison Diderot, Grimod de la Reyni√®re discovered larded roast beef, as Curtillus invented roast hedgehog, we see the trapeze which figures in Plautus reappear under the vault of the Arc of l‚ÄôEtoile, the sword-eater of P≈ìcilus encountered by Apuleius is a sword-swallower on the Pont-Neuf, the nephew of Rameau and Curculio the parasite make a pair, Ergasilus could get himself presented to Cambac√®res by d‚ÄôAigrefeuille; the four dandies of Rome: Alcesimarchus, Ph≈ìdromus, Diabolus, and Argyrippus, descend from Courtille in Labatut‚Äôs posting-chaise; Aulus Gellius would halt no longer in front of Congrio than would Charles Nodier in front of Punchinello; Marto is not a tigress, but Pardalisca was not a dragon; Pantolabus the wag jeers in the Caf√© Anglais at Nomentanus the fast liver, Hermogenus is a tenor in the Champs-√âlys√©es, and round him, Thracius the beggar, clad like Bob√®che, takes up a co
U||llection; the bore who stops you by the button of your coat in the Tuileries makes you repeat after a lapse of two thousand years Thesprion‚Äôs apostrophe: Quis properantem me prehendit pallio? The wine on Sur√™ne is a parody of the wine of Alba, the red border of Desaugiers forms a balance to the great cutting of Balatro, P√®re-Lachaise exhales beneath nocturnal rains the same gleams as the Esquili√¶, and the grave of the poor bought for five years, is certainly the equivalent of the slave‚Äôs hived coffin.
U||Seek something that Paris has not. The vat of Trophonius contains nothing that is not in Mesmer‚Äôs tub; Ergaphilas lives again in Cagliostro; the Brahmin V√¢saphant√¢ become incarnate in the Comte de Saint-Germain; the cemetery of Saint-M√©dard works quite as good miracles as the Mosque of Oumoumi√© at Damascus.
U||Paris has an √Üsop-Mayeux, and a Canidia, Mademoiselle Lenormand. It is terrified, like Delphos at the fulgurating realities of the vision; it makes tables turn as Dodona did tripods. It places the grisette on the throne, as Rome placed the courtesan there; and, taking it altogether, if Louis XV. is worse than Claudian, Madame Dubarry is better than Messalina. Paris combines in an unprecedented type, which has existed and which we have elbowed, Grecian nudity, the Hebraic ulcer, and the Gascon pun. It mingles Diogenes, Job, and Jack-pudding, dresses up a spectre in old numbers of the Constitutional, and makes Chodruc Duclos.
U||Although Plutarch says: the tyrant never grows old, Rome, under Sylla as under Domitian, resigned itself and willingly put water in its wine. The Tiber was a Lethe, if the rather doctrinary eulogium made of it by Varus Vibiscus is to be credited: Contra Gracchos Tiberim habemus, Bibere Tiberim, id est seditionem oblivisci. Paris drinks a million litres of water a day, but that does not prevent it from occasionally beating the general alarm and ringing the tocsin.
U||With that exception, Paris is amiable. It accepts everything royally; it is not too particular about its Venus; its Callipyge is Hottentot; provided that it is made to laugh, it condones; ugliness cheers it, deformity provokes it to laughter, vice diverts it; be eccentric and you may be an eccentric; even hypocrisy, that supreme cynicism, does not disgust it; it is so literary that it does not hold its nose before Basile, and is no more scandalized by the prayer of Tartuffe than Horace was repelled by the ‚Äúhiccup‚Äù of Priapus. No trait of the universal face is lacking in the profile of Paris. The bal Mabile is not the polymnia dance of the Janiculum, but the dealer in ladies‚Äô wearing apparel there devours the lorette with her eyes, exactly as the procuress Staphyla lay in wait for the virgin Planesium. The Barri√®re du Combat is not the Coliseum, but people are as ferocious there as though C√¶sar were looking on. The Syrian hostess has more grace than Mother Saguet, but, if Virgil haunted the Roman wine
U||-shop, David d‚ÄôAngers, Balzac and Charlet have sat at the tables of Parisian taverns. Paris reigns. Geniuses flash forth there, the red tails prosper there. Adona√Ø passes on his chariot with its twelve wheels of thunder and lightning; Silenus makes his entry there on his ass. For Silenus read Ramponneau.
U||Paris is the synonym of Cosmos, Paris is Athens, Sybaris, Jerusalem, Pantin. All civilizations are there in an abridged form, all barbarisms also. Paris would greatly regret it if it had not a guillotine.
U||A little of the Place de Gr√®ve is a good thing. What would all that eternal festival be without this seasoning? Our laws are wisely provided, and thanks to them, this blade drips on this Shrove Tuesday.
U||CHAPTER XI‚ÄîTO SCOFF, TO REIGN
U||There is no limit to Paris. No city has had that domination which sometimes derides those whom it subjugates. To please you, O Athenians! exclaimed Alexander. Paris makes more than the law, it makes the fashion; Paris sets more than the fashion, it sets the routine. Paris may be stupid, if it sees fit; it sometimes allows itself this luxury; then the universe is stupid in company with it; then Paris awakes, rubs its eyes, says: ‚ÄúHow stupid I am!‚Äù and bursts out laughing in the face of the human race. What a marvel is such a city! it is a strange thing that this grandioseness and this burlesque should be amicable neighbors, that all this majesty should not be thrown into disorder by all this parody, and that the same mouth can to-day blow into the trump of the Judgment Day, and to-morrow into the reed-flute! Paris has a sovereign joviality. Its gayety is of the thunder and its farce holds a sceptre.
U||Its tempest sometimes proceeds from a grimace. Its explosions, its days, its masterpieces, its prodigies, its epics, go forth to the bounds of the universe, and so also do its cock-and-bull stories. Its laugh is the mouth of a volcano which spatters the whole earth. Its jests are sparks. It imposes its caricatures as well as its ideal on people; the highest monuments of human civilization accept its ironies and lend their eternity to its mischievous pranks. It is superb; it has a prodigious 14th of July, which delivers the globe; it forces all nations to take the oath of tennis; its night of the 4th of August dissolves in three hours a thousand years of feudalism; it makes of its logic the muscle of unanimous will; it multiplies itself under all sorts of forms of the sublime; it fills with its light Washington, Kosciusko, Bolivar, Bozzaris, Riego, Bem, Manin, Lopez, John Brown, Garibaldi; it is everywhere where the future is being lighted up, at Boston in 1779, at the Isle de L√©on in 1820, at Pesth in 1848,
U|| at Palermo in 1860, it whispers the mighty countersign: Liberty, in the ear of the American abolitionists grouped about the boat at Harper‚Äôs Ferry, and in the ear of the patriots of Ancona assembled in the shadow, to the Archi before the Gozzi inn on the seashore; it creates Canaris; it creates Quiroga; it creates Pisacane; it irradiates the great on earth; it was while proceeding whither its breath urge them, that Byron perished at Missolonghi, and that Mazet died at Barcelona; it is the tribune under the feet of Mirabeau, and a crater under the feet of Robespierre; its books, its theatre, its art, its science, its literature, its philosophy, are the manuals of the human race; it has Pascal, R√©gnier, Corneille, Descartes, Jean-Jacques: Voltaire for all moments, Moli√®re for all centuries; it makes its language to be talked by the universal mouth, and that language becomes the word; it constructs in all minds the idea of progress, the liberating dogmas which it forges are for the generations trusty frien
U||ds, and it is with the soul of its thinkers and its poets that all heroes of all nations have been made since 1789; this does not prevent vagabondism, and that enormous genius which is called Paris, while transfiguring the world by its light, sketches in charcoal Bouginier‚Äôs nose on the wall of the temple of Theseus and writes Credeville the thief on the Pyramids.
U||Paris is always showing its teeth; when it is not scolding it is laughing.
U||Such is Paris. The smoke of its roofs forms the ideas of the universe. A heap of mud and stone, if you will, but, above all, a moral being. It is more than great, it is immense. Why? Because it is daring.
U||To dare; that is the price of progress.
U||All sublime conquests are, more or less, the prizes of daring. In order that the Revolution should take place, it does not suffice that Montesquieu should foresee it, that Diderot should preach it, that Beaumarchais should announce it, that Condorcet should calculate it, that Arouet should prepare it, that Rousseau should premeditate it; it is necessary that Danton should dare it.
U||The cry: Audacity! is a Fiat lux. It is necessary, for the sake of the forward march of the human race, that there should be proud lessons of courage permanently on the heights. Daring deeds dazzle history and are one of man‚Äôs great sources of light. The dawn dares when it rises. To attempt, to brave, to persist, to persevere, to be faithful to one‚Äôs self, to grasp fate bodily, to astound catastrophe by the small amount of fear that it occasions us, now to affront unjust power, again to insult drunken victory, to hold one‚Äôs position, to stand one‚Äôs ground; that is the example which nations need, that is the light which electrifies them. The same formidable lightning proceeds from the torch of Prometheus to Cambronne‚Äôs short pipe.
U||CHAPTER XII‚ÄîTHE FUTURE LATENT IN THE PEOPLE
U||As for the Parisian populace, even when a man grown, it is always the street Arab; to paint the child is to paint the city; and it is for that reason that we have studied this eagle in this arrant sparrow. It is in the faubourgs, above all, we maintain, that the Parisian race appears; there is the pure blood; there is the true physiognomy; there this people toils and suffers, and suffering and toil are the two faces of man. There exist there immense numbers of unknown beings, among whom swarm types of the strangest, from the porter of la R√¢p√©e to the knacker of Montfaucon. Fex urbis, exclaims Cicero; mob, adds Burke, indignantly; rabble, multitude, populace. These are words and quickly uttered. But so be it. What does it matter? What is it to me if they do go barefoot! They do not know how to read; so much the worse. Would you abandon them for that? Would you turn their distress into a malediction? Cannot the light penetrate these masses? Let us return to that cry: Light! and let us obstinately persist the
U||rein! Light! Light! Who knows whether these opacities will not become transparent? Are not revolutions transfigurations? Come, philosophers, teach, enlighten, light up, think aloud, speak aloud, hasten joyously to the great sun, fraternize with the public place, announce the good news, spend your alphabets lavishly, proclaim rights, sing the Marseillaises, sow enthusiasms, tear green boughs from the oaks. Make a whirlwind of the idea. This crowd may be rendered sublime. Let us learn how to make use of that vast conflagration of principles and virtues, which sparkles, bursts forth and quivers at certain hours. These bare feet, these bare arms, these rags, these ignorances, these abjectnesses, these darknesses, may be employed in the conquest of the ideal. Gaze past the people, and you will perceive truth. Let that vile sand which you trample under foot be cast into the furnace, let it melt and seethe there, it will become a splendid crystal, and it is thanks to it that Galileo and Newton will discover stars.
U||CHAPTER XIII‚ÄîLITTLE GAVROCHE
U||Little Gavroche
U||Eight or nine years after the events narrated in the second part of this story, people noticed on the Boulevard du Temple, and in the regions of the Ch√¢teau-d‚ÄôEau, a little boy eleven or twelve years of age, who would have realized with tolerable accuracy that ideal of the gamin sketched out above, if, with the laugh of his age on his lips, he had not had a heart absolutely sombre and empty. This child was well muffled up in a pair of man‚Äôs trousers, but he did not get them from his father, and a woman‚Äôs chemise, but he did not get it from his mother. Some people or other had clothed him in rags out of charity. Still, he had a father and a mother. But his father did not think of him, and his mother did not love him.
U||He was one of those children most deserving of pity, among all, one of those who have father and mother, and who are orphans nevertheless.
U||This child never felt so well as when he was in the street. The pavements were less hard to him than his mother‚Äôs heart.
U||His parents had despatched him into life with a kick.
U||He simply took flight.
U||He was a boisterous, pallid, nimble, wide-awake, jeering, lad, with a vivacious but sickly air. He went and came, sang, played at hopscotch, scraped the gutters, stole a little, but, like cats and sparrows, gayly laughed when he was called a rogue, and got angry when called a thief. He had no shelter, no bread, no fire, no love; but he was merry because he was free.
U||When these poor creatures grow to be men, the millstones of the social order meet them and crush them, but so long as they are children, they escape because of their smallness. The tiniest hole saves them.
U||Nevertheless, abandoned as this child was, it sometimes happened, every two or three months, that he said, ‚ÄúCome, I‚Äôll go and see mamma!‚Äù Then he quitted the boulevard, the Cirque, the Porte Saint-Martin, descended to the quays, crossed the bridges, reached the suburbs, arrived at the Salp√™tri√®re, and came to a halt, where? Precisely at that double number 50-52 with which the reader is acquainted‚Äîat the Gorbeau hovel.
U||At that epoch, the hovel 50-52 generally deserted and eternally decorated with the placard: ‚ÄúChambers to let,‚Äù chanced to be, a rare thing, inhabited by numerous individuals who, however, as is always the case in Paris, had no connection with each other. All belonged to that indigent class which begins to separate from the lowest of petty bourgeoisie in straitened circumstances, and which extends from misery to misery into the lowest depths of society down to those two beings in whom all the material things of civilization end, the sewer-man who sweeps up the mud, and the rag-picker who collects scraps.
U||The ‚Äúprincipal lodger‚Äù of Jean Valjean‚Äôs day was dead and had been replaced by another exactly like her. I know not what philosopher has said: ‚ÄúOld women are never lacking.‚Äù
U||This new old woman was named Madame Bourgon, and had nothing remarkable about her life except a dynasty of three paroquets, who had reigned in succession over her soul.
U||The most miserable of those who inhabited the hovel were a family of four persons, consisting of father, mother, and two daughters, already well grown, all four of whom were lodged in the same attic, one of the cells which we have already mentioned.
U||At first sight, this family presented no very special feature except its extreme destitution; the father, when he hired the chamber, had stated that his name was Jondrette. Some time after his moving in, which had borne a singular resemblance to the entrance of nothing at all, to borrow the memorable expression of the principal tenant, this Jondrette had said to the woman, who, like her predecessor, was at the same time portress and stair-sweeper: ‚ÄúMother So-and-So, if any one should chance to come and inquire for a Pole or an Italian, or even a Spaniard, perchance, it is I.‚Äù
U||This family was that of the merry barefoot boy. He arrived there and found distress, and, what is still sadder, no smile; a cold hearth and cold hearts. When he entered, he was asked: ‚ÄúWhence come you?‚Äù He replied: ‚ÄúFrom the street.‚Äù When he went away, they asked him: ‚ÄúWhither are you going?‚Äù He replied: ‚ÄúInto the streets.‚Äù His mother said to him: ‚ÄúWhat did you come here for?‚Äù
U||This child lived, in this absence of affection, like the pale plants which spring up in cellars. It did not cause him suffering, and he blamed no one. He did not know exactly how a father and mother should be.
U||Nevertheless, his mother loved his sisters.
U||We have forgotten to mention, that on the Boulevard du Temple this child was called Little Gavroche. Why was he called Little Gavroche?
U||Probably because his father‚Äôs name was Jondrette.
U||It seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break the thread.
U||The chamber which the Jondrettes inhabited in the Gorbeau hovel was the last at the end of the corridor. The cell next to it was occupied by a very poor young man who was called M. Marius.
U||Let us explain who this M. Marius was.
U||BOOK SECOND‚ÄîTHE GREAT BOURGEOIS
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîNINETY YEARS AND THIRTY-TWO TEETH
U||In the Rue Boucherat, Rue de Normandie and the Rue de Saintonge there still exist a few ancient inhabitants who have preserved the memory of a worthy man named M. Gillenormand, and who mention him with complaisance. This good man was old when they were young. This silhouette has not yet entirely disappeared‚Äîfor those who regard with melancholy that vague swarm of shadows which is called the past‚Äîfrom the labyrinth of streets in the vicinity of the Temple to which, under Louis XIV., the names of all the provinces of France were appended exactly as in our day, the streets of the new Tivoli quarter have received the names of all the capitals of Europe; a progression, by the way, in which progress is visible.
U||M. Gillenormand, who was as much alive as possible in 1831, was one of those men who had become curiosities to be viewed, simply because they have lived a long time, and who are strange because they formerly resembled everybody, and now resemble nobody. He was a peculiar old man, and in very truth, a man of another age, the real, complete and rather haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century, who wore his good, old bourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their marquisates. He was over ninety years of age, his walk was erect, he talked loudly, saw clearly, drank neat, ate, slept, and snored. He had all thirty-two of his teeth. He only wore spectacles when he read. He was of an amorous disposition, but declared that, for the last ten years, he had wholly and decidedly renounced women. He could no longer please, he said; he did not add: ‚ÄúI am too old,‚Äù but: ‚ÄúI am too poor.‚Äù He said: ‚ÄúIf I were not ruined‚ÄîH√©√©e!‚Äù All he had left, in fact, was an income of about fifteen thousand francs.
U|| His dream was to come into an inheritance and to have a hundred thousand livres income for mistresses. He did not belong, as the reader will perceive, to that puny variety of octogenaries who, like M. de Voltaire, have been dying all their life; his was no longevity of a cracked pot; this jovial old man had always had good health. He was superficial, rapid, easily angered. He flew into a passion at everything, generally quite contrary to all reason. When contradicted, he raised his cane; he beat people as he had done in the great century. He had a daughter over fifty years of age, and unmarried, whom he chastised severely with his tongue, when in a rage, and whom he would have liked to whip. She seemed to him to be eight years old. He boxed his servants‚Äô ears soundly, and said: ‚ÄúAh! carogne!‚Äù One of his oaths was: ‚ÄúBy the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade!‚Äù He had singular freaks of tranquillity; he had himself shaved every day by a barber who had been mad and who detested him, being jealous of M
U||. Gillenormand on account of his wife, a pretty and coquettish barberess. M. Gillenormand admired his own discernment in all things, and declared that he was extremely sagacious; here is one of his sayings: ‚ÄúI have, in truth, some penetration; I am able to say when a flea bites me, from what woman it came.‚Äù
U||The words which he uttered the most frequently were: the sensible man, and nature. He did not give to this last word the grand acceptation which our epoch has accorded to it, but he made it enter, after his own fashion, into his little chimney-corner satires: ‚ÄúNature,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúin order that civilization may have a little of everything, gives it even specimens of its amusing barbarism. Europe possesses specimens of Asia and Africa on a small scale. The cat is a drawing-room tiger, the lizard is a pocket crocodile. The dancers at the opera are pink female savages. They do not eat men, they crunch them; or, magicians that they are, they transform them into oysters and swallow them. The Caribbeans leave only the bones, they leave only the shell. Such are our morals. We do not devour, we gnaw; we do not exterminate, we claw.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîLIKE MASTER, LIKE HOUSE
U||He lived in the Marais, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6. He owned the house. This house has since been demolished and rebuilt, and the number has probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which the streets of Paris undergo. He occupied an ancient and vast apartment on the first floor, between street and gardens, furnished to the very ceilings with great Gobelins and Beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes; the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were repeated in miniature on the armchairs. He enveloped his bed in a vast, nine-leaved screen of Coromandel lacquer. Long, full curtains hung from the windows, and formed great, broken folds that were very magnificent. The garden situated immediately under his windows was attached to that one of them which formed the angle, by means of a staircase twelve or fifteen steps long, which the old gentleman ascended and descended with great agility. In addition to a library adjoining his chamber, he had a boudoir of which he thought a great d
U||eal, a gallant and elegant retreat, with magnificent hangings of straw, with a pattern of flowers and fleurs-de-lys made on the galleys of Louis XIV. and ordered of his convicts by M. de Vivonne for his mistress. M. Gillenormand had inherited it from a grim maternal great-aunt, who had died a centenarian. He had had two wives. His manners were something between those of the courtier, which he had never been, and the lawyer, which he might have been. He was gay, and caressing when he had a mind. In his youth he had been one of those men who are always deceived by their wives and never by their mistresses, because they are, at the same time, the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of lovers in existence. He was a connoisseur of painting. He had in his chamber a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom, painted by Jordaens, executed with great dashes of the brush, with millions of details, in a confused and hap-hazard manner. M. Gillenormand‚Äôs attire was not the habit of Louis XIV. nor yet that of L
U||ouis XVI.; it was that of the Incroyables of the Directory. He had thought himself young up to that period and had followed the fashions. His coat was of light-weight cloth with voluminous revers, a long swallow-tail and large steel buttons. With this he wore knee-breeches and buckle shoes. He always thrust his hands into his fobs. He said authoritatively: ‚ÄúThe French Revolution is a heap of blackguards.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîLUC-ESPRIT
U||At the age of sixteen, one evening at the opera, he had had the honor to be stared at through opera-glasses by two beauties at the same time‚Äîripe and celebrated beauties then, and sung by Voltaire, the Camargo and the Sall√©. Caught between two fires, he had beaten a heroic retreat towards a little dancer, a young girl named Nahenry, who was sixteen like himself, obscure as a cat, and with whom he was in love. He abounded in memories. He was accustomed to exclaim: ‚ÄúHow pretty she was‚Äîthat Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette, the last time I saw her at Longchamps, her hair curled in sustained sentiments, with her come-and-see of turquoises, her gown of the color of persons newly arrived, and her little agitation muff!‚Äù He had worn in his young manhood a waistcoat of Nain-Londrin, which he was fond of talking about effusively. ‚ÄúI was dressed like a Turk of the Levant Levantin,‚Äù said he. Madame de Boufflers, having seen him by chance when he was twenty, had described him as ‚Äúa charming fool.‚Äù He wa
U||s horrified by all the names which he saw in politics and in power, regarding them as vulgar and bourgeois. He read the journals, the newspapers, the gazettes as he said, stifling outbursts of laughter the while. ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwhat people these are! Corbi√®re! Humann! Casimir P√©rier! There‚Äôs a minister for you! I can imagine this in a journal: ‚ÄòM. Gillenorman, minister!‚Äô that would be a farce. Well! They are so stupid that it would pass‚Äù; he merrily called everything by its name, whether decent or indecent, and did not restrain himself in the least before ladies. He uttered coarse speeches, obscenities, and filth with a certain tranquillity and lack of astonishment which was elegant. It was in keeping with the unceremoniousness of his century. It is to be noted that the age of periphrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose. His god-father had predicted that he would turn out a man of genius, and had bestowed on him these two significant names: Luc-Esprit.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîA CENTENARIAN ASPIRANT
U||He had taken prizes in his boyhood at the College of Moulins, where he was born, and he had been crowned by the hand of the Duc de Nivernais, whom he called the Duc de Nevers. Neither the Convention, nor the death of Louis XVI., nor the Napoleon, nor the return of the Bourbons, nor anything else had been able to efface the memory of this crowning. The Duc de Nevers was, in his eyes, the great figure of the century. ‚ÄúWhat a charming grand seigneur,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand what a fine air he had with his blue ribbon!‚Äù
U||In the eyes of M. Gillenormand, Catherine the Second had made reparation for the crime of the partition of Poland by purchasing, for three thousand roubles, the secret of the elixir of gold, from Bestucheff. He grew animated on this subject: ‚ÄúThe elixir of gold,‚Äù he exclaimed, ‚Äúthe yellow dye of Bestucheff, General Lamotte‚Äôs drops, in the eighteenth century,‚Äîthis was the great remedy for the catastrophes of love, the panacea against Venus, at one louis the half-ounce phial. Louis XV. sent two hundred phials of it to the Pope.‚Äù He would have been greatly irritated and thrown off his balance, had any one told him that the elixir of gold is nothing but the perchloride of iron. M. Gillenormand adored the Bourbons, and had a horror of 1789; he was forever narrating in what manner he had saved himself during the Terror, and how he had been obliged to display a vast deal of gayety and cleverness in order to escape having his head cut off. If any young man ventured to pronounce an eulogium on the Republi
U||c in his presence, he turned purple and grew so angry that he was on the point of swooning. He sometimes alluded to his ninety years, and said, ‚ÄúI hope that I shall not see ninety-three twice.‚Äù On these occasions, he hinted to people that he meant to live to be a hundred.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîBASQUE AND NICOLETTE
U||He had theories. Here is one of them: ‚ÄúWhen a man is passionately fond of women, and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares but little, who is homely, cross, legitimate, with plenty of rights, perched on the code, and jealous at need, there is but one way of extricating himself from the quandry and of procuring peace, and that is to let his wife control the purse-strings. This abdication sets him free. Then his wife busies herself, grows passionately fond of handling coin, gets her fingers covered with verdigris in the process, undertakes the education of half-share tenants and the training of farmers, convokes lawyers, presides over notaries, harangues scriveners, visits limbs of the law, follows lawsuits, draws up leases, dictates contracts, feels herself the sovereign, sells, buys, regulates, promises and compromises, binds fast and annuls, yields, concedes and retrocedes, arranges, disarranges, hoards, lavishes; she commits follies, a supreme and personal delight, and that consoles her. While her
U|| husband disdains her, she has the satisfaction of ruining her husband.‚Äù This theory M. Gillenormand had himself applied, and it had become his history. His wife‚Äîthe second one‚Äîhad administered his fortune in such a manner that, one fine day, when M. Gillenormand found himself a widower, there remained to him just sufficient to live on, by sinking nearly the whole of it in an annuity of fifteen thousand francs, three-quarters of which would expire with him. He had not hesitated on this point, not being anxious to leave a property behind him. Besides, he had noticed that patrimonies are subject to adventures, and, for instance, become national property; he had been present at the avatars of consolidated three per cents, and he had no great faith in the Great Book of the Public Debt. ‚ÄúAll that‚Äôs the Rue Quincampois!‚Äù he said. His house in the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire belonged to him, as we have already stated. He had two servants, ‚Äúa male and a female.‚Äù When a servant entered his establishmen
U||t, M. Gillenormand re-baptized him. He bestowed on the men the name of their province: N√Æmois, Comtois, Poitevin, Picard. His last valet was a big, foundered, short-winded fellow of fifty-five, who was incapable of running twenty paces; but, as he had been born at Bayonne, M. Gillenormand called him Basque. All the female servants in his house were called Nicolette (even the Magnon, of whom we shall hear more farther on). One day, a haughty cook, a cordon bleu, of the lofty race of porters, presented herself. ‚ÄúHow much wages do you want a month?‚Äù asked M. Gillenormand. ‚ÄúThirty francs.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù ‚ÄúOlympie.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou shall have fifty francs, and you shall be called Nicolette.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîIN WHICH MAGNON AND HER TWO CHILDREN ARE SEEN
U||With M. Gillenormand, sorrow was converted into wrath; he was furious at being in despair. He had all sorts of prejudices and took all sorts of liberties. One of the facts of which his exterior relief and his internal satisfaction was composed, was, as we have just hinted, that he had remained a brisk spark, and that he passed energetically for such. This he called having ‚Äúroyal renown.‚Äù This royal renown sometimes drew down upon him singular windfalls. One day, there was brought to him in a basket, as though it had been a basket of oysters, a stout, newly born boy, who was yelling like the deuce, and duly wrapped in swaddling-clothes, which a servant-maid, dismissed six months previously, attributed to him. M. Gillenormand had, at that time, fully completed his eighty-fourth year. Indignation and uproar in the establishment. And whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to believe that? What audacity! What an abominable calumny! M. Gillenormand himself was not at all enraged. He gazed at the bra
U||t with the amiable smile of a good man who is flattered by the calumny, and said in an aside: ‚ÄúWell, what now? What‚Äôs the matter? You are finely taken aback, and really, you are excessively ignorant. M. le Duc d‚ÄôAngoul√™me, the bastard of his Majesty Charles IX., married a silly jade of fifteen when he was eighty-five; M. Virginal, Marquis d‚ÄôAlluye, brother to the Cardinal de Sourdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux, had, at the age of eighty-three, by the maid of Madame la Pr√©sidente Jacquin, a son, a real child of love, who became a Chevalier of Malta and a counsellor of state; one of the great men of this century, the Abb√© Tabaraud, is the son of a man of eighty-seven. There is nothing out of the ordinary in these things. And then, the Bible! Upon that I declare that this little gentleman is none of mine. Let him be taken care of. It is not his fault.‚Äù This manner of procedure was good-tempered. The woman, whose name was Magnon, sent him another parcel in the following year. It was a boy again. Thereup
U||on, M. Gillenormand capitulated. He sent the two brats back to their mother, promising to pay eighty francs a month for their maintenance, on the condition that the said mother would not do so any more. He added: ‚ÄúI insist upon it that the mother shall treat them well. I shall go to see them from time to time.‚Äù And this he did. He had had a brother who was a priest, and who had been rector of the Academy of Poitiers for three and thirty years, and had died at seventy-nine. ‚ÄúI lost him young,‚Äù said he. This brother, of whom but little memory remains, was a peaceable miser, who, being a priest, thought himself bound to bestow alms on the poor whom he met, but he never gave them anything except bad or demonetized sous, thereby discovering a means of going to hell by way of paradise. As for M. Gillenormand the elder, he never haggled over his alms-giving, but gave gladly and nobly. He was kindly, abrupt, charitable, and if he had been rich, his turn of mind would have been magnificent. He desired that al
U||l which concerned him should be done in a grand manner, even his rogueries. One day, having been cheated by a business man in a matter of inheritance, in a gross and apparent manner, he uttered this solemn exclamation: ‚ÄúThat was indecently done! I am really ashamed of this pilfering. Everything has degenerated in this century, even the rascals. Morbleu! this is not the way to rob a man of my standing. I am robbed as though in a forest, but badly robbed. Silv√¶ sint consule dign√¶! ‚Äù He had had two wives, as we have already mentioned; by the first he had had a daughter, who had remained unmarried, and by the second another daughter, who had died at about the age of thirty, who had wedded, through love, or chance, or otherwise, a soldier of fortune who had served in the armies of the Republic and of the Empire, who had won the cross at Austerlitz and had been made colonel at Waterloo. ‚ÄúHe is the disgrace of my family,‚Äù said the old bourgeois. He took an immense amount of snuff, and had a particularly g
U||raceful manner of plucking at his lace ruffle with the back of one hand. He believed very little in God.
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîRULE: RECEIVE NO ONE EXCEPT IN THE EVENING
U||Such was M. Luc-Esprit Gillenormand, who had not lost his hair,‚Äîwhich was gray rather than white,‚Äîand which was always dressed in ‚Äúdog‚Äôs ears.‚Äù To sum up, he was venerable in spite of all this.
U||He had something of the eighteenth century about him; frivolous and great.
U||In 1814 and during the early years of the Restoration, M. Gillenormand, who was still young,‚Äîhe was only seventy-four,‚Äîlived in the Faubourg Saint Germain, Rue Servandoni, near Saint-Sulpice. He had only retired to the Marais when he quitted society, long after attaining the age of eighty.
U||And, on abandoning society, he had immured himself in his habits. The principal one, and that which was invariable, was to keep his door absolutely closed during the day, and never to receive any one whatever except in the evening. He dined at five o‚Äôclock, and after that his door was open. That had been the fashion of his century, and he would not swerve from it. ‚ÄúThe day is vulgar,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúand deserves only a closed shutter. Fashionable people only light up their minds when the zenith lights up its stars.‚Äù And he barricaded himself against every one, even had it been the king himself. This was the antiquated elegance of his day.
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîTWO DO NOT MAKE A PAIR
U||We have just spoken of M. Gillenormand‚Äôs two daughters. They had come into the world ten years apart. In their youth they had borne very little resemblance to each other, either in character or countenance, and had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible. The youngest had a charming soul, which turned towards all that belongs to the light, was occupied with flowers, with verses, with music, which fluttered away into glorious space, enthusiastic, ethereal, and was wedded from her very youth, in ideal, to a vague and heroic figure. The elder had also her chimera; she espied in the azure some very wealthy purveyor, a contractor, a splendidly stupid husband, a million made man, or even a prefect; the receptions of the Prefecture, an usher in the antechamber with a chain on his neck, official balls, the harangues of the town-hall, to be ‚ÄúMadame la Pr√©f√®te,‚Äù‚Äîall this had created a whirlwind in her imagination. Thus the two sisters strayed, each in her own dream, at the epoch when they 
U||were young girls. Both had wings, the one like an angel, the other like a goose.
U||No ambition is ever fully realized, here below at least. No paradise becomes terrestrial in our day. The younger wedded the man of her dreams, but she died. The elder did not marry at all.
U||At the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we are relating, she was an antique virtue, an incombustible prude, with one of the sharpest noses, and one of the most obtuse minds that it is possible to see. A characteristic detail; outside of her immediate family, no one had ever known her first name. She was called Mademoiselle Gillenormand, the elder.
U||In the matter of cant, Mademoiselle Gillenormand could have given points to a miss. Her modesty was carried to the other extreme of blackness. She cherished a frightful memory of her life; one day, a man had beheld her garter.
U||Age had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty. Her guimpe was never sufficiently opaque, and never ascended sufficiently high. She multiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking. The peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more sentinels in proportion as the fortress is the less menaced.
U||Nevertheless, let him who can explain these antique mysteries of innocence, she allowed an officer of the Lancers, her grand nephew, named Th√©odule, to embrace her without displeasure.
U||In spite of this favored Lancer, the label: Prude, under which we have classed her, suited her to absolute perfection. Mademoiselle Gillenormand was a sort of twilight soul. Prudery is a demi-virtue and a demi-vice.
U||To prudery she added bigotry, a well-assorted lining. She belonged to the society of the Virgin, wore a white veil on certain festivals, mumbled special orisons, revered ‚Äúthe holy blood,‚Äù venerated ‚Äúthe sacred heart,‚Äù remained for hours in contemplation before a rococo-jesuit altar in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank and file of the faithful, and there allowed her soul to soar among little clouds of marble, and through great rays of gilded wood.
U||She had a chapel friend, an ancient virgin like herself, named Mademoiselle Vaubois, who was a positive blockhead, and beside whom Mademoiselle Gillenormand had the pleasure of being an eagle. Beyond the Agnus Dei and Ave Maria, Mademoiselle Vaubois had no knowledge of anything except of the different ways of making preserves. Mademoiselle Vaubois, perfect in her style, was the ermine of stupidity without a single spot of intelligence.
U||Let us say it plainly, Mademoiselle Gillenormand had gained rather than lost as she grew older. This is the case with passive natures. She had never been malicious, which is relative kindness; and then, years wear away the angles, and the softening which comes with time had come to her. She was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not herself know the secret. There breathed from her whole person the stupor of a life that was finished, and which had never had a beginning.
U||She kept house for her father. M. Gillenormand had his daughter near him, as we have seen that Monseigneur Bienvenu had his sister with him. These households comprised of an old man and an old spinster are not rare, and always have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning on each other for support.
U||There was also in this house, between this elderly spinster and this old man, a child, a little boy, who was always trembling and mute in the presence of M. Gillenormand. M. Gillenormand never addressed this child except in a severe voice, and sometimes, with uplifted cane: ‚ÄúHere, sir! rascal, scoundrel, come here!‚ÄîAnswer me, you scamp! Just let me see you, you good-for-nothing!‚Äù etc., etc. He idolized him.
U||This was his grandson. We shall meet with this child again later on.
U||BOOK THIRD‚ÄîTHE GRANDFATHER AND THE GRANDSON
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîAN ANCIENT SALON
U||When M. Gillenormand lived in the Rue Servandoni, he had frequented many very good and very aristocratic salons. Although a bourgeois, M. Gillenormand was received in society. As he had a double measure of wit, in the first place, that which was born with him, and secondly, that which was attributed to him, he was even sought out and made much of. He never went anywhere except on condition of being the chief person there. There are people who will have influence at any price, and who will have other people busy themselves over them; when they cannot be oracles, they turn wags. M. Gillenormand was not of this nature; his domination in the Royalist salons which he frequented cost his self-respect nothing. He was an oracle everywhere. It had happened to him to hold his own against M. de Bonald, and even against M. Bengy-Puy-Vall√©e.
U||About 1817, he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house in his own neighborhood, in the Rue F√©rou, with Madame la Baronne de T., a worthy and respectable person, whose husband had been Ambassador of France to Berlin under Louis XVI. Baron de T., who, during his lifetime, had gone very passionately into ecstasies and magnetic visions, had died bankrupt, during the emigration, leaving, as his entire fortune, some very curious Memoirs about Mesmer and his tub, in ten manuscript volumes, bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges. Madame de T. had not published the memoirs, out of pride, and maintained herself on a meagre income which had survived no one knew how.
U||Madame de T. lived far from the Court; ‚Äúa very mixed society,‚Äù as she said, in a noble isolation, proud and poor. A few friends assembled twice a week about her widowed hearth, and these constituted a purely Royalist salon. They sipped tea there, and uttered groans or cries of horror at the century, the charter, the Bonapartists, the prostitution of the blue ribbon, or the Jacobinism of Louis XVIII., according as the wind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs; and they spoke in low tones of the hopes which were presented by Monsieur, afterwards Charles X.
U||The songs of the fishwomen, in which Napoleon was called Nicolas, were received there with transports of joy. Duchesses, the most delicate and charming women in the world, went into ecstasies over couplets like the following, addressed to ‚Äúthe federates‚Äù:‚Äî
U||Refoncez dans vos culottes
U||Le bout d‚Äô chemis‚Äô qui vous pend.
U||Qu‚Äôon n‚Äô dis‚Äô pas qu‚Äô les patriotes
U||Ont arbor√© l‚Äô drapeau blanc?20
U||There they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible, with innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous, with quatrains, with distiches even; thus, upon the Dessolles ministry, a moderate cabinet, of which MM. Decazes and Deserre were members:‚Äî
U||Pour raffermir le tr√¥ne √©branl√© sur sa base,
U||Il faut changer de sol, et de serre et de case.21
U||Or they drew up a list of the chamber of peers, ‚Äúan abominably Jacobin chamber,‚Äù and from this list they combined alliances of names, in such a manner as to form, for example, phrases like the following: Damas. Sabran. Gouvion-Saint-Cyr.‚ÄîAll this was done merrily. In that society, they parodied the Revolution. They used I know not what desires to give point to the same wrath in inverse sense. They sang their little √áa ira: ‚Äî
U||Ah! √ßa ira √ßa ira √ßa ira!
U||Les Bonapartistes √† la lanterne!
U||Songs are like the guillotine; they chop away indifferently, to-day this head, to-morrow that. It is only a variation.
U||In the Fuald√®s affair, which belongs to this epoch, 1816, they took part for Bastide and Jausion, because Fuald√®s was ‚Äúa Buonapartist.‚Äù They designated the liberals as friends and brothers; this constituted the most deadly insult.
U||Like certain church towers, Madame de T.‚Äôs salon had two cocks. One of them was M. Gillenormand, the other was Comte de Lamothe-Valois, of whom it was whispered about, with a sort of respect: ‚ÄúDo you know? That is the Lamothe of the affair of the necklace.‚Äù These singular amnesties do occur in parties.
U||Let us add the following: in the bourgeoisie, honored situations decay through too easy relations; one must beware whom one admits; in the same way that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those who are cold, there is a diminution of consideration in the approach of despised persons. The ancient society of the upper classes held themselves above this law, as above every other. Marigny, the brother of the Pompadour, had his entry with M. le Prince de Soubise. In spite of? No, because. Du Barry, the god-father of the Vaubernier, was very welcome at the house of M. le Mar√©chal de Richelieu. This society is Olympus. Mercury and the Prince de Gu√©men√©e are at home there. A thief is admitted there, provided he be a god.
U||The Comte de Lamothe, who, in 1815, was an old man seventy-five years of age, had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and sententious air, his cold and angular face, his perfectly polished manners, his coat buttoned up to his cravat, and his long legs always crossed in long, flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna. His face was the same color as his trousers.
U||This M. de Lamothe was ‚Äúheld in consideration‚Äù in this salon on account of his ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù and, strange to say, though true, because of his name of Valois.
U||As for M. Gillenormand, his consideration was of absolutely first-rate quality. He had, in spite of his levity, and without its interfering in any way with his dignity, a certain manner about him which was imposing, dignified, honest, and lofty, in a bourgeois fashion; and his great age added to it. One is not a century with impunity. The years finally produce around a head a venerable dishevelment.
U||In addition to this, he said things which had the genuine sparkle of the old rock. Thus, when the King of Prussia, after having restored Louis XVIII., came to pay the latter a visit under the name of the Count de Ruppin, he was received by the descendant of Louis XIV. somewhat as though he had been the Marquis de Brandebourg, and with the most delicate impertinence. M. Gillenormand approved: ‚ÄúAll kings who are not the King of France,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúare provincial kings.‚Äù One day, the following question was put and the following answer returned in his presence: ‚ÄúTo what was the editor of the Courrier Fran√ßais condemned?‚Äù ‚ÄúTo be suspended.‚Äù ‚ÄúSus is superfluous,‚Äù observed M. Gillenormand.22 Remarks of this nature found a situation.
U||At the Te Deum on the anniversary of the return of the Bourbons, he said, on seeing M. de Talleyrand pass by: ‚ÄúThere goes his Excellency the Evil One.‚Äù
U||M. Gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter, that tall mademoiselle, who was over forty and looked fifty, and by a handsome little boy of seven years, white, rosy, fresh, with happy and trusting eyes, who never appeared in that salon without hearing voices murmur around him: ‚ÄúHow handsome he is! What a pity! Poor child!‚Äù This child was the one of whom we dropped a word a while ago. He was called ‚Äúpoor child,‚Äù because he had for a father ‚Äúa brigand of the Loire.‚Äù
U||This brigand of the Loire was M. Gillenormand‚Äôs son-in-law, who has already been mentioned, and whom M. Gillenormand called ‚Äúthe disgrace of his family.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîONE OF THE RED SPECTRES OF THAT EPOCH
U||Any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of Vernon at this epoch, and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental bridge, which will soon be succeeded, let us hope, by some hideous iron cable bridge, might have observed, had he dropped his eyes over the parapet, a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap, and trousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth, to which something yellow which had been a red ribbon, was sewn, shod with wooden sabots, tanned by the sun, his face nearly black and his hair nearly white, a large scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek, bowed, bent, prematurely aged, who walked nearly every day, hoe and sickle in hand, in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the bridge, and border the left bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces, charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say, were they much larger: ‚Äúthese are gardens,‚Äù and were they a little smaller: ‚Äúthese are bouquets.‚Äù All these enclosures abu
U||t upon the river at one end, and on a house at the other. The man in the waistcoat and the wooden shoes of whom we have just spoken, inhabited the smallest of these enclosures and the most humble of these houses about 1817. He lived there alone and solitary, silently and poorly, with a woman who was neither young nor old, neither homely nor pretty, neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise, who served him. The plot of earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there. These flowers were his occupation.
U||By dint of labor, of perseverance, of attention, and of buckets of water, he had succeeded in creating after the Creator, and he had invented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been forgotten by nature. He was ingenious; he had forestalled Soulange Bodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould, for the cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from America and China. He was in his alleys from the break of day, in summer, planting, cutting, hoeing, watering, walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness, sadness, and sweetness, sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful for hours, listening to the song of a bird in the trees, the babble of a child in a house, or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear of grass, of which the sun made a carbuncle. His table was very plain, and he drank more milk than wine. A child could make him give way, and his servant scolded him. He was so timid that he seemed shy, he rarely went out, and he saw no one but the poo
U||r people who tapped at his pane and his cur√©, the Abb√© Mabeuf, a good old man. Nevertheless, if the inhabitants of the town, or strangers, or any chance comers, curious to see his tulips, rang at his little cottage, he opened his door with a smile. He was the ‚Äúbrigand of the Loire.‚Äù
U||Any one who had, at the same time, read military memoirs, biographies, the Moniteur, and the bulletins of the grand army, would have been struck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency, the name of Georges Pontmercy. When very young, this Georges Pontmercy had been a soldier in Saintonge‚Äôs regiment. The revolution broke out. Saintonge‚Äôs regiment formed a part of the army of the Rhine; for the old regiments of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall of the monarchy, and were only divided into brigades in 1794. Pontmercy fought at Spire, at Worms, at Neustadt, at Turkheim, at Alzey, at Mayence, where he was one of the two hundred who formed Houchard‚Äôs rearguard. It was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corps of the Prince of Hesse, behind the old rampart of Andernach, and only rejoined the main body of the army when the enemy‚Äôs cannon had opened a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis. He was under Kl√©ber at Marchiennes and at 
U||the battle of Mont-Palissel, where a ball from a bisca√Øen broke his arm. Then he passed to the frontier of Italy, and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the Col de Tende with Joubert. Joubert was appointed its adjutant-general, and Pontmercy sub-lieutenant. Pontmercy was by Berthier‚Äôs side in the midst of the grape-shot of that day at Lodi which caused Bonaparte to say: ‚ÄúBerthier has been cannoneer, cavalier, and grenadier.‚Äù He beheld his old general, Joubert, fall at Novi, at the moment when, with uplifted sabre, he was shouting: ‚ÄúForward!‚Äù Having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of the campaign, on board a pinnace which was proceeding from Genoa to some obscure port on the coast, he fell into a wasps‚Äô-nest of seven or eight English vessels. The Genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea, to hide the soldiers between decks, and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel. Pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak, and sailed proudly past under the
U|| guns of the British frigates. Twenty leagues further on, his audacity having increased, he attacked with his pinnace, and captured a large English transport which was carrying troops to Sicily, and which was so loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea. In 1805 he was in that Malher division which took G√ºnzberg from the Archduke Ferdinand. At Weltingen he received into his arms, beneath a storm of bullets, Colonel Maupetit, mortally wounded at the head of the 9th Dragoons. He distinguished himself at Austerlitz in that admirable march in echelons effected under the enemy‚Äôs fire. When the cavalry of the Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of the line, Pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the Guard. The Emperor gave him the cross. Pontmercy saw Wurmser at Mantua, M√©las, and Alexandria, Mack at Ulm, made prisoners in succession. He formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which Mortier commanded, and which captur
U||ed Hamburg. Then he was transferred to the 55th of the line, which was the old regiment of Flanders. At Eylau he was in the cemetery where, for the space of two hours, the heroic Captain Louis Hugo, the uncle of the author of this book, sustained alone with his company of eighty-three men every effort of the hostile army. Pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that cemetery. He was at Friedland. Then he saw Moscow. Then La B√©r√©sina, then Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, Wachau, Leipzig, and the defiles of Gelenhausen; then Montmirail, Ch√¢teau-Thierry, Craon, the banks of the Marne, the banks of the Aisne, and the redoubtable position of Laon. At Arnay-Le-Duc, being then a captain, he put ten Cossacks to the sword, and saved, not his general, but his corporal. He was well slashed up on this occasion, and twenty-seven splinters were extracted from his left arm alone. Eight days before the capitulation of Paris he had just exchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry. He had what was called under
U|| the old regime, the double hand, that is to say, an equal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier, or a squadron or a battalion as an officer. It is from this aptitude, perfected by a military education, which certain special branches of the service arise, the dragoons, for example, who are both cavalry-men and infantry at one and the same time. He accompanied Napoleon to the Island of Elba. At Waterloo, he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers, in Dubois‚Äô brigade. It was he who captured the standard of the Lunenburg battalion. He came and cast the flag at the Emperor‚Äôs feet. He was covered with blood. While tearing down the banner he had received a sword-cut across his face. The Emperor, greatly pleased, shouted to him: ‚ÄúYou are a colonel, you are a baron, you are an officer of the Legion of Honor!‚Äù Pontmercy replied: ‚ÄúSire, I thank you for my widow.‚Äù An hour later, he fell in the ravine of Ohain. Now, who was this Georges Pontmercy? He was this same ‚Äúbrigand of the Loire.
U||‚Äù
U||We have already seen something of his history. After Waterloo, Pontmercy, who had been pulled out of the hollow road of Ohain, as it will be remembered, had succeeded in joining the army, and had dragged himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the Loire.
U||The Restoration had placed him on half-pay, then had sent him into residence, that is to say, under surveillance, at Vernon. King Louis XVIII., regarding all that which had taken place during the Hundred Days as not having occurred at all, did not recognize his quality as an officer of the Legion of Honor, nor his grade of colonel, nor his title of baron. He, on his side, neglected no occasion of signing himself ‚ÄúColonel Baron Pontmercy.‚Äù He had only an old blue coat, and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the Legion of Honor. The Attorney for the Crown had him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for ‚Äúillegal‚Äù wearing of this decoration. When this notice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary, Pontmercy retorted with a bitter smile: ‚ÄúI do not know whether I no longer understand French, or whether you no longer speak it; but the fact is that I do not understand.‚Äù Then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette. They dared n
U||ot interfere with him. Two or three times the Minister of War and the general in command of the department wrote to him with the following address: ‚ÄúA Monsieur le Commandant Pontmercy.‚Äù He sent back the letters with the seals unbroken. At the same moment, Napoleon at Saint Helena was treating in the same fashion the missives of Sir Hudson Lowe addressed to General Bonaparte. Pontmercy had ended, may we be pardoned the expression, by having in his mouth the same saliva as his Emperor.
U||In the same way, there were at Rome Carthaginian prisoners who refused to salute Flaminius, and who had a little of Hannibal‚Äôs spirit.
U||One day he encountered the district-attorney in one of the streets of Vernon, stepped up to him, and said: ‚ÄúMr. Crown Attorney, am I permitted to wear my scar?‚Äù
U||He had nothing save his meagre half-pay as chief of squadron. He had hired the smallest house which he could find at Vernon. He lived there alone, we have just seen how. Under the Empire, between two wars, he had found time to marry Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The old bourgeois, thoroughly indignant at bottom, had given his consent with a sigh, saying: ‚ÄúThe greatest families are forced into it.‚Äù In 1815, Madame Pontmercy, an admirable woman in every sense, by the way, lofty in sentiment and rare, and worthy of her husband, died, leaving a child. This child had been the colonel‚Äôs joy in his solitude; but the grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson, declaring that if the child were not given to him he would disinherit him. The father had yielded in the little one‚Äôs interest, and had transferred his love to flowers.
U||Moreover, he had renounced everything, and neither stirred up mischief nor conspired. He shared his thoughts between the innocent things which he was then doing and the great things which he had done. He passed his time in expecting a pink or in recalling Austerlitz.
U||M. Gillenormand kept up no relations with his son-in-law. The colonel was ‚Äúa bandit‚Äù to him. M. Gillenormand never mentioned the colonel, except when he occasionally made mocking allusions to ‚Äúhis Baronship.‚Äù It had been expressly agreed that Pontmercy should never attempt to see his son nor to speak to him, under penalty of having the latter handed over to him disowned and disinherited. For the Gillenormands, Pontmercy was a man afflicted with the plague. They intended to bring up the child in their own way. Perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions, but he submitted to them, thinking that he was doing right and sacrificing no one but himself.
U||The inheritance of Father Gillenormand did not amount to much; but the inheritance of Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder was considerable. This aunt, who had remained unmarried, was very rich on the maternal side, and her sister‚Äôs son was her natural heir. The boy, whose name was Marius, knew that he had a father, but nothing more. No one opened his mouth to him about it. Nevertheless, in the society into which his grandfather took him, whispers, innuendoes, and winks, had eventually enlightened the little boy‚Äôs mind; he had finally understood something of the case, and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were, so to speak, the air he breathed, by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration, he gradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain at his heart.
U||While he was growing up in this fashion, the colonel slipped away every two or three months, came to Paris on the sly, like a criminal breaking his ban, and went and posted himself at Saint-Sulpice, at the hour when Aunt Gillenormand led Marius to the mass. There, trembling lest the aunt should turn round, concealed behind a pillar, motionless, not daring to breathe, he gazed at his child. The scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster.
U||From this had arisen his connection with the cur√© of Vernon, M. l‚ÄôAbb√© Mabeuf.
U||That worthy priest was the brother of a warden of Saint-Sulpice, who had often observed this man gazing at his child, and the scar on his cheek, and the large tears in his eyes. That man, who had so manly an air, yet who was weeping like a woman, had struck the warden. That face had clung to his mind. One day, having gone to Vernon to see his brother, he had encountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge, and had recognized the man of Saint-Sulpice. The warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cur√©, and both had paid the colonel a visit, on some pretext or other. This visit led to others. The colonel, who had been extremely reserved at first, ended by opening his heart, and the cur√© and the warden finally came to know the whole history, and how Pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his child‚Äôs future. This caused the cur√© to regard him with veneration and tenderness, and the colonel, on his side, became fond of the cur√©. And moreover, when both are sincere and good, no men so penetrate each other
U||, and so amalgamate with each other, as an old priest and an old soldier. At bottom, the man is the same. The one has devoted his life to his country here below, the other to his country on high; that is the only difference.
U||Twice a year, on the first of January and on St. George‚Äôs day, Marius wrote duty letters to his father, which were dictated by his aunt, and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula; this was all that M. Gillenormand tolerated; and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîREQUIESCANT
U||Madame de T.‚Äôs salon was all that Marius Pontmercy knew of the world. It was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life. This opening was sombre, and more cold than warmth, more night than day, came to him through this skylight. This child, who had been all joy and light on entering this strange world, soon became melancholy, and, what is still more contrary to his age, grave. Surrounded by all those singular and imposing personages, he gazed about him with serious amazement. Everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him. There were in Madame de T.‚Äôs salon some very noble ladies named Mathan, No√©, L√©vis,‚Äîwhich was pronounced L√©vi,‚ÄîCambis, pronounced Cambyse. These antique visages and these Biblical names mingled in the child‚Äôs mind with the Old Testament which he was learning by heart, and when they were all there, seated in a circle around a dying fire, sparely lighted by a lamp shaded with green, with their severe profiles, their gray or white hair, their long go
U||wns of another age, whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished, dropping, at rare intervals, words which were both majestic and severe, little Marius stared at them with frightened eyes, in the conviction that he beheld not women, but patriarchs and magi, not real beings, but phantoms.
U||With these phantoms, priests were sometimes mingled, frequenters of this ancient salon, and some gentlemen; the Marquis de Sass****, private secretary to Madame de Berry, the Vicomte de Val***, who published, under the pseudonym of Charles-Antoine, monorhymed odes, the Prince de Beauff*******, who, though very young, had a gray head and a pretty and witty wife, whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows, the Marquis de C***** d‚ÄôE******, the man in all France who best understood ‚Äúproportioned politeness,‚Äù the Comte d‚ÄôAm*****, the kindly man with the amiable chin, and the Ch√©valier de Port-de-Guy, a pillar of the library of the Louvre, called the King‚Äôs cabinet, M. de Port-de-Guy, bald, and rather aged than old, was wont to relate that in 1793, at the age of sixteen, he had been put in the galleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian, the Bishop of Mirepoix, also refractory, but as a priest, while he was so in the capacity of a soldier. This 
U||was at Toulon. Their business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day; they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses, and their red galley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck, which was dry in the morning and wet at night. These tragic tales abounded in Madame de T.‚Äôs salon, and by dint of cursing Marat, they applauded Trestaillon. Some deputies of the undiscoverable variety played their whist there; M. Thibord du Chalard, M. Lemarchant de Gomicourt, and the celebrated scoffer of the right, M. Cornet-Dincourt. The bailiff de Ferrette, with his short breeches and his thin legs, sometimes traversed this salon on his way to M. de Talleyrand. He had been M. le Comte d‚ÄôArtois‚Äô companion in pleasures and unlike Aristotle crouching under Campaspe, he had made the Guimard crawl on all fours, and in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by a bailiff. As for the priests, there w
U||as the Abb√© Halma, the same to whom M. Larose, his collaborator on la Foudre, said: ‚ÄúBah! Who is there who is not fifty years old? a few greenhorns perhaps?‚Äù The Abb√© Letourneur, preacher to the King, the Abb√© Frayssinous, who was not, as yet, either count, or bishop, or minister, or peer, and who wore an old cassock whose buttons were missing, and the Abb√© Keravenant, Cur√© of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s; also the Pope‚Äôs Nuncio, then Monsignor Macchi, Archbishop of Nisibi, later on Cardinal, remarkable for his long, pensive nose, and another Monsignor, entitled thus: Abbate Palmieri, domestic prelate, one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the Holy See, Canon of the illustrious Liberian basilica, Advocate of the saints, Postulatore dei Santi, which refers to matters of canonization, and signifies very nearly: Master of Requests of the section of Paradise. Lastly, two cardinals, M. de la Luzerne, and M. de Cl****** T*******. The Cardinal of Luzerne was a writer and was destined to have, a few y
U||ears later, the honor of signing in the Conservateur articles side by side with Chateaubriand; M. de Cl****** T******* was Archbishop of Toul****, and often made trips to Paris, to his nephew, the Marquis de T*******, who was Minister of Marine and War. The Cardinal of Cl****** T******* was a merry little man, who displayed his red stockings beneath his tucked-up cassock; his specialty was a hatred of the Encyclop√¶dia, and his desperate play at billiards, and persons who, at that epoch, passed through the Rue M***** on summer evenings, where the hotel de Cl****** T******* then stood, halted to listen to the shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the Cardinal shouting to his conclavist, Monseigneur Cotiret, Bishop in partibus of Caryste: ‚ÄúMark, Abb√©, I make a cannon.‚Äù The Cardinal de Cl****** T******* had been brought to Madame de T.‚Äôs by his most intimate friend, M. de Roquelaure, former Bishop of Senlis, and one of the Forty. M. de Roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity 
U||at the Academy; through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the French Academy then held its meetings, the curious could, on every Tuesday, contemplate the Ex-Bishop of Senlis, usually standing erect, freshly powdered, in violet hose, with his back turned to the door, apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar. All these ecclesiastics, though for the most part as much courtiers as churchmen, added to the gravity of the T. salon, whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five peers of France, the Marquis de Vib****, the Marquis de Tal***, the Marquis de Herb*******, the Vicomte Damb***, and the Duc de Val********. This Duc de Val********, although Prince de Mon***, that is to say a reigning prince abroad, had so high an idea of France and its peerage, that he viewed everything through their medium. It was he who said: ‚ÄúThe Cardinals are the peers of France of Rome; the lords are the peers of France of England.‚Äù Moreover, as it is indispensable that 
U||the Revolution should be everywhere in this century, this feudal salon was, as we have said, dominated by a bourgeois. M. Gillenormand reigned there.
U||There lay the essence and quintessence of the Parisian white society. There reputations, even Royalist reputations, were held in quarantine. There is always a trace of anarchy in renown. Chateaubriand, had he entered there, would have produced the effect of P√®re Duch√™ne. Some of the scoffed-at did, nevertheless, penetrate thither on sufferance. Comte Beug*** was received there, subject to correction.
U||The ‚Äúnoble‚Äù salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons. The Faubourg Saint-Germain reeks of the fagot even now. The Royalists of to-day are demagogues, let us record it to their credit.
U||At Madame de T.‚Äôs the society was superior, taste was exquisite and haughty, under the cover of a great show of politeness. Manners there admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old r√©gime itself, buried but still alive. Some of these habits, especially in the matter of language, seem eccentric. Persons but superficially acquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was only antique. A woman was called Madame la G√©n√©rale. Madame la Colonelle was not entirely disused. The charming Madame de L√©on, in memory, no doubt, of the Duchesses de Longueville and de Chevreuse, preferred this appellation to her title of Princesse. The Marquise de Cr√©quy was also called Madame la Colonelle.
U||It was this little high society which invented at the Tuileries the refinement of speaking to the King in private as the King, in the third person, and never as Your Majesty, the designation of Your Majesty having been ‚Äúsoiled by the usurper.‚Äù
U||Men and deeds were brought to judgment there. They jeered at the age, which released them from the necessity of understanding it. They abetted each other in amazement. They communicated to each other that modicum of light which they possessed. Methuselah bestowed information on Epimenides. The deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the course of things. They declared that the time which had elapsed since Coblentz had not existed. In the same manner that Louis XVIII. was by the grace of God, in the five and twentieth year of his reign, the emigrants were, by rights, in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence.
U||All was harmonious; nothing was too much alive; speech hardly amounted to a breath; the newspapers, agreeing with the salons, seemed a papyrus. There were some young people, but they were rather dead. The liveries in the antechamber were antiquated. These utterly obsolete personages were served by domestics of the same stamp.
U||They all had the air of having lived a long time ago, and of obstinately resisting the sepulchre. Nearly the whole dictionary consisted of Conserver, Conservation, Conservateur; to be in good odor,‚Äîthat was the point. There are, in fact, aromatics in the opinions of these venerable groups, and their ideas smelled of it. It was a mummified society. The masters were embalmed, the servants were stuffed with straw.
U||A worthy old marquise, an emigr√©e and ruined, who had but a solitary maid, continued to say: ‚ÄúMy people.‚Äù
U||What did they do in Madame de T.‚Äôs salon? They were ultra.
U||To be ultra; this word, although what it represents may not have disappeared, has no longer any meaning at the present day. Let us explain it.
U||To be ultra is to go beyond. It is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne, and the mitre in the name of the altar; it is to ill-treat the thing which one is dragging, it is to kick over the traces; it is to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics; it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry; it is to insult through excess of respect; it is to discover that the Pope is not sufficiently papish, that the King is not sufficiently royal, and that the night has too much light; it is to be discontented with alabaster, with snow, with the swan and the lily in the name of whiteness; it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy; it is to be so strongly for, as to be against.
U||The ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of the Restoration.
U||Nothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in 1814 and terminates about 1820, with the advent of M. de Vill√®le, the practical man of the Right. These six years were an extraordinary moment; at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy, smiling and sombre, illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered, at the same time, with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still filled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the past. There existed in that light and that shadow, a complete little new and old world, comic and sad, juvenile and senile, which was rubbing its eyes; nothing resembles an awakening like a return; a group which regarded France with ill-temper, and which France regarded with irony; good old owls of marquises by the streetful, who had returned, and of ghosts, the ‚Äúformer‚Äù subjects of amazement at everything, brave and noble gentlemen who smiled at being in France but wept also, delighted to behold their country once more, in despair at not finding
U|| their monarchy; the nobility of the Crusades treating the nobility of the Empire, that is to say, the nobility of the sword, with scorn; historic races who had lost the sense of history; the sons of the companions of Charlemagne disdaining the companions of Napoleon. The swords, as we have just remarked, returned the insult; the sword of Fontenoy was laughable and nothing but a scrap of rusty iron; the sword of Marengo was odious and was only a sabre. Former days did not recognize Yesterday. People no longer had the feeling for what was grand. There was some one who called Bonaparte Scapin. This Society no longer exists. Nothing of it, we repeat, exists to-day. When we select from it some one figure at random, and attempt to make it live again in thought, it seems as strange to us as the world before the Deluge. It is because it, too, as a matter of fact, has been engulfed in a deluge. It has disappeared beneath two Revolutions. What billows are ideas! How quickly they cover all that it is their mission to 
U||destroy and to bury, and how promptly they create frightful gulfs!
U||Such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid times when M. Martainville had more wit than Voltaire.
U||These salons had a literature and politics of their own. They believed in Fi√©v√©e. M. Agier laid down the law in them. They commentated M. Colnet, the old bookseller and publicist of the Quay Malaquais. Napoleon was to them thoroughly the Corsican Ogre. Later on the introduction into history of M. le Marquis de Bonaparte, Lieutenant-General of the King‚Äôs armies, was a concession to the spirit of the age.
U||These salons did not long preserve their purity. Beginning with 1818, doctrinarians began to spring up in them, a disturbing shade. Their way was to be Royalists and to excuse themselves for being so. Where the ultras were very proud, the doctrinarians were rather ashamed. They had wit; they had silence; their political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance; they should have succeeded. They indulged, and usefully too, in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned coats. The mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to create aged youth. They assumed the poses of wise men. They dreamed of engrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle. They opposed, and sometimes with rare intelligence, conservative liberalism to the liberalism which demolishes. They were heard to say: ‚ÄúThanks for Royalism! It has rendered more than one service. It has brought back tradition, worship, religion, respect. It is faithful, brave, chivalric, loving, devoted. It has m
U||ingled, though with regret, the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of the nation. Its mistake is not to understand the Revolution, the Empire, glory, liberty, young ideas, young generations, the age. But this mistake which it makes with regard to us,‚Äîhave we not sometimes been guilty of it towards them? The Revolution, whose heirs we are, ought to be intelligent on all points. To attack Royalism is a misconstruction of liberalism. What an error! And what blindness! Revolutionary France is wanting in respect towards historic France, that is to say, towards its mother, that is to say, towards itself. After the 5th of September, the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the Empire was treated after the 5th of July. They were unjust to the eagle, we are unjust to the fleur-de-lys. It seems that we must always have something to proscribe! Does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of Louis XIV., to scrape the coat of arms of Henry IV.? We scoff at M. de Vaublanc for era
U||sing the N‚Äôs from the bridge of Jena! What was it that he did? What are we doing? Bouvines belongs to us as well as Marengo. The fleurs-de-lys are ours as well as the N‚Äôs. That is our patrimony. To what purpose shall we diminish it? We must not deny our country in the past any more than in the present. Why not accept the whole of history? Why not love the whole of France?‚Äù
U||It is thus that doctrinarians criticised and protected Royalism, which was displeased at criticism and furious at protection.
U||The ultras marked the first epoch of Royalism, congregation characterized the second. Skill follows ardor. Let us confine ourselves here to this sketch.
U||In the course of this narrative, the author of this book has encountered in his path this curious moment of contemporary history; he has been forced to cast a passing glance upon it, and to trace once more some of the singular features of this society which is unknown to-day. But he does it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea. Souvenirs both respectful and affectionate, for they touch his mother, attach him to this past. Moreover, let us remark, this same petty world had a grandeur of its own. One may smile at it, but one can neither despise nor hate it. It was the France of former days.
U||Marius Pontmercy pursued some studies, as all children do. When he emerged from the hands of Aunt Gillenormand, his grandfather confided him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence. This young soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant.
U||Marius went through his years of college, then he entered the law school. He was a Royalist, fanatical and severe. He did not love his grandfather much, as the latter‚Äôs gayety and cynicism repelled him, and his feelings towards his father were gloomy.
U||He was, on the whole, a cold and ardent, noble, generous, proud, religious, enthusiastic lad; dignified to harshness, pure to shyness.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîEND OF THE BRIGAND
U||The conclusion of Marius‚Äô classical studies coincided with M. Gillenormand‚Äôs departure from society. The old man bade farewell to the Faubourg Saint-Germain and to Madame de T.‚Äôs salon, and established himself in the Marais, in his house of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. There he had for servants, in addition to the porter, that chambermaid, Nicolette, who had succeeded to Magnon, and that short-breathed and pursy Basque, who have been mentioned above.
U||In 1827, Marius had just attained his seventeenth year. One evening, on his return home, he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand.
U||‚ÄúMarius,‚Äù said M. Gillenormand, ‚Äúyou will set out for Vernon to-morrow.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù said Marius.
U||‚ÄúTo see your father.‚Äù
U||Marius was seized with a trembling fit. He had thought of everything except this‚Äîthat he should one day be called upon to see his father. Nothing could be more unexpected, more surprising, and, let us admit it, more disagreeable to him. It was forcing estrangement into reconciliation. It was not an affliction, but it was an unpleasant duty.
U||Marius, in addition to his motives of political antipathy, was convinced that his father, the slasher, as M. Gillenormand called him on his amiable days, did not love him; this was evident, since he had abandoned him to others. Feeling that he was not beloved, he did not love. ‚ÄúNothing is more simple,‚Äù he said to himself.
U||He was so astounded that he did not question M. Gillenormand. The grandfather resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt appears that he is ill. He demands your presence.‚Äù
U||And after a pause, he added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSet out to-morrow morning. I think there is a coach which leaves the Cour des Fontaines at six o‚Äôclock, and which arrives in the evening. Take it. He says that here is haste.‚Äù
U||Then he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket. Marius might have set out that very evening and have been with his father on the following morning. A diligence from the Rue du Bouloi took the trip to Rouen by night at that date, and passed through Vernon. Neither Marius nor M. Gillenormand thought of making inquiries about it.
U||The next day, at twilight, Marius reached Vernon. People were just beginning to light their candles. He asked the first person whom he met for ‚ÄúM. Pontmercy‚Äôs house.‚Äù For in his own mind, he agreed with the Restoration, and like it, did not recognize his father‚Äôs claim to the title of either colonel or baron.
U||The house was pointed out to him. He rang; a woman with a little lamp in her hand opened the door.
U||‚ÄúM. Pontmercy?‚Äù said Marius.
U||The woman remained motionless.
U||‚ÄúIs this his house?‚Äù demanded Marius.
U||The woman nodded affirmatively.
U||‚ÄúCan I speak with him?‚Äù
U||The woman shook her head.
U||‚ÄúBut I am his son!‚Äù persisted Marius. ‚ÄúHe is expecting me.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe no longer expects you,‚Äù said the woman.
U||Then he perceived that she was weeping.
U||She pointed to the door of a room on the ground floor; he entered.
U||In that room, which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on the chimney-piece, there were three men, one standing erect, another kneeling, and one lying at full length, on the floor in his shirt. The one on the floor was the colonel.
U||The other two were the doctor, and the priest, who was engaged in prayer.
U||The colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously. As he had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness, he had written to M. Gillenormand to demand his son. The malady had grown worse. On the very evening of Marius‚Äô arrival at Vernon, the colonel had had an attack of delirium; he had risen from his bed, in spite of the servant‚Äôs efforts to prevent him, crying: ‚ÄúMy son is not coming! I shall go to meet him!‚Äù Then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate on the floor of the antechamber. He had just expired.
U||The doctor had been summoned, and the cur√©. The doctor had arrived too late. The son had also arrived too late.
U||By the dim light of the candle, a large tear could be distinguished on the pale and prostrate colonel‚Äôs cheek, where it had trickled from his dead eye. The eye was extinguished, but the tear was not yet dry. That tear was his son‚Äôs delay.
U||Marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time, on that venerable and manly face, on those open eyes which saw not, on those white locks, those robust limbs, on which, here and there, brown lines, marking sword-thrusts, and a sort of red stars, which indicated bullet-holes, were visible. He contemplated that gigantic sear which stamped heroism on that countenance upon which God had imprinted goodness. He reflected that this man was his father, and that this man was dead, and a chill ran over him.
U||The sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in the presence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold stretched out in death.
U||Anguish, poignant anguish, was in that chamber. The servant-woman was lamenting in a corner, the cur√© was praying, and his sobs were audible, the doctor was wiping his eyes; the corpse itself was weeping.
U||The doctor, the priest, and the woman gazed at Marius in the midst of their affliction without uttering a word; he was the stranger there. Marius, who was far too little affected, felt ashamed and embarrassed at his own attitude; he held his hat in his hand; and he dropped it on the floor, in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived him of the strength to hold it.
U||At the same time, he experienced remorse, and he despised himself for behaving in this manner. But was it his fault? He did not love his father? Why should he!
U||The colonel had left nothing. The sale of big furniture barely paid the expenses of his burial.
U||The servant found a scrap of paper, which she handed to Marius. It contained the following, in the colonel‚Äôs handwriting:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFor my son.‚ÄîThe Emperor made me a Baron on the battle-field of Waterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which I purchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it. That he will be worthy of it is a matter of course.‚Äù Below, the colonel had added: ‚ÄúAt that same battle of Waterloo, a sergeant saved my life. The man‚Äôs name was Th√©nardier. I think that he has recently been keeping a little inn, in a village in the neighborhood of Paris, at Chelles or Montfermeil. If my son meets him, he will do all the good he can to Th√©nardier.‚Äù
U||Marius took this paper and preserved it, not out of duty to his father, but because of that vague respect for death which is always imperious in the heart of man.
U||Nothing remained of the colonel. M. Gillenormand had his sword and uniform sold to an old-clothes dealer. The neighbors devastated the garden and pillaged the rare flowers. The other plants turned to nettles and weeds, and died.
U||Marius remained only forty-eight hours at Vernon. After the interment he returned to Paris, and applied himself again to his law studies, with no more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived. In two days the colonel was buried, and in three forgotten.
U||Marius wore crape on his hat. That was all.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîTHE UTILITY OF GOING TO MASS, IN ORDER TO BECOME A REVOLUTIONIST
U||Marius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood. One Sunday, when he went to hear mass at Saint-Sulpice, at that same chapel of the Virgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad, he placed himself behind a pillar, being more absent-minded and thoughtful than usual on that occasion, and knelt down, without paying any special heed, upon a chair of Utrecht velvet, on the back of which was inscribed this name: Monsieur Mabeuf, warden. Mass had hardly begun when an old man presented himself and said to Marius:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThis is my place, sir.‚Äù
U||Marius stepped aside promptly, and the old man took possession of his chair.
U||The mass concluded, Marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces distant; the old man approached him again and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI beg your pardon, sir, for having disturbed you a while ago, and for again disturbing you at this moment; you must have thought me intrusive, and I will explain myself.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThere is no need of that, Sir,‚Äù said Marius.
U||‚ÄúYes!‚Äù went on the old man, ‚ÄúI do not wish you to have a bad opinion of me. You see, I am attached to this place. It seems to me that the mass is better from here. Why? I will tell you. It is from this place, that I have watched a poor, brave father come regularly, every two or three months, for the last ten years, since he had no other opportunity and no other way of seeing his child, because he was prevented by family arrangements. He came at the hour when he knew that his son would be brought to mass. The little one never suspected that his father was there. Perhaps he did not even know that he had a father, poor innocent! The father kept behind a pillar, so that he might not be seen. He gazed at his child and he wept. He adored that little fellow, poor man! I could see that. This spot has become sanctified in my sight, and I have contracted a habit of coming hither to listen to the mass. I prefer it to the stall to which I have a right, in my capacity of warden. I knew that unhappy gentleman a litt
U||le, too. He had a father-in-law, a wealthy aunt, relatives, I don‚Äôt know exactly what all, who threatened to disinherit the child if he, the father, saw him. He sacrificed himself in order that his son might be rich and happy some day. He was separated from him because of political opinions. Certainly, I approve of political opinions, but there are people who do not know where to stop. Mon Dieu! a man is not a monster because he was at Waterloo; a father is not separated from his child for such a reason as that. He was one of Bonaparte‚Äôs colonels. He is dead, I believe. He lived at Vernon, where I have a brother who is a cur√©, and his name was something like Pontmarie or Montpercy. He had a fine sword-cut, on my honor.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPontmercy,‚Äù suggested Marius, turning pale.
U||‚ÄúPrecisely, Pontmercy. Did you know him?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSir,‚Äù said Marius, ‚Äúhe was my father.‚Äù
U||The old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAh! you are the child! Yes, that‚Äôs true, he must be a man by this time. Well! poor child, you may say that you had a father who loved you dearly!‚Äù
U||Marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his lodgings.
U||On the following day, he said to M. Gillenormand:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI have arranged a hunting-party with some friends. Will you permit me to be absent for three days?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFour!‚Äù replied his grandfather. ‚ÄúGo and amuse yourself.‚Äù
U||And he said to his daughter in a low tone, and with a wink, ‚ÄúSome love affair!‚Äù
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîTHE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING MET A WARDEN
U||Where it was that Marius went will be disclosed a little further on.
U||Marius was absent for three days, then he returned to Paris, went straight to the library of the law-school and asked for the files of the Moniteur.
U||He read the Moniteur, he read all the histories of the Republic and the Empire, the Memorial de Sainte-H√©l√®ne, all the memoirs, all the newspapers, the bulletins, the proclamations; he devoured everything. The first time that he came across his father‚Äôs name in the bulletins of the grand army, he had a fever for a week. He went to see the generals under whom Georges Pontmercy had served, among others, Comte H. Church-warden Mabeuf, whom he went to see again, told him about the life at Vernon, the colonel‚Äôs retreat, his flowers, his solitude. Marius came to a full knowledge of that rare, sweet, and sublime man, that species of lion-lamb who had been his father.
U||In the meanwhile, occupied as he was with this study which absorbed all his moments as well as his thoughts, he hardly saw the Gillenormands at all. He made his appearance at meals; then they searched for him, and he was not to be found. Father Gillenormand smiled. ‚ÄúBah! bah! He is just of the age for the girls!‚Äù Sometimes the old man added: ‚ÄúThe deuce! I thought it was only an affair of gallantry. It seems that it is an affair of passion!‚Äù
U||It was a passion, in fact. Marius was on the high road to adoring his father.
U||At the same time, his ideas underwent an extraordinary change. The phases of this change were numerous and successive. As this is the history of many minds of our day, we think it will prove useful to follow these phases step by step and to indicate them all.
U||That history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him.
U||The first effect was to dazzle him.
U||Up to that time, the Republic, the Empire, had been to him only monstrous words. The Republic, a guillotine in the twilight; the Empire, a sword in the night. He had just taken a look at it, and where he had expected to find only a chaos of shadows, he had beheld, with a sort of unprecedented surprise, mingled with fear and joy, stars sparkling, Mirabeau, Vergniaud, Saint-Just, Robespierre, Camille, Desmoulins, Danton, and a sun arise, Napoleon. He did not know where he stood. He recoiled, blinded by the brilliant lights. Little by little, when his astonishment had passed off, he grew accustomed to this radiance, he contemplated these deeds without dizziness, he examined these personages without terror; the Revolution and the Empire presented themselves luminously, in perspective, before his mind‚Äôs eye; he beheld each of these groups of events and of men summed up in two tremendous facts: the Republic in the sovereignty of civil right restored to the masses, the Empire in the sovereignty of the French idea
U|| imposed on Europe; he beheld the grand figure of the people emerge from the Revolution, and the grand figure of France spring forth from the Empire. He asserted in his conscience, that all this had been good. What his dazzled state neglected in this, his first far too synthetic estimation, we do not think it necessary to point out here. It is the state of a mind on the march that we are recording. Progress is not accomplished in one stage. That stated, once for all, in connection with what precedes as well as with what is to follow, we continue.
U||He then perceived that, up to that moment, he had comprehended his country no more than he had comprehended his father. He had not known either the one or the other, and a sort of voluntary night had obscured his eyes. Now he saw, and on the one hand he admired, while on the other he adored.
U||He was filled with regret and remorse, and he reflected in despair that all he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb. Oh! if his father had still been in existence, if he had still had him, if God, in his compassion and his goodness, had permitted his father to be still among the living, how he would have run, how he would have precipitated himself, how he would have cried to his father: ‚ÄúFather! Here I am! It is I! I have the same heart as thou! I am thy son!‚Äù How he would have embraced that white head, bathed his hair in tears, gazed upon his scar, pressed his hands, adored his garment, kissed his feet! Oh! Why had his father died so early, before his time, before the justice, the love of his son had come to him? Marius had a continual sob in his heart, which said to him every moment: ‚ÄúAlas!‚Äù At the same time, he became more truly serious, more truly grave, more sure of his thought and his faith. At each instant, gleams of the true came to complete his reason. An inward growth seemed t
U||o be in progress within him. He was conscious of a sort of natural enlargement, which gave him two things that were new to him‚Äîhis father and his country.
U||As everything opens when one has a key, so he explained to himself that which he had hated, he penetrated that which he had abhorred; henceforth he plainly perceived the providential, divine and human sense of the great things which he had been taught to detest, and of the great men whom he had been instructed to curse. When he reflected on his former opinions, which were but those of yesterday, and which, nevertheless, seemed to him already so very ancient, he grew indignant, yet he smiled.
U||From the rehabilitation of his father, he naturally passed to the rehabilitation of Napoleon.
U||But the latter, we will confess, was not effected without labor.
U||From his infancy, he had been imbued with the judgments of the party of 1814, on Bonaparte. Now, all the prejudices of the Restoration, all its interests, all its instincts tended to disfigure Napoleon. It execrated him even more than it did Robespierre. It had very cleverly turned to sufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation, and the hatred of mothers. Bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster, and in order to paint him to the imagination of the people, which, as we lately pointed out, resembles the imagination of children, the party of 1814 made him appear under all sorts of terrifying masks in succession, from that which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that which is terrible and becomes grotesque, from Tiberius to the bugaboo. Thus, in speaking of Bonaparte, one was free to sob or to puff up with laughter, provided that hatred lay at the bottom. Marius had never entertained‚Äîabout that man, as he was called‚Äîany other ideas in his mind. They had combined with the tenacity whic
U||h existed in his nature. There was in him a headstrong little man who hated Napoleon.
U||On reading history, on studying him, especially in the documents and materials for history, the veil which concealed Napoleon from the eyes of Marius was gradually rent. He caught a glimpse of something immense, and he suspected that he had been deceived up to that moment, on the score of Bonaparte as about all the rest; each day he saw more distinctly; and he set about mounting, slowly, step by step, almost regretfully in the beginning, then with intoxication and as though attracted by an irresistible fascination, first the sombre steps, then the vaguely illuminated steps, at last the luminous and splendid steps of enthusiasm.
U||One night, he was alone in his little chamber near the roof. His candle was burning; he was reading, with his elbows resting on his table close to the open window. All sorts of reveries reached him from space, and mingled with his thoughts. What a spectacle is the night! One hears dull sounds, without knowing whence they proceed; one beholds Jupiter, which is twelve hundred times larger than the earth, glowing like a firebrand, the azure is black, the stars shine; it is formidable.
U||He was perusing the bulletins of the grand army, those heroic strophes penned on the field of battle; there, at intervals, he beheld his father‚Äôs name, always the name of the Emperor; the whole of that great Empire presented itself to him; he felt a flood swelling and rising within him; it seemed to him at moments that his father passed close to him like a breath, and whispered in his ear; he gradually got into a singular state; he thought that he heard drums, cannon, trumpets, the measured tread of battalions, the dull and distant gallop of the cavalry; from time to time, his eyes were raised heavenward, and gazed upon the colossal constellations as they gleamed in the measureless depths of space, then they fell upon his book once more, and there they beheld other colossal things moving confusedly. His heart contracted within him. He was in a transport, trembling, panting. All at once, without himself knowing what was in him, and what impulse he was obeying, he sprang to his feet, stretched both arms out 
U||of the window, gazed intently into the gloom, the silence, the infinite darkness, the eternal immensity, and exclaimed: ‚ÄúLong live the Emperor!‚Äù
U||From that moment forth, all was over; the Ogre of Corsica,‚Äîthe usurper,‚Äîthe tyrant,‚Äîthe monster who was the lover of his own sisters,‚Äîthe actor who took lessons of Talma,‚Äîthe poisoner of Jaffa,‚Äîthe tiger,‚ÄîBuonaparte,‚Äîall this vanished, and gave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone, at an inaccessible height, the pale marble phantom of C√¶sar. The Emperor had been for his father only the well-beloved captain whom one admires, for whom one sacrifices one‚Äôs self; he was something more to Marius. He was the predestined constructor of the French group, succeeding the Roman group in the domination of the universe. He was a prodigious architect, of a destruction, the continuer of Charlemagne, of Louis XI., of Henry IV., of Richelieu, of Louis XIV., and of the Committee of Public Safety, having his spots, no doubt, his faults, his crimes even, being a man, that is to say; but august in his faults, brilliant in his spots, powerful in his crime.
U||He was the predestined man, who had forced all nations to say: ‚ÄúThe great nation!‚Äù He was better than that, he was the very incarnation of France, conquering Europe by the sword which he grasped, and the world by the light which he shed. Marius saw in Bonaparte the dazzling spectre which will always rise upon the frontier, and which will guard the future. Despot but dictator; a despot resulting from a republic and summing up a revolution. Napoleon became for him the man-people as Jesus Christ is the man-God.
U||It will be perceived, that like all new converts to a religion, his conversion intoxicated him, he hurled himself headlong into adhesion and he went too far. His nature was so constructed; once on the downward slope, it was almost impossible for him to put on the drag. Fanaticism for the sword took possession of him, and complicated in his mind his enthusiasm for the idea. He did not perceive that, along with genius, and pell-mell, he was admitting force, that is to say, that he was installing in two compartments of his idolatry, on the one hand that which is divine, on the other that which is brutal. In many respects, he had set about deceiving himself otherwise. He admitted everything. There is a way of encountering error while on one‚Äôs way to the truth. He had a violent sort of good faith which took everything in the lump. In the new path which he had entered on, in judging the mistakes of the old regime, as in measuring the glory of Napoleon, he neglected the attenuating circumstances.
U||At all events, a tremendous step had been taken. Where he had formerly beheld the fall of the monarchy, he now saw the advent of France. His orientation had changed. What had been his East became the West. He had turned squarely round.
U||All these revolutions were accomplished within him, without his family obtaining an inkling of the case.
U||When, during this mysterious labor, he had entirely shed his old Bourbon and ultra skin, when he had cast off the aristocrat, the Jacobite and the Royalist, when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist, profoundly democratic and republican, he went to an engraver on the Quai des Orf√©vres and ordered a hundred cards bearing this name: Le Baron Marius Pontmercy.
U||This was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which had taken place in him, a change in which everything gravitated round his father.
U||Only, as he did not know any one and could not sow his cards with any porter, he put them in his pocket.
U||By another natural consequence, in proportion as he drew nearer to his father, to the latter‚Äôs memory, and to the things for which the colonel had fought five and twenty years before, he receded from his grandfather. We have long ago said, that M. Gillenormand‚Äôs temper did not please him. There already existed between them all the dissonances of the grave young man and the frivolous old man. The gayety of G√©ronte shocks and exasperates the melancholy of Werther. So long as the same political opinions and the same ideas had been common to them both, Marius had met M. Gillenormand there as on a bridge. When the bridge fell, an abyss was formed. And then, over and above all, Marius experienced unutterable impulses to revolt, when he reflected that it was M. Gillenormand who had, from stupid motives, torn him ruthlessly from the colonel, thus depriving the father of the child, and the child of the father.
U||By dint of pity for his father, Marius had nearly arrived at aversion for his grandfather.
U||Nothing of this sort, however, was betrayed on the exterior, as we have already said. Only he grew colder and colder; laconic at meals, and rare in the house. When his aunt scolded him for it, he was very gentle and alleged his studies, his lectures, the examinations, etc., as a pretext. His grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis: ‚ÄúIn love! I know all about it.‚Äù
U||From time to time Marius absented himself.
U||‚ÄúWhere is it that he goes off like this?‚Äù said his aunt.
U||On one of these trips, which were always very brief, he went to Montfermeil, in order to obey the injunction which his father had left him, and he sought the old sergeant to Waterloo, the inn-keeper Th√©nardier. Th√©nardier had failed, the inn was closed, and no one knew what had become of him. Marius was away from the house for four days on this quest.
U||‚ÄúHe is getting decidedly wild,‚Äù said his grandfather.
U||They thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast, under his shirt, which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon.
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîSOME PETTICOAT
U||We have mentioned a lancer.
U||He was a great-grand-nephew of M. Gillenormand, on the paternal side, who led a garrison life, outside the family and far from the domestic hearth. Lieutenant Th√©odule Gillenormand fulfilled all the conditions required to make what is called a fine officer. He had ‚Äúa lady‚Äôs waist,‚Äù a victorious manner of trailing his sword and of twirling his moustache in a hook. He visited Paris very rarely, and so rarely that Marius had never seen him. The cousins knew each other only by name. We think we have said that Th√©odule was the favorite of Aunt Gillenormand, who preferred him because she did not see him. Not seeing people permits one to attribute to them all possible perfections.
U||One morning, Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder returned to her apartment as much disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing. Marius had just asked his grandfather‚Äôs permission to take a little trip, adding that he meant to set out that very evening. ‚ÄúGo!‚Äù had been his grandfather‚Äôs reply, and M. Gillenormand had added in an aside, as he raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead: ‚ÄúHere he is passing the night out again.‚Äù Mademoiselle Gillenormand had ascended to her chamber greatly puzzled, and on the staircase had dropped this exclamation: ‚ÄúThis is too much!‚Äù‚Äîand this interrogation: ‚ÄúBut where is it that he goes?‚Äù She espied some adventure of the heart, more or less illicit, a woman in the shadow, a rendezvous, a mystery, and she would not have been sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair. Tasting a mystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal; sainted souls do not detest this. There is some curiosity about scandal in the secret compartments of bigotry.
U||So she was the prey of a vague appetite for learning a history.
U||In order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little beyond her wont, she took refuge in her talents, and set about scalloping, with one layer of cotton after another, one of those embroideries of the Empire and the Restoration, in which there are numerous cart-wheels. The work was clumsy, the worker cross. She had been seated at this for several hours when the door opened. Mademoiselle Gillenormand raised her nose. Lieutenant Th√©odule stood before her, making the regulation salute. She uttered a cry of delight. One may be old, one may be a prude, one may be pious, one may be an aunt, but it is always agreeable to see a lancer enter one‚Äôs chamber.
U||‚ÄúYou here, Th√©odule!‚Äù she exclaimed.
U||‚ÄúOn my way through town, aunt.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúEmbrace me.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHere goes!‚Äù said Th√©odule.
U||And he kissed her. Aunt Gillenormand went to her writing-desk and opened it.
U||‚ÄúYou will remain with us a week at least?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI leave this very evening, aunt.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt is not possible!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMathematically!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúRemain, my little Th√©odule, I beseech you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMy heart says ‚Äòyes,‚Äô but my orders say ‚Äòno.‚Äô The matter is simple. They are changing our garrison; we have been at Melun, we are being transferred to Gaillon. It is necessary to pass through Paris in order to get from the old post to the new one. I said: ‚ÄòI am going to see my aunt.‚Äô‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHere is something for your trouble.‚Äù
U||And she put ten louis into his hand.
U||‚ÄúFor my pleasure, you mean to say, my dear aunt.‚Äù
U||Th√©odule kissed her again, and she experienced the joy of having some of the skin scratched from her neck by the braidings on his uniform.
U||‚ÄúAre you making the journey on horseback, with your regiment?‚Äù she asked him.
U||‚ÄúNo, aunt. I wanted to see you. I have special permission. My servant is taking my horse; I am travelling by diligence. And, by the way, I want to ask you something.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIs my cousin Marius Pontmercy travelling so, too?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHow do you know that?‚Äù said his aunt, suddenly pricked to the quick with a lively curiosity.
U||‚ÄúOn my arrival, I went to the diligence to engage my seat in the coup√©.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial. I saw his name on the card.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat name?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMarius Pontmercy.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe wicked fellow!‚Äù exclaimed his aunt. ‚ÄúAh! your cousin is not a steady lad like yourself. To think that he is to pass the night in a diligence!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúJust as I am going to do.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut you‚Äîit is your duty; in his case, it is wildness.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBosh!‚Äù said Th√©odule.
U||Here an event occurred to Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder,‚Äîan idea struck her. If she had been a man, she would have slapped her brow. She apostrophized Th√©odule:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAre you aware whether your cousin knows you?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo. I have seen him; but he has never deigned to notice me.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSo you are going to travel together?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe in the imperial, I in the coup√©.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhere does this diligence run?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo Andelys.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThen that is where Marius is going?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúUnless, like myself, he should stop on the way. I get down at Vernon, in order to take the branch coach for Gaillon. I know nothing of Marius‚Äô plan of travel.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMarius! what an ugly name! what possessed them to name him Marius? While you, at least, are called Th√©odule.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI would rather be called Alfred,‚Äù said the officer.
U||‚ÄúListen, Th√©odule.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am listening, aunt.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPay attention.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am paying attention.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou understand?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell, Marius absents himself!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúEh! eh!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe travels.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh! ah!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe spends the night out.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOh! oh!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWe should like to know what there is behind all this.‚Äù
U||Th√©odule replied with the composure of a man of bronze:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSome petticoat or other.‚Äù
U||And with that inward laugh which denotes certainty, he added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúA lass.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is evident,‚Äù exclaimed his aunt, who thought she heard M. Gillenormand speaking, and who felt her conviction become irresistible at that word fillette, accentuated in almost the very same fashion by the granduncle and the grandnephew. She resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDo us a favor. Follow Marius a little. He does not know you, it will be easy. Since a lass there is, try to get a sight of her. You must write us the tale. It will amuse his grandfather.‚Äù
U||Th√©odule had no excessive taste for this sort of spying; but he was much touched by the ten louis, and he thought he saw a chance for a possible sequel. He accepted the commission and said: ‚ÄúAs you please, aunt.‚Äù
U||And he added in an aside, to himself: ‚ÄúHere I am a duenna.‚Äù
U||Mademoiselle Gillenormand embraced him.
U||‚ÄúYou are not the man to play such pranks, Th√©odule. You obey discipline, you are the slave of orders, you are a man of scruples and duty, and you would not quit your family to go and see a creature.‚Äù
U||The lancer made the pleased grimace of Cartouche when praised for his probity.
U||Marius, on the evening following this dialogue, mounted the diligence without suspecting that he was watched. As for the watcher, the first thing he did was to fall asleep. His slumber was complete and conscientious. Argus snored all night long.
U||At daybreak, the conductor of the diligence shouted: ‚ÄúVernon! relay of Vernon! Travellers for Vernon!‚Äù And Lieutenant Th√©odule woke.
U||‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he growled, still half asleep, ‚Äúthis is where I get out.‚Äù
U||Then, as his memory cleared by degrees, the effect of waking, he recalled his aunt, the ten louis, and the account which he had undertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of Marius. This set him to laughing.
U||‚ÄúPerhaps he is no longer in the coach,‚Äù he thought, as he rebuttoned the waistcoat of his undress uniform. ‚ÄúHe may have stopped at Poissy; he may have stopped at Triel; if he did not get out at Meulan, he may have got out at Mantes, unless he got out at Rolleboise, or if he did not go on as far as Pacy, with the choice of turning to the left at √âvreus, or to the right at Laroche-Guyon. Run after him, aunty. What the devil am I to write to that good old soul?‚Äù
U||At that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial, made its appearance at the window of the coup√©.
U||‚ÄúCan that be Marius?‚Äù said the lieutenant.
U||It was Marius.
U||A little peasant girl, all entangled with the horses and the postilions at the end of the vehicle, was offering flowers to the travellers. ‚ÄúGive your ladies flowers!‚Äù she cried.
U||Marius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flat basket.
U||‚ÄúCome now,‚Äù said Th√©odule, leaping down from the coup√©, ‚Äúthis piques my curiosity. Who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to? She must be a splendidly handsome woman for so fine a bouquet. I want to see her.‚Äù
U||And no longer in pursuance of orders, but from personal curiosity, like dogs who hunt on their own account, he set out to follow Marius.
U||Marius paid no attention to Th√©odule. Elegant women descended from the diligence; he did not glance at them. He seemed to see nothing around him.
U||‚ÄúHe is pretty deeply in love!‚Äù thought Th√©odule.
U||Marius directed his steps towards the church.
U||‚ÄúCapital,‚Äù said Th√©odule to himself. ‚ÄúRendezvous seasoned with a bit of mass are the best sort. Nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passes over the good God‚Äôs head.‚Äù
U||On arriving at the church, Marius did not enter it, but skirted the apse. He disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse.
U||‚ÄúThe rendezvous is appointed outside,‚Äù said Th√©odule. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a look at the lass.‚Äù
U||And he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner which Marius had turned.
U||On arriving there, he halted in amazement.
U||Marius, with his forehead clasped in his hands, was kneeling upon the grass on a grave. He had strewn his bouquet there. At the extremity of the grave, on a little swelling which marked the head, there stood a cross of black wood with this name in white letters: COLONEL BARON PONTMERCY. Marius‚Äô sobs were audible.
U||The ‚Äúlass‚Äù was a grave.
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîMARBLE AGAINST GRANITE
U||It was hither that Marius had come on the first occasion of his absenting himself from Paris. It was hither that he had come every time that M. Gillenormand had said: ‚ÄúHe is sleeping out.‚Äù
U||Lieutenant Th√©odule was absolutely put out of countenance by this unexpected encounter with a sepulchre; he experienced a singular and disagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing, and which was composed of respect for the tomb, mingled with respect for the colonel. He retreated, leaving Marius alone in the cemetery, and there was discipline in this retreat. Death appeared to him with large epaulets, and he almost made the military salute to him. Not knowing what to write to his aunt, he decided not to write at all; and it is probable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made by Th√©odule as to the love affairs of Marius, if, by one of those mysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance, the scene at Vernon had not had an almost immediate counter-shock at Paris.
U||Marius returned from Vernon on the third day, in the middle of the morning, descended at his grandfather‚Äôs door, and, wearied by the two nights spent in the diligence, and feeling the need of repairing his loss of sleep by an hour at the swimming-school, he mounted rapidly to his chamber, took merely time enough to throw off his travelling-coat, and the black ribbon which he wore round his neck, and went off to the bath.
U||M. Gillenormand, who had risen betimes like all old men in good health, had heard his entrance, and had made haste to climb, as quickly as his old legs permitted, the stairs to the upper story where Marius lived, in order to embrace him, and to question him while so doing, and to find out where he had been.
U||But the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to ascend, and when Father Gillenormand entered the attic, Marius was no longer there.
U||The bed had not been disturbed, and on the bed lay, outspread, but not defiantly the great-coat and the black ribbon.
U||‚ÄúI like this better,‚Äù said M. Gillenormand.
U||And a moment later, he made his entrance into the salon, where Mademoiselle Gillenormand was already seated, busily embroidering her cart-wheels.
U||The entrance was a triumphant one.
U||M. Gillenormand held in one hand the great-coat, and in the other the neck-ribbon, and exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúVictory! We are about to penetrate the mystery! We are going to learn the most minute details; we are going to lay our finger on the debaucheries of our sly friend! Here we have the romance itself. I have the portrait!‚Äù
U||In fact, a case of black shagreen, resembling a medallion portrait, was suspended from the ribbon.
U||The old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without opening it, with that air of enjoyment, rapture, and wrath, with which a poor hungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner which is not for him, pass under his very nose.
U||‚ÄúFor this evidently is a portrait. I know all about such things. That is worn tenderly on the heart. How stupid they are! Some abominable fright that will make us shudder, probably! Young men have such bad taste nowadays!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúLet us see, father,‚Äù said the old spinster.
U||The case opened by the pressure of a spring. They found in it nothing but a carefully folded paper.
U||‚ÄúFrom the same to the same,‚Äù said M. Gillenormand, bursting with laughter. ‚ÄúI know what it is. A billet-doux.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh! let us read it!‚Äù said the aunt.
U||And she put on her spectacles. They unfolded the paper and read as follows:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFor my son.‚ÄîThe Emperor made me a Baron on the battlefield of Waterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which I purchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it. That he will be worthy of it is a matter of course.‚Äù
U||The feelings of father and daughter cannot be described. They felt chilled as by the breath of a death‚Äôs-head. They did not exchange a word.
U||Only, M. Gillenormand said in a low voice and as though speaking to himself:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt is the slasher‚Äôs handwriting.‚Äù
U||The aunt examined the paper, turned it about in all directions, then put it back in its case.
U||At the same moment a little oblong packet, enveloped in blue paper, fell from one of the pockets of the great-coat. Mademoiselle Gillenormand picked it up and unfolded the blue paper.
U||It contained Marius‚Äô hundred cards. She handed one of them to M. Gillenormand, who read: Le Baron Marius Pontmercy.
U||The old man rang the bell. Nicolette came. M. Gillenormand took the ribbon, the case, and the coat, flung them all on the floor in the middle of the room, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCarry those duds away.‚Äù
U||A full hour passed in the most profound silence. The old man and the old spinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other, and were thinking, each on his own account, the same things, in all probability.
U||At the expiration of this hour, Aunt Gillenormand said:‚Äî‚ÄúA pretty state of things!‚Äù
U||A few moments later, Marius made his appearance. He entered. Even before he had crossed the threshold, he saw his grandfather holding one of his own cards in his hand, and on catching sight of him, the latter exclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was something crushing:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWell! well! well! well! well! so you are a baron now. I present you my compliments. What is the meaning of this?‚Äù
U||Marius reddened slightly and replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt means that I am the son of my father.‚Äù
U||M. Gillenormand ceased to laugh, and said harshly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am your father.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMy father,‚Äù retorted Marius, with downcast eyes and a severe air, ‚Äúwas a humble and heroic man, who served the Republic and France gloriously, who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made, who lived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century, beneath grape-shot and bullets, in snow and mud by day, beneath rain at night, who captured two flags, who received twenty wounds, who died forgotten and abandoned, and who never committed but one mistake, which was to love too fondly two ingrates, his country and myself.‚Äù
U||This was more than M. Gillenormand could bear to hear. At the word republic, he rose, or, to speak more correctly, he sprang to his feet. Every word that Marius had just uttered produced on the visage of the old Royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing brand. From a dull hue he had turned red, from red, purple, and from purple, flame-colored.
U||‚ÄúMarius!‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúAbominable child! I do not know what your father was! I do not wish to know! I know nothing about that, and I do not know him! But what I do know is, that there never was anything but scoundrels among those men! They were all rascals, assassins, red-caps, thieves! I say all! I say all! I know not one! I say all! Do you hear me, Marius! See here, you are no more a baron than my slipper is! They were all bandits in the service of Robespierre! All who served B-u-o-napart√© were brigands! They were all traitors who betrayed, betrayed, betrayed their legitimate king! All cowards who fled before the Prussians and the English at Waterloo! That is what I do know! Whether Monsieur your father comes in that category, I do not know! I am sorry for it, so much the worse, your humble servant!‚Äù
U||In his turn, it was Marius who was the firebrand and M. Gillenormand who was the bellows. Marius quivered in every limb, he did not know what would happen next, his brain was on fire. He was the priest who beholds all his sacred wafers cast to the winds, the fakir who beholds a passer-by spit upon his idol. It could not be that such things had been uttered in his presence. What was he to do? His father had just been trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence, but by whom? By his grandfather. How was he to avenge the one without outraging the other? It was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was equally impossible for him to leave his father unavenged. On the one hand was a sacred grave, on the other hoary locks.
U||He stood there for several moments, staggering as though intoxicated, with all this whirlwind dashing through his head; then he raised his eyes, gazed fixedly at his grandfather, and cried in a voice of thunder:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDown with the Bourbons, and that great hog of a Louis XVIII.!‚Äù
U||Louis XVIII. had been dead for four years; but it was all the same to him.
U||The old man, who had been crimson, turned whiter than his hair. He wheeled round towards a bust of M. le Duc de Berry, which stood on the chimney-piece, and made a profound bow, with a sort of peculiar majesty. Then he paced twice, slowly and in silence, from the fireplace to the window and from the window to the fireplace, traversing the whole length of the room, and making the polished floor creak as though he had been a stone statue walking.
U||On his second turn, he bent over his daughter, who was watching this encounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb, and said to her with a smile that was almost calm: ‚ÄúA baron like this gentleman, and a bourgeois like myself cannot remain under the same roof.‚Äù
U||And drawing himself up, all at once, pallid, trembling, terrible, with his brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath, he extended his arm towards Marius and shouted to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBe off!‚Äù
U||Marius left the house.
U||On the following day, M. Gillenormand said to his daughter:
U||‚ÄúYou will send sixty pistoles every six months to that blood-drinker, and you will never mention his name to me.‚Äù
U||Having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of, and not knowing what to do with it, he continued to address his daughter as you instead of thou for the next three months.
U||Marius, on his side, had gone forth in indignation. There was one circumstance which, it must be admitted, aggravated his exasperation. There are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic dramas. They augment the grievances in such cases, although, in reality, the wrongs are not increased by them. While carrying Marius‚Äô ‚Äúduds‚Äù precipitately to his chamber, at his grandfather‚Äôs command, Nicolette had, inadvertently, let fall, probably, on the attic staircase, which was dark, that medallion of black shagreen which contained the paper penned by the colonel. Neither paper nor case could afterwards be found. Marius was convinced that ‚ÄúMonsieur Gillenormand‚Äù‚Äîfrom that day forth he never alluded to him otherwise‚Äîhad flung ‚Äúhis father‚Äôs testament‚Äù in the fire. He knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written, and, consequently, nothing was lost. But the paper, the writing, that sacred relic,‚Äîall that was his very heart. What had been done with it?
U||Marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going, and without knowing where, with thirty francs, his watch, and a few clothes in a hand-bag. He had entered a hackney-coach, had engaged it by the hour, and had directed his course at hap-hazard towards the Latin quarter.
U||What was to become of Marius?
U||BOOK FOURTH‚ÄîTHE FRIENDS OF THE A B C
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîA GROUP WHICH BARELY MISSED BECOMING HISTORIC
U||At that epoch, which was, to all appearances indifferent, a certain revolutionary quiver was vaguely current. Breaths which had started forth from the depths of ‚Äô89 and ‚Äô93 were in the air. Youth was on the point, may the reader pardon us the word, of moulting. People were undergoing a transformation, almost without being conscious of it, through the movement of the age. The needle which moves round the compass also moves in souls. Each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound to take. The Royalists were becoming liberals, liberals were turning democrats. It was a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb movements; the peculiarity of ebbs is to create intermixtures; hence the combination of very singular ideas; people adored both Napoleon and liberty. We are making history here. These were the mirages of that period. Opinions traverse phases. Voltairian royalism, a quaint variety, had a no less singular sequel, Bonapartist liberalism.
U||Other groups of minds were more serious. In that direction, they sounded principles, they attached themselves to the right. They grew enthusiastic for the absolute, they caught glimpses of infinite realizations; the absolute, by its very rigidity, urges spirits towards the sky and causes them to float in illimitable space. There is nothing like dogma for bringing forth dreams. And there is nothing like dreams for engendering the future. Utopia to-day, flesh and blood to-morrow.
U||These advanced opinions had a double foundation. A beginning of mystery menaced ‚Äúthe established order of things,‚Äù which was suspicious and underhand. A sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree. The second thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in the mine. The incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the premeditation of coups d‚Äô√©tat.
U||There did not, as yet, exist in France any of those vast underlying organizations, like the German tugendbund and Italian Carbonarism; but here and there there were dark underminings, which were in process of throwing off shoots. The Cougourde was being outlined at Aix; there existed at Paris, among other affiliations of that nature, the society of the Friends of the A B C.
U||What were these Friends of the A B C? A society which had for its object apparently the education of children, in reality the elevation of man.
U||They declared themselves the Friends of the A B C,‚Äîthe Abaiss√©,‚Äîthe debased,‚Äîthat is to say, the people. They wished to elevate the people. It was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at. Puns are sometimes serious factors in politics; witness the Castratus ad castra, which made a general of the army of Narses; witness: Barbari et Barberini; witness: Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram, etc., etc.
U||The Friends of the A B C were not numerous, it was a secret society in the state of embryo, we might almost say a coterie, if coteries ended in heroes. They assembled in Paris in two localities, near the fish-market, in a wine-shop called Corinthe, of which more will be heard later on, and near the Pantheon in a little caf√© in the Rue Saint-Michel called the Caf√© Musain, now torn down; the first of these meeting-places was close to the workingman, the second to the students.
U||The assemblies of the Friends of the A B C were usually held in a back room of the Caf√© Musain.
U||This hall, which was tolerably remote from the caf√©, with which it was connected by an extremely long corridor, had two windows and an exit with a private stairway on the little Rue des Gr√®s. There they smoked and drank, and gambled and laughed. There they conversed in very loud tones about everything, and in whispers of other things. An old map of France under the Republic was nailed to the wall,‚Äîa sign quite sufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent.
U||The greater part of the Friends of the A B C were students, who were on cordial terms with the working classes. Here are the names of the principal ones. They belong, in a certain measure, to history: Enjolras, Combeferre, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly, Courfeyrac, Bahorel, Lesgle or Laigle, Joly, Grantaire.
U||These young men formed a sort of family, through the bond of friendship. All, with the exception of Laigle, were from the South.
U||Friends of the a B C
U||This was a remarkable group. It vanished in the invisible depths which lie behind us. At the point of this drama which we have now reached, it will not perhaps be superfluous to throw a ray of light upon these youthful heads, before the reader beholds them plunging into the shadow of a tragic adventure.
U||Enjolras, whose name we have mentioned first of all,‚Äîthe reader shall see why later on,‚Äîwas an only son and wealthy.
U||Enjolras was a charming young man, who was capable of being terrible. He was angelically handsome. He was a savage Antinous. One would have said, to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance, that he had already, in some previous state of existence, traversed the revolutionary apocalypse. He possessed the tradition of it as though he had been a witness. He was acquainted with all the minute details of the great affair. A pontifical and warlike nature, a singular thing in a youth. He was an officiating priest and a man of war; from the immediate point of view, a soldier of the democracy; above the contemporary movement, the priest of the ideal. His eyes were deep, his lids a little red, his lower lip was thick and easily became disdainful, his brow was lofty. A great deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon in a view. Like certain young men at the beginning of this century and the end of the last, who became illustrious at an early age, he was endowed with excessive youth, and was as rosy as 
U||a young girl, although subject to hours of pallor. Already a man, he still seemed a child. His two and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen; he was serious, it did not seem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman. He had but one passion‚Äîthe right; but one thought‚Äîto overthrow the obstacle. On Mount Aventine, he would have been Gracchus; in the Convention, he would have been Saint-Just. He hardly saw the roses, he ignored spring, he did not hear the carolling of the birds; the bare throat of Evadne would have moved him no more than it would have moved Aristogeiton; he, like Harmodius, thought flowers good for nothing except to conceal the sword. He was severe in his enjoyments. He chastely dropped his eyes before everything which was not the Republic. He was the marble lover of liberty. His speech was harshly inspired, and had the thrill of a hymn. He was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul. Woe to the love-affair which should have risked itself beside him! If any grisette
U|| of the Place Cambrai or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais, seeing that face of a youth escaped from college, that page‚Äôs mien, those long, golden lashes, those blue eyes, that hair billowing in the wind, those rosy cheeks, those fresh lips, those exquisite teeth, had conceived an appetite for that complete aurora, and had tried her beauty on Enjolras, an astounding and terrible glance would have promptly shown her the abyss, and would have taught her not to confound the mighty cherub of Ezekiel with the gallant Cherubino of Beaumarchais.
U||By the side of Enjolras, who represented the logic of the Revolution, Combeferre represented its philosophy. Between the logic of the Revolution and its philosophy there exists this difference‚Äîthat its logic may end in war, whereas its philosophy can end only in peace. Combeferre complemented and rectified Enjolras. He was less lofty, but broader. He desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles of general ideas: he said: ‚ÄúRevolution, but civilization‚Äù; and around the mountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky. The Revolution was more adapted for breathing with Combeferre than with Enjolras. Enjolras expressed its divine right, and Combeferre its natural right. The first attached himself to Robespierre; the second confined himself to Condorcet. Combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world more than did Enjolras. If it had been granted to these two young men to attain to history, the one would have been the just, the other the wise man. Enjolras was the more virile, Comb
U||eferre the more humane. Homo and vir, that was the exact effect of their different shades. Combeferre was as gentle as Enjolras was severe, through natural whiteness. He loved the word citizen, but he preferred the word man. He would gladly have said: Hombre, like the Spanish. He read everything, went to the theatres, attended the courses of public lecturers, learned the polarization of light from Arago, grew enthusiastic over a lesson in which Geoffroy Sainte-Hilaire explained the double function of the external carotid artery, and the internal, the one which makes the face, and the one which makes the brain; he kept up with what was going on, followed science step by step, compared Saint-Simon with Fourier, deciphered hieroglyphics, broke the pebble which he found and reasoned on geology, drew from memory a silkworm moth, pointed out the faulty French in the Dictionary of the Academy, studied Puys√©gur and Deleuze, affirmed nothing, not even miracles; denied nothing, not even ghosts; turned over the files 
U||of the Moniteur, reflected. He declared that the future lies in the hand of the schoolmaster, and busied himself with educational questions. He desired that society should labor without relaxation at the elevation of the moral and intellectual level, at coining science, at putting ideas into circulation, at increasing the mind in youthful persons, and he feared lest the present poverty of method, the paltriness from a literary point of view confined to two or three centuries called classic, the tyrannical dogmatism of official pedants, scholastic prejudices and routines should end by converting our colleges into artificial oyster beds. He was learned, a purist, exact, a graduate of the Polytechnic, a close student, and at the same time, thoughtful ‚Äúeven to chim√¶ras,‚Äù so his friends said. He believed in all dreams, railroads, the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations, the fixing of images in the dark chamber, the electric telegraph, the steering of balloons. Moreover, he was not much alarmed
U|| by the citadels erected against the human mind in every direction, by superstition, despotism, and prejudice. He was one of those who think that science will eventually turn the position. Enjolras was a chief, Combeferre was a guide. One would have liked to fight under the one and to march behind the other. It is not that Combeferre was not capable of fighting, he did not refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle, and to attack it by main force and explosively; but it suited him better to bring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually, by means of education, the inculcation of axioms, the promulgation of positive laws; and, between two lights, his preference was rather for illumination than for conflagration. A conflagration can create an aurora, no doubt, but why not await the dawn? A volcano illuminates, but daybreak furnishes a still better illumination. Possibly, Combeferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime. A light troubled by smoke, progress purchas
U||ed at the expense of violence, only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit. The headlong precipitation of a people into the truth, a ‚Äò93, terrified him; nevertheless, stagnation was still more repulsive to him, in it he detected putrefaction and death; on the whole, he preferred scum to miasma, and he preferred the torrent to the cesspool, and the falls of Niagara to the lake of Montfaucon. In short, he desired neither halt nor haste. While his tumultuous friends, captivated by the absolute, adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures, Combeferre was inclined to let progress, good progress, take its own course; he may have been cold, but he was pure; methodical, but irreproachable; phlegmatic, but imperturbable. Combeferre would have knelt and clasped his hands to enable the future to arrive in all its candor, and that nothing might disturb the immense and virtuous evolution of the races. The good must be innocent, he repeated incessantly. And in fact, if the grandeur of the Revolution cons
U||ists in keeping the dazzling ideal fixedly in view, and of soaring thither athwart the lightnings, with fire and blood in its talons, the beauty of progress lies in being spotless; and there exists between Washington, who represents the one, and Danton, who incarnates the other, that difference which separates the swan from the angel with the wings of an eagle.
U||Jean Prouvaire was a still softer shade than Combeferre. His name was Jehan, owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the powerful and profound movement whence sprang the very essential study of the Middle Ages. Jean Prouvaire was in love; he cultivated a pot of flowers, played on the flute, made verses, loved the people, pitied woman, wept over the child, confounded God and the future in the same confidence, and blamed the Revolution for having caused the fall of a royal head, that of Andr√© Ch√©nier. His voice was ordinarily delicate, but suddenly grew manly. He was learned even to erudition, and almost an Orientalist. Above all, he was good; and, a very simple thing to those who know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur, in the matter of poetry, he preferred the immense. He knew Italian, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; and these served him only for the perusal of four poets: Dante, Juvenal, √Üschylus, and Isaiah. In French, he preferred Corneille to Racine, and Agrippa d‚ÄôAubign√© to Corneille
U||. He loved to saunter through fields of wild oats and corn-flowers, and busied himself with clouds nearly as much as with events. His mind had two attitudes, one on the side towards man, the other on that towards God; he studied or he contemplated. All day long, he buried himself in social questions, salary, capital, credit, marriage, religion, liberty of thought, education, penal servitude, poverty, association, property, production and sharing, the enigma of this lower world which covers the human ant-hill with darkness; and at night, he gazed upon the planets, those enormous beings. Like Enjolras, he was wealthy and an only son. He spoke softly, bowed his head, lowered his eyes, smiled with embarrassment, dressed badly, had an awkward air, blushed at a mere nothing, and was very timid. Yet he was intrepid.
U||Feuilly was a workingman, a fan-maker, orphaned both of father and mother, who earned with difficulty three francs a day, and had but one thought, to deliver the world. He had one other preoccupation, to educate himself; he called this also, delivering himself. He had taught himself to read and write; everything that he knew, he had learned by himself. Feuilly had a generous heart. The range of his embrace was immense. This orphan had adopted the peoples. As his mother had failed him, he meditated on his country. He brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people, over what we now call the idea of the nationality, had learned history with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case. In this club of young Utopians, occupied chiefly with France, he represented the outside world. He had for his specialty Greece, Poland, Hungary, Roumania, Italy. He uttered these names incessantly, appropriately and inappropriately, with the tenacity of right. The violations of Turkey on Greece and
U|| Thessaly, of Russia on Warsaw, of Austria on Venice, enraged him. Above all things, the great violence of 1772 aroused him. There is no more sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation; he was eloquent with that eloquence. He was inexhaustible on that infamous date of 1772, on the subject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason, and that three-sided crime, on that monstrous ambush, the prototype and pattern of all those horrible suppressions of states, which, since that time, have struck many a noble nation, and have annulled their certificate of birth, so to speak. All contemporary social crimes have their origin in the partition of Poland. The partition of Poland is a theorem of which all present political outrages are the corollaries. There has not been a despot, nor a traitor for nearly a century back, who has not signed, approved, counter-signed, and copied, ne variatur, the partition of Poland. When the record of modern treasons was examined, that was the first thing which made its a
U||ppearance. The congress of Vienna consulted that crime before consummating its own. 1772 sounded the onset; 1815 was the death of the game. Such was Feuilly‚Äôs habitual text. This poor workingman had constituted himself the tutor of Justice, and she recompensed him by rendering him great. The fact is, that there is eternity in right. Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be Teuton. Kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to make them so. Sooner or later, the submerged part floats to the surface and reappears. Greece becomes Greece again, Italy is once more Italy. The protest of right against the deed persists forever. The theft of a nation cannot be allowed by prescription. These lofty deeds of rascality have no future. A nation cannot have its mark extracted like a pocket handkerchief.
U||Courfeyrac had a father who was called M. de Courfeyrac. One of the false ideas of the bourgeoisie under the Restoration as regards aristocracy and the nobility was to believe in the particle. The particle, as every one knows, possesses no significance. But the bourgeois of the epoch of la Minerve estimated so highly that poor de, that they thought themselves bound to abdicate it. M. de Chauvelin had himself called M. Chauvelin; M. de Caumartin, M. Caumartin; M. de Constant de Robecque, Benjamin Constant; M. de Lafayette, M. Lafayette. Courfeyrac had not wished to remain behind the rest, and called himself plain Courfeyrac.
U||We might almost, so far as Courfeyrac is concerned, stop here, and confine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains: ‚ÄúFor Courfeyrac, see Tholomy√®s.‚Äù
U||Courfeyrac had, in fact, that animation of youth which may be called the beaut√© du diable of the mind. Later on, this disappears like the playfulness of the kitten, and all this grace ends, with the bourgeois, on two legs, and with the tomcat, on four paws.
U||This sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation of the successive levies of youth who traverse the schools, who pass it from hand to hand, quasi cursores, and is almost always exactly the same; so that, as we have just pointed out, any one who had listened to Courfeyrac in 1828 would have thought he heard Tholomy√®s in 1817. Only, Courfeyrac was an honorable fellow. Beneath the apparent similarities of the exterior mind, the difference between him and Tholomy√®s was very great. The latent man which existed in the two was totally different in the first from what it was in the second. There was in Tholomy√®s a district attorney, and in Courfeyrac a paladin.
U||Enjolras was the chief, Combeferre was the guide, Courfeyrac was the centre. The others gave more light, he shed more warmth; the truth is, that he possessed all the qualities of a centre, roundness and radiance.
U||Bahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of June, 1822, on the occasion of the burial of young Lallemand.
U||Bahorel was a good-natured mortal, who kept bad company, brave, a spendthrift, prodigal, and to the verge of generosity, talkative, and at times eloquent, bold to the verge of effrontery; the best fellow possible; he had daring waistcoats, and scarlet opinions; a wholesale blusterer, that is to say, loving nothing so much as a quarrel, unless it were an uprising; and nothing so much as an uprising, unless it were a revolution; always ready to smash a window-pane, then to tear up the pavement, then to demolish a government, just to see the effect of it; a student in his eleventh year. He had nosed about the law, but did not practise it. He had taken for his device: ‚ÄúNever a lawyer,‚Äù and for his armorial bearings a nightstand in which was visible a square cap. Every time that he passed the law-school, which rarely happened, he buttoned up his frock-coat,‚Äîthe paletot had not yet been invented,‚Äîand took hygienic precautions. Of the school porter he said: ‚ÄúWhat a fine old man!‚Äù and of the dean, M. Del
U||vincourt: ‚ÄúWhat a monument!‚Äù In his lectures he espied subjects for ballads, and in his professors occasions for caricature. He wasted a tolerably large allowance, something like three thousand francs a year, in doing nothing.
U||He had peasant parents whom he had contrived to imbue with respect for their son.
U||He said of them: ‚ÄúThey are peasants and not bourgeois; that is the reason they are intelligent.‚Äù
U||Bahorel, a man of caprice, was scattered over numerous caf√©s; the others had habits, he had none. He sauntered. To stray is human. To saunter is Parisian. In reality, he had a penetrating mind and was more of a thinker than appeared to view.
U||He served as a connecting link between the Friends of the A B C and other still unorganized groups, which were destined to take form later on.
U||In this conclave of young heads, there was one bald member.
U||The Marquis d‚ÄôAvaray, whom Louis XVIII. made a duke for having assisted him to enter a hackney-coach on the day when he emigrated, was wont to relate, that in 1814, on his return to France, as the King was disembarking at Calais, a man handed him a petition.
U||‚ÄúWhat is your request?‚Äù said the King.
U||‚ÄúSire, a post-office.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúL‚ÄôAigle.‚Äù
U||The King frowned, glanced at the signature of the petition and beheld the name written thus: LESGLE. This non-Bonaparte orthography touched the King and he began to smile. ‚ÄúSire,‚Äù resumed the man with the petition, ‚ÄúI had for ancestor a keeper of the hounds surnamed Lesgueules. This surname furnished my name. I am called Lesgueules, by contraction Lesgle, and by corruption l‚ÄôAigle.‚Äù This caused the King to smile broadly. Later on he gave the man the posting office of Meaux, either intentionally or accidentally.
U||The bald member of the group was the son of this Lesgle, or L√©gle, and he signed himself, L√©gle [de Meaux]. As an abbreviation, his companions called him Bossuet.
U||Bossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow. His specialty was not to succeed in anything. As an offset, he laughed at everything. At five and twenty he was bald. His father had ended by owning a house and a field; but he, the son, had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad speculation. He had nothing left. He possessed knowledge and wit, but all he did miscarried. Everything failed him and everybody deceived him; what he was building tumbled down on top of him. If he were splitting wood, he cut off a finger. If he had a mistress, he speedily discovered that he had a friend also. Some misfortune happened to him every moment, hence his joviality. He said: ‚ÄúI live under falling tiles.‚Äù He was not easily astonished, because, for him, an accident was what he had foreseen, he took his bad luck serenely, and smiled at the teasing of fate, like a person who is listening to pleasantries. He was poor, but his fund of good humor was inexhaustible. He soon reached his last sou, never his last burst of laughter. 
U||When adversity entered his doors, he saluted this old acquaintance cordially, he tapped all catastrophes on the stomach; he was familiar with fatality to the point of calling it by its nickname: ‚ÄúGood day, Guignon,‚Äù he said to it.
U||These persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive. He was full of resources. He had no money, but he found means, when it seemed good to him, to indulge in ‚Äúunbridled extravagance.‚Äù One night, he went so far as to eat a ‚Äúhundred francs‚Äù in a supper with a wench, which inspired him to make this memorable remark in the midst of the orgy: ‚ÄúPull off my boots, you five-louis jade.‚Äù
U||Bossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession of a lawyer; he was pursuing his law studies after the manner of Bahorel. Bossuet had not much domicile, sometimes none at all. He lodged now with one, now with another, most often with Joly. Joly was studying medicine. He was two years younger than Bossuet.
U||Joly was the ‚Äúmalade imaginaire‚Äù junior. What he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than a doctor. At three and twenty he thought himself a valetudinarian, and passed his life in inspecting his tongue in the mirror. He affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a needle, and in his chamber he placed his bed with its head to the south, and the foot to the north, so that, at night, the circulation of his blood might not be interfered with by the great electric current of the globe. During thunder storms, he felt his pulse. Otherwise, he was the gayest of them all. All these young, maniacal, puny, merry incoherences lived in harmony together, and the result was an eccentric and agreeable being whom his comrades, who were prodigal of winged consonants, called Jolllly. ‚ÄúYou may fly away on the four L‚Äôs,‚Äù Jean Prouvaire said to him.23
U||Joly had a trick of touching his nose with the tip of his cane, which is an indication of a sagacious mind.
U||All these young men who differed so greatly, and who, on the whole, can only be discussed seriously, held the same religion: Progress.
U||All were the direct sons of the French Revolution. The most giddy of them became solemn when they pronounced that date: ‚Äô89. Their fathers in the flesh had been, either royalists, doctrinaires, it matters not what; this confusion anterior to themselves, who were young, did not concern them at all; the pure blood of principle ran in their veins. They attached themselves, without intermediate shades, to incorruptible right and absolute duty.
U||Affiliated and initiated, they sketched out the ideal underground.
U||Among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds, there was one sceptic. How came he there? By juxtaposition. This sceptic‚Äôs name was Grantaire, and he was in the habit of signing himself with this rebus: R. Grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in anything. Moreover, he was one of the students who had learned the most during their course at Paris; he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the Caf√© Lemblin, and the best billiards at the Caf√© Voltaire, that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the Ermitage, on the Boulevard du Maine, spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget‚Äôs, excellent matelotes at the Barri√®re de la Cunette, and a certain thin white wine at the Barri√®re du Compat. He knew the best place for everything; in addition, boxing and foot-fencing and some dances; and he was a thorough single-stick player. He was a tremendous drinker to boot. He was inordinately homely: the prettiest boot-stitcher of that day, Irma Boissy, enraged with his homeliness, pron
U||ounced sentence on him as follows: ‚ÄúGrantaire is impossible‚Äù; but Grantaire‚Äôs fatuity was not to be disconcerted. He stared tenderly and fixedly at all women, with the air of saying to them all: ‚ÄúIf I only chose!‚Äù and of trying to make his comrades believe that he was in general demand.
U||All those words: rights of the people, rights of man, the social contract, the French Revolution, the Republic, democracy, humanity, civilization, religion, progress, came very near to signifying nothing whatever to Grantaire. He smiled at them. Scepticism, that caries of the intelligence, had not left him a single whole idea. He lived with irony. This was his axiom: ‚ÄúThere is but one certainty, my full glass.‚Äù He sneered at all devotion in all parties, the father as well as the brother, Robespierre junior as well as Loizerolles. ‚ÄúThey are greatly in advance to be dead,‚Äù he exclaimed. He said of the crucifix: ‚ÄúThere is a gibbet which has been a success.‚Äù A rover, a gambler, a libertine, often drunk, he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly: ‚ÄúJ‚Äôaimons les filles, et j‚Äôaimons le bon vin.‚Äù Air: Vive Henri IV.
U||However, this sceptic had one fanaticism. This fanaticism was neither a dogma, nor an idea, nor an art, nor a science; it was a man: Enjolras. Grantaire admired, loved, and venerated Enjolras. To whom did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds? To the most absolute. In what manner had Enjolras subjugated him? By his ideas? No. By his character. A phenomenon which is often observable. A sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of complementary colors. That which we lack attracts us. No one loves the light like the blind man. The dwarf adores the drum-major. The toad always has his eyes fixed on heaven. Why? In order to watch the bird in its flight. Grantaire, in whom writhed doubt, loved to watch faith soar in Enjolras. He had need of Enjolras. That chaste, healthy, firm, upright, hard, candid nature charmed him, without his being clearly aware of it, and without the idea of explaining it to himself having occurred to him. He admired his opposite by instinct. 
U||His soft, yielding, dislocated, sickly, shapeless ideas attached themselves to Enjolras as to a spinal column. His moral backbone leaned on that firmness. Grantaire in the presence of Enjolras became some one once more. He was, himself, moreover, composed of two elements, which were, to all appearance, incompatible. He was ironical and cordial. His indifference loved. His mind could get along without belief, but his heart could not get along without friendship. A profound contradiction; for an affection is a conviction. His nature was thus constituted. There are men who seem to be born to be the reverse, the obverse, the wrong side. They are Pollux, Patrocles, Nisus, Eudamidas, Ephestion, Pechmeja. They only exist on condition that they are backed up with another man; their name is a sequel, and is only written preceded by the conjunction and; and their existence is not their own; it is the other side of an existence which is not theirs. Grantaire was one of these men. He was the obverse of Enjolras.
U||One might almost say that affinities begin with the letters of the alphabet. In the series O and P are inseparable. You can, at will, pronounce O and P or Orestes and Pylades.
U||Grantaire, Enjolras‚Äô true satellite, inhabited this circle of young men; he lived there, he took no pleasure anywhere but there; he followed them everywhere. His joy was to see these forms go and come through the fumes of wine. They tolerated him on account of his good humor.
U||Enjolras, the believer, disdained this sceptic; and, a sober man himself, scorned this drunkard. He accorded him a little lofty pity. Grantaire was an unaccepted Pylades. Always harshly treated by Enjolras, roughly repulsed, rejected yet ever returning to the charge, he said of Enjolras: ‚ÄúWhat fine marble!‚Äù
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîBLONDEAU‚ÄôS FUNERAL ORATION BY BOSSUET
U||On a certain afternoon, which had, as will be seen hereafter, some coincidence with the events heretofore related, Laigle de Meaux was to be seen leaning in a sensual manner against the doorpost of the Caf√© Musain. He had the air of a caryatid on a vacation; he carried nothing but his reverie, however. He was staring at the Place Saint-Michel. To lean one‚Äôs back against a thing is equivalent to lying down while standing erect, which attitude is not hated by thinkers. Laigle de Meaux was pondering without melancholy, over a little misadventure which had befallen him two days previously at the law-school, and which had modified his personal plans for the future, plans which were rather indistinct in any case.
U||Reverie does not prevent a cab from passing by, nor the dreamer from taking note of that cab. Laigle de Meaux, whose eyes were straying about in a sort of diffuse lounging, perceived, athwart his somnambulism, a two-wheeled vehicle proceeding through the place, at a foot pace and apparently in indecision. For whom was this cabriolet? Why was it driving at a walk? Laigle took a survey. In it, beside the coachman, sat a young man, and in front of the young man lay a rather bulky hand-bag. The bag displayed to passers-by the following name inscribed in large black letters on a card which was sewn to the stuff: MARIUS PONTMERCY.
U||This name caused Laigle to change his attitude. He drew himself up and hurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Marius Pontmercy!‚Äù
U||The cabriolet thus addressed came to a halt.
U||The young man, who also seemed deeply buried in thought, raised his eyes:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHey?‚Äù said he.
U||‚ÄúYou are M. Marius Pontmercy?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCertainly.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI was looking for you,‚Äù resumed Laigle de Meaux.
U||‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù demanded Marius; for it was he: in fact, he had just quitted his grandfather‚Äôs, and had before him a face which he now beheld for the first time. ‚ÄúI do not know you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNeither do I know you,‚Äù responded Laigle.
U||Marius thought he had encountered a wag, the beginning of a mystification in the open street. He was not in a very good humor at the moment. He frowned. Laigle de Meaux went on imperturbably:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou were not at the school day before yesterday.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is possible.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is certain.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are a student?‚Äù demanded Marius.
U||‚ÄúYes, sir. Like yourself. Day before yesterday, I entered the school, by chance. You know, one does have such freaks sometimes. The professor was just calling the roll. You are not unaware that they are very ridiculous on such occasions. At the third call, unanswered, your name is erased from the list. Sixty francs in the gulf.‚Äù
U||Marius began to listen.
U||‚ÄúIt was Blondeau who was making the call. You know Blondeau, he has a very pointed and very malicious nose, and he delights to scent out the absent. He slyly began with the letter P. I was not listening, not being compromised by that letter. The call was not going badly. No erasures; the universe was present. Blondeau was grieved. I said to myself: ‚ÄòBlondeau, my love, you will not get the very smallest sort of an execution to-day.‚Äô All at once Blondeau calls, ‚ÄòMarius Pontmercy!‚Äô No one answers. Blondeau, filled with hope, repeats more loudly: ‚ÄòMarius Pontmercy!‚Äô And he takes his pen. Monsieur, I have bowels of compassion. I said to myself hastily: ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs a brave fellow who is going to get scratched out. Attention. Here is a veritable mortal who is not exact. He‚Äôs not a good student. Here is none of your heavy-sides, a student who studies, a greenhorn pedant, strong on letters, theology, science, and sapience, one of those dull wits cut by the square; a pin by profession. He is an honorab
U||le idler who lounges, who practises country jaunts, who cultivates the grisette, who pays court to the fair sex, who is at this very moment, perhaps, with my mistress. Let us save him. Death to Blondeau!‚Äô At that moment, Blondeau dipped his pen in, all black with erasures in the ink, cast his yellow eyes round the audience room, and repeated for the third time: ‚ÄòMarius Pontmercy!‚Äô I replied: ‚ÄòPresent!‚Äô This is why you were not crossed off.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMonsieur!‚Äî‚Äù said Marius.
U||‚ÄúAnd why I was,‚Äù added Laigle de Meaux.
U||‚ÄúI do not understand you,‚Äù said Marius.
U||Laigle resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúNothing is more simple. I was close to the desk to reply, and close to the door for the purpose of flight. The professor gazed at me with a certain intensity. All of a sudden, Blondeau, who must be the malicious nose alluded to by Boileau, skipped to the letter L. L is my letter. I am from Meaux, and my name is Lesgle.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúL‚ÄôAigle!‚Äù interrupted Marius, ‚Äúwhat fine name!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMonsieur, Blondeau came to this fine name, and called: ‚ÄòLaigle!‚Äô I reply: ‚ÄòPresent!‚Äô Then Blondeau gazes at me, with the gentleness of a tiger, and says to me: ‚ÄòIf you are Pontmercy, you are not Laigle.‚Äô A phrase which has a disobliging air for you, but which was lugubrious only for me. That said, he crossed me off.‚Äù
U||Marius exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am mortified, sir‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFirst of all,‚Äù interposed Laigle, ‚ÄúI demand permission to embalm Blondeau in a few phrases of deeply felt eulogium. I will assume that he is dead. There will be no great change required in his gauntness, in his pallor, in his coldness, and in his smell. And I say: ‚ÄòErudimini qui judicatis terram. Here lies Blondeau, Blondeau the Nose, Blondeau Nasica, the ox of discipline, bos disciplin√¶, the bloodhound of the password, the angel of the roll-call, who was upright, square, exact, rigid, honest, and hideous. God crossed him off as he crossed me off.‚Äô‚Äù
U||Marius resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am very sorry‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYoung man,‚Äù said Laigle de Meaux, ‚Äúlet this serve you as a lesson. In future, be exact.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI really beg you a thousand pardons.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDo not expose your neighbor to the danger of having his name erased again.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am extremely sorry‚Äî‚Äù
U||Laigle burst out laughing.
U||‚ÄúAnd I am delighted. I was on the brink of becoming a lawyer. This erasure saves me. I renounce the triumphs of the bar. I shall not defend the widow, and I shall not attack the orphan. No more toga, no more stage. Here is my erasure all ready for me. It is to you that I am indebted for it, Monsieur Pontmercy. I intend to pay a solemn call of thanks upon you. Where do you live?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn this cab,‚Äù said Marius.
U||‚ÄúA sign of opulence,‚Äù retorted Laigle calmly. ‚ÄúI congratulate you. You have there a rent of nine thousand francs per annum.‚Äù
U||At that moment, Courfeyrac emerged from the caf√©.
U||Marius smiled sadly.
U||‚ÄúI have paid this rent for the last two hours, and I aspire to get rid of it; but there is a sort of history attached to it, and I don‚Äôt know where to go.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCome to my place, sir,‚Äù said Courfeyrac.
U||‚ÄúI have the priority,‚Äù observed Laigle, ‚Äúbut I have no home.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHold your tongue, Bossuet,‚Äù said Courfeyrac.
U||‚ÄúBossuet,‚Äù said Marius, ‚Äúbut I thought that your name was Laigle.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDe Meaux,‚Äù replied Laigle; ‚Äúby metaphor, Bossuet.‚Äù
U||Courfeyrac entered the cab.
U||‚ÄúCoachman,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúhotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques.‚Äù
U||And that very evening, Marius found himself installed in a chamber of the hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques side by side with Courfeyrac.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîMARIUS‚Äô ASTONISHMENTS
U||In a few days, Marius had become Courfeyrac‚Äôs friend. Youth is the season for prompt welding and the rapid healing of scars. Marius breathed freely in Courfeyrac‚Äôs society, a decidedly new thing for him. Courfeyrac put no questions to him. He did not even think of such a thing. At that age, faces disclose everything on the spot. Words are superfluous. There are young men of whom it can be said that their countenances chatter. One looks at them and one knows them.
U||One morning, however, Courfeyrac abruptly addressed this interrogation to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBy the way, have you any political opinions?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe idea!‚Äù said Marius, almost affronted by the question.
U||‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA democrat-Bonapartist.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe gray hue of a reassured rat,‚Äù said Courfeyrac.
U||On the following day, Courfeyrac introduced Marius at the Caf√© Musain. Then he whispered in his ear, with a smile: ‚ÄúI must give you your entry to the revolution.‚Äù And he led him to the hall of the Friends of the A B C. He presented him to the other comrades, saying this simple word which Marius did not understand: ‚ÄúA pupil.‚Äù
U||Marius had fallen into a wasps‚Äô-nest of wits. However, although he was silent and grave, he was, nonetheless, both winged and armed.
U||Marius, up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy, and to asides, both by habit and by taste, was a little fluttered by this covey of young men around him. All these various initiatives solicited his attention at once, and pulled him about. The tumultuous movements of these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl. Sometimes, in his trouble, they fled so far from him, that he had difficulty in recovering them. He heard them talk of philosophy, of literature, of art, of history, of religion, in unexpected fashion. He caught glimpses of strange aspects; and, as he did not place them in proper perspective, he was not altogether sure that it was not chaos that he grasped. On abandoning his grandfather‚Äôs opinions for the opinions of his father, he had supposed himself fixed; he now suspected, with uneasiness, and without daring to avow it to himself, that he was not. The angle at which he saw everything began to be displaced anew. A certain oscillation set all the horizons of his brains in
U|| motion. An odd internal upsetting. He almost suffered from it.
U||It seemed as though there were no ‚Äúconsecrated things‚Äù for those young men. Marius heard singular propositions on every sort of subject, which embarrassed his still timid mind.
U||A theatre poster presented itself, adorned with the title of a tragedy from the ancient repertory called classic: ‚ÄúDown with tragedy dear to the bourgeois!‚Äù cried Bahorel. And Marius heard Combeferre reply:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou are wrong, Bahorel. The bourgeoisie loves tragedy, and the bourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score. Bewigged tragedy has a reason for its existence, and I am not one of those who, by order of √Üschylus, contest its right to existence. There are rough outlines in nature; there are, in creation, ready-made parodies; a beak which is not a beak, wings which are not wings, gills which are not gills, paws which are not paws, a cry of pain which arouses a desire to laugh, there is the duck. Now, since poultry exists by the side of the bird, I do not see why classic tragedy should not exist in the face of antique tragedy.‚Äù
U||Or chance decreed that Marius should traverse Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau between Enjolras and Courfeyrac.
U||Courfeyrac took his arm:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúPay attention. This is the Rue Pl√¢tri√®re, now called Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau, on account of a singular household which lived in it sixty years ago. This consisted of Jean-Jacques and Th√©r√®se. From time to time, little beings were born there. Th√©r√®se gave birth to them, Jean-Jacques represented them as foundlings.‚Äù
U||And Enjolras addressed Courfeyrac roughly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSilence in the presence of Jean-Jacques! I admire that man. He denied his own children, that may be; but he adopted the people.‚Äù
U||Not one of these young men articulated the word: The Emperor. Jean Prouvaire alone sometimes said Napoleon; all the others said ‚ÄúBonaparte.‚Äù Enjolras pronounced it ‚ÄúBuonaparte.‚Äù
U||Marius was vaguely surprised. Initium sapienti√¶.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîTHE BACK ROOM OF THE CAF√â MUSAIN
U||One of the conversations among the young men, at which Marius was present and in which he sometimes joined, was a veritable shock to his mind.
U||This took place in the back room of the Caf√© Musain. Nearly all the Friends of the A B C had convened that evening. The argand lamp was solemnly lighted. They talked of one thing and another, without passion and with noise. With the exception of Enjolras and Marius, who held their peace, all were haranguing rather at hap-hazard. Conversations between comrades sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults. It was a game and an uproar as much as a conversation. They tossed words to each other and caught them up in turn. They were chattering in all quarters.
U||No woman was admitted to this back room, except Louison, the dish-washer of the caf√©, who passed through it from time to time, to go to her washing in the ‚Äúlavatory.‚Äù
U||Grantaire, thoroughly drunk, was deafening the corner of which he had taken possession, reasoning and contradicting at the top of his lungs, and shouting:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI am thirsty. Mortals, I am dreaming: that the tun of Heidelberg has an attack of apoplexy, and that I am one of the dozen leeches which will be applied to it. I want a drink. I desire to forget life. Life is a hideous invention of I know not whom. It lasts no time at all, and is worth nothing. One breaks one‚Äôs neck in living. Life is a theatre set in which there are but few practicable entrances. Happiness is an antique reliquary painted on one side only. Ecclesiastes says: ‚ÄòAll is vanity.‚Äô I agree with that good man, who never existed, perhaps. Zero not wishing to go stark naked, clothed himself in vanity. O vanity! The patching up of everything with big words! a kitchen is a laboratory, a dancer is a professor, an acrobat is a gymnast, a boxer is a pugilist, an apothecary is a chemist, a wigmaker is an artist, a hodman is an architect, a jockey is a sportsman, a wood-louse is a pterigybranche. Vanity has a right and a wrong side; the right side is stupid, it is the negro with his glass beads; the
U|| wrong side is foolish, it is the philosopher with his rags. I weep over the one and I laugh over the other. What are called honors and dignities, and even dignity and honor, are generally of pinchbeck. Kings make playthings of human pride. Caligula made a horse a consul; Charles II. made a knight of a sirloin. Wrap yourself up now, then, between Consul Incitatus and Baronet Roastbeef. As for the intrinsic value of people, it is no longer respectable in the least. Listen to the panegyric which neighbor makes of neighbor. White on white is ferocious; if the lily could speak, what a setting down it would give the dove! A bigoted woman prating of a devout woman is more venomous than the asp and the cobra. It is a shame that I am ignorant, otherwise I would quote to you a mass of things; but I know nothing. For instance, I have always been witty; when I was a pupil of Gros, instead of daubing wretched little pictures, I passed my time in pilfering apples; rapin24 is the masculine of rapine. So much for myself; a
U||s for the rest of you, you are worth no more than I am. I scoff at your perfections, excellencies, and qualities. Every good quality tends towards a defect; economy borders on avarice, the generous man is next door to the prodigal, the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart; he who says very pious says a trifle bigoted; there are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in Diogenes‚Äô cloak. Whom do you admire, the slain or the slayer, C√¶sar or Brutus? Generally men are in favor of the slayer. Long live Brutus, he has slain! There lies the virtue. Virtue, granted, but madness also. There are queer spots on those great men. The Brutus who killed C√¶sar was in love with the statue of a little boy. This statue was from the hand of the Greek sculptor Strongylion, who also carved that figure of an Amazon known as the Beautiful Leg, Eucnemos, which Nero carried with him in his travels. This Strongylion left but two statues which placed Nero and Brutus in accord. Brutus was in love with the one, Nero with 
U||the other. All history is nothing but wearisome repetition. One century is the plagiarist of the other. The battle of Marengo copies the battle of Pydna; the Tolbiac of Clovis and the Austerlitz of Napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water. I don‚Äôt attach much importance to victory. Nothing is so stupid as to conquer; true glory lies in convincing. But try to prove something! If you are content with success, what mediocrity, and with conquering, what wretchedness! Alas, vanity and cowardice everywhere. Everything obeys success, even grammar. Si volet usus, says Horace. Therefore I disdain the human race. Shall we descend to the party at all? Do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples? What people, if you please? Shall it be Greece? The Athenians, those Parisians of days gone by, slew Phocion, as we might say Coligny, and fawned upon tyrants to such an extent that Anacephorus said of Pisistratus: ‚ÄúHis urine attracts the bees.‚Äù The most prominent man in Greece for fifty years was that gramm
U||arian Philetas, who was so small and so thin that he was obliged to load his shoes with lead in order not to be blown away by the wind. There stood on the great square in Corinth a statue carved by Silanion and catalogued by Pliny; this statue represented Episthates. What did Episthates do? He invented a trip. That sums up Greece and glory. Let us pass on to others. Shall I admire England? Shall I admire France? France? Why? Because of Paris? I have just told you my opinion of Athens. England? Why? Because of London? I hate Carthage. And then, London, the metropolis of luxury, is the headquarters of wretchedness. There are a hundred deaths a year of hunger in the parish of Charing-Cross alone. Such is Albion. I add, as the climax, that I have seen an Englishwoman dancing in a wreath of roses and blue spectacles. A fig then for England! If I do not admire John Bull, shall I admire Brother Jonathan? I have but little taste for that slave-holding brother. Take away Time is money, what remains of England? Take a
U||way Cotton is king, what remains of America? Germany is the lymph, Italy is the bile. Shall we go into ecstasies over Russia? Voltaire admired it. He also admired China. I admit that Russia has its beauties, among others, a stout despotism; but I pity the despots. Their health is delicate. A decapitated Alexis, a poignarded Peter, a strangled Paul, another Paul crushed flat with kicks, divers Ivans strangled, with their throats cut, numerous Nicholases and Basils poisoned, all this indicates that the palace of the Emperors of Russia is in a condition of flagrant insalubrity. All civilized peoples offer this detail to the admiration of the thinker; war; now, war, civilized war, exhausts and sums up all the forms of ruffianism, from the brigandage of the Trabuceros in the gorges of Mont Jaxa to the marauding of the Comanche Indians in the Doubtful Pass. ‚ÄòBah!‚Äô you will say to me, ‚Äòbut Europe is certainly better than Asia?‚Äô I admit that Asia is a farce; but I do not precisely see what you find to laugh 
U||at in the Grand Lama, you peoples of the west, who have mingled with your fashions and your elegances all the complicated filth of majesty, from the dirty chemise of Queen Isabella to the chamber-chair of the Dauphin. Gentlemen of the human race, I tell you, not a bit of it! It is at Brussels that the most beer is consumed, at Stockholm the most brandy, at Madrid the most chocolate, at Amsterdam the most gin, at London the most wine, at Constantinople the most coffee, at Paris the most absinthe; there are all the useful notions. Paris carries the day, in short. In Paris, even the rag-pickers are sybarites; Diogenes would have loved to be a rag-picker of the Place Maubert better than to be a philosopher at the Pir√¶us. Learn this in addition; the wineshops of the rag-pickers are called bibines; the most celebrated are the Saucepan and The Slaughter-House. Hence, tea-gardens, goguettes, caboulots, bouibuis, mastroquets, bastringues, manezingues, bibines of the rag-pickers, caravanseries of the caliphs, I certi
U||fy to you, I am a voluptuary, I eat at Richard‚Äôs at forty sous a head, I must have Persian carpets to roll naked Cleopatra in! Where is Cleopatra? Ah! So it is you, Louison. Good day.‚Äù
U||Thus did Grantaire, more than intoxicated, launch into speech, catching at the dish-washer in her passage, from his corner in the back room of the Caf√© Musain.
U||Bossuet, extending his hand towards him, tried to impose silence on him, and Grantaire began again worse than ever:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAigle de Meaux, down with your paws. You produce on me no effect with your gesture of Hippocrates refusing Artaxerxes‚Äô bric-√†-brac. I excuse you from the task of soothing me. Moreover, I am sad. What do you wish me to say to you? Man is evil, man is deformed; the butterfly is a success, man is a failure. God made a mistake with that animal. A crowd offers a choice of ugliness. The first comer is a wretch, Femme‚Äîwoman‚Äîrhymes with inf√¢me,‚Äîinfamous. Yes, I have the spleen, complicated with melancholy, with homesickness, plus hypochondria, and I am vexed and I rage, and I yawn, and I am bored, and I am tired to death, and I am stupid! Let God go to the devil!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSilence then, capital R!‚Äù resumed Bossuet, who was discussing a point of law behind the scenes, and who was plunged more than waist high in a phrase of judicial slang, of which this is the conclusion:‚Äî
U||‚Äú‚ÄîAnd as for me, although I am hardly a legist, and at the most, an amateur attorney, I maintain this: that, in accordance with the terms of the customs of Normandy, at Saint-Michel, and for each year, an equivalent must be paid to the profit of the lord of the manor, saving the rights of others, and by all and several, the proprietors as well as those seized with inheritance, and that, for all emphyteuses, leases, freeholds, contracts of domain, mortgages‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúEcho, plaintive nymph,‚Äù hummed Grantaire.
U||Near Grantaire, an almost silent table, a sheet of paper, an inkstand and a pen between two glasses of brandy, announced that a vaudeville was being sketched out.
U||This great affair was being discussed in a low voice, and the two heads at work touched each other: ‚ÄúLet us begin by finding names. When one has the names, one finds the subject.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is true. Dictate. I will write.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Dorimon.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAn independent gentleman?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHis daughter, C√©lestine.‚Äù
U||‚Äú‚Äîtine. What next?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúColonel Sainval.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSainval is stale. I should say Valsin.‚Äù
U||Beside the vaudeville aspirants, another group, which was also taking advantage of the uproar to talk low, was discussing a duel. An old fellow of thirty was counselling a young one of eighteen, and explaining to him what sort of an adversary he had to deal with.
U||‚ÄúThe deuce! Look out for yourself. He is a fine swordsman. His play is neat. He has the attack, no wasted feints, wrist, dash, lightning, a just parade, mathematical parries, bigre! and he is left-handed.‚Äù
U||In the angle opposite Grantaire, Joly and Bahorel were playing dominoes, and talking of love.
U||‚ÄúYou are in luck, that you are,‚Äù Joly was saying. ‚ÄúYou have a mistress who is always laughing.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is a fault of hers,‚Äù returned Bahorel. ‚ÄúOne‚Äôs mistress does wrong to laugh. That encourages one to deceive her. To see her gay removes your remorse; if you see her sad, your conscience pricks you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIngrate! a woman who laughs is such a good thing! And you never quarrel!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is because of the treaty which we have made. On forming our little Holy Alliance we assigned ourselves each our frontier, which we never cross. What is situated on the side of winter belongs to Vaud, on the side of the wind to Gex. Hence the peace.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPeace is happiness digesting.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd you, Jolllly, where do you stand in your entanglement with Mamselle‚Äîyou know whom I mean?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúShe sulks at me with cruel patience.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYet you are a lover to soften the heart with gauntness.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAlas!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn your place, I would let her alone.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is easy enough to say.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd to do. Is not her name Musichetta?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes. Ah! my poor Bahorel, she is a superb girl, very literary, with tiny feet, little hands, she dresses well, and is white and dimpled, with the eyes of a fortune-teller. I am wild over her.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMy dear fellow, then in order to please her, you must be elegant, and produce effects with your knees. Buy a good pair of trousers of double-milled cloth at Staub‚Äôs. That will assist.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAt what price?‚Äù shouted Grantaire.
U||The third corner was delivered up to a poetical discussion. Pagan mythology was giving battle to Christian mythology. The question was about Olympus, whose part was taken by Jean Prouvaire, out of pure romanticism.
U||Jean Prouvaire was timid only in repose. Once excited, he burst forth, a sort of mirth accentuated his enthusiasm, and he was at once both laughing and lyric.
U||‚ÄúLet us not insult the gods,‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúThe gods may not have taken their departure. Jupiter does not impress me as dead. The gods are dreams, you say. Well, even in nature, such as it is to-day, after the flight of these dreams, we still find all the grand old pagan myths. Such and such a mountain with the profile of a citadel, like the Vignemale, for example, is still to me the headdress of Cybele; it has not been proved to me that Pan does not come at night to breathe into the hollow trunks of the willows, stopping up the holes in turn with his fingers, and I have always believed that Io had something to do with the cascade of Pissevache.‚Äù
U||In the last corner, they were talking politics. The Charter which had been granted was getting roughly handled. Combeferre was upholding it weakly. Courfeyrac was energetically making a breach in it. On the table lay an unfortunate copy of the famous Touquet Charter. Courfeyrac had seized it, and was brandishing it, mingling with his arguments the rattling of this sheet of paper.
U||‚ÄúIn the first place, I won‚Äôt have any kings; if it were only from an economical point of view, I don‚Äôt want any; a king is a parasite. One does not have kings gratis. Listen to this: the dearness of kings. At the death of Fran√ßois I., the national debt of France amounted to an income of thirty thousand livres; at the death of Louis XIV. it was two milliards, six hundred millions, at twenty-eight livres the mark, which was equivalent in 1760, according to Desmarets, to four milliards, five hundred millions, which would to-day be equivalent to twelve milliards. In the second place, and no offence to Combeferre, a charter granted is but a poor expedient of civilization. To save the transition, to soften the passage, to deaden the shock, to cause the nation to pass insensibly from the monarchy to democracy by the practice of constitutional fictions,‚Äîwhat detestable reasons all those are! No! no! let us never enlighten the people with false daylight. Principles dwindle and pale in your constitutional cel
U||lar. No illegitimacy, no compromise, no grant from the king to the people. In all such grants there is an Article 14. By the side of the hand which gives there is the claw which snatches back. I refuse your charter point-blank. A charter is a mask; the lie lurks beneath it. A people which accepts a charter abdicates. The law is only the law when entire. No! no charter!‚Äù
U||It was winter; a couple of fagots were crackling in the fireplace. This was tempting, and Courfeyrac could not resist. He crumpled the poor Touquet Charter in his fist, and flung it in the fire. The paper flashed up. Combeferre watched the masterpiece of Louis XVIII. burn philosophically, and contented himself with saying:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe charter metamorphosed into flame.‚Äù
U||And sarcasms, sallies, jests, that French thing which is called entrain, and that English thing which is called humor, good and bad taste, good and bad reasons, all the wild pyrotechnics of dialogue, mounting together and crossing from all points of the room, produced a sort of merry bombardment over their heads.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîENLARGEMENT OF HORIZON
U||The shocks of youthful minds among themselves have this admirable property, that one can never foresee the spark, nor divine the lightning flash. What will dart out presently? No one knows. The burst of laughter starts from a tender feeling.
U||At the moment of jest, the serious makes its entry. Impulses depend on the first chance word. The spirit of each is sovereign, jest suffices to open the field to the unexpected. These are conversations with abrupt turns, in which the perspective changes suddenly. Chance is the stage-manager of such conversations.
U||A severe thought, starting oddly from a clash of words, suddenly traversed the conflict of quips in which Grantaire, Bahorel, Prouvaire, Bossuet, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac were confusedly fencing.
U||How does a phrase crop up in a dialogue? Whence comes it that it suddenly impresses itself on the attention of those who hear it? We have just said, that no one knows anything about it. In the midst of the uproar, Bossuet all at once terminated some apostrophe to Combeferre, with this date:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúJune 18th, 1815, Waterloo.‚Äù
U||At this name of Waterloo, Marius, who was leaning his elbows on a table, beside a glass of water, removed his wrist from beneath his chin, and began to gaze fixedly at the audience.
U||‚ÄúPardieu!‚Äù exclaimed Courfeyrac (‚ÄúParbleu‚Äù was falling into disuse at this period), ‚Äúthat number 18 is strange and strikes me. It is Bonaparte‚Äôs fatal number. Place Louis in front and Brumaire behind, you have the whole destiny of the man, with this significant peculiarity, that the end treads close on the heels of the commencement.‚Äù
U||Enjolras, who had remained mute up to that point, broke the silence and addressed this remark to Combeferre:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou mean to say, the crime and the expiation.‚Äù
U||This word crime overpassed the measure of what Marius, who was already greatly agitated by the abrupt evocation of Waterloo, could accept.
U||He rose, walked slowly to the map of France spread out on the wall, and at whose base an island was visible in a separate compartment, laid his finger on this compartment and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCorsica, a little island which has rendered France very great.‚Äù
U||This was like a breath of icy air. All ceased talking. They felt that something was on the point of occurring.
U||Bahorel, replying to Bossuet, was just assuming an attitude of the torso to which he was addicted. He gave it up to listen.
U||Enjolras, whose blue eye was not fixed on any one, and who seemed to be gazing at space, replied, without glancing at Marius:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFrance needs no Corsica to be great. France is great because she is France. Quia nomina leo.‚Äù
U||Marius felt no desire to retreat; he turned towards Enjolras, and his voice burst forth with a vibration which came from a quiver of his very being:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGod forbid that I should diminish France! But amalgamating Napoleon with her is not diminishing her. Come! let us argue the question. I am a newcomer among you, but I will confess that you amaze me. Where do we stand? Who are we? Who are you? Who am I? Let us come to an explanation about the Emperor. I hear you say Buonaparte, accenting the u like the Royalists. I warn you that my grandfather does better still; he says Buonapart√©‚Äô. I thought you were young men. Where, then, is your enthusiasm? And what are you doing with it? Whom do you admire, if you do not admire the Emperor? And what more do you want? If you will have none of that great man, what great men would you like? He had everything. He was complete. He had in his brain the sum of human faculties. He made codes like Justinian, he dictated like C√¶sar, his conversation was mingled with the lightning-flash of Pascal, with the thunderclap of Tacitus, he made history and he wrote it, his bulletins are Iliads, he combined the cipher of Newton with
U|| the metaphor of Mahomet, he left behind him in the East words as great as the pyramids, at Tilsit he taught Emperors majesty, at the Academy of Sciences he replied to Laplace, in the Council of State he held his own against Merlin, he gave a soul to the geometry of the first, and to the chicanery of the last, he was a legist with the attorneys and sidereal with the astronomers; like Cromwell blowing out one of two candles, he went to the Temple to bargain for a curtain tassel; he saw everything; he knew everything; which did not prevent him from laughing good-naturedly beside the cradle of his little child; and all at once, frightened Europe lent an ear, armies put themselves in motion, parks of artillery rumbled, pontoons stretched over the rivers, clouds of cavalry galloped in the storm, cries, trumpets, a trembling of thrones in every direction, the frontiers of kingdoms oscillated on the map, the sound of a superhuman sword was heard, as it was drawn from its sheath; they beheld him, him, rise erect on 
U||the horizon with a blazing brand in his hand, and a glow in his eyes, unfolding amid the thunder, his two wings, the grand army and the old guard, and he was the archangel of war!‚Äù
U||All held their peace, and Enjolras bowed his head. Silence always produces somewhat the effect of acquiescence, of the enemy being driven to the wall. Marius continued with increased enthusiasm, and almost without pausing for breath:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLet us be just, my friends! What a splendid destiny for a nation to be the Empire of such an Emperor, when that nation is France and when it adds its own genius to the genius of that man! To appear and to reign, to march and to triumph, to have for halting-places all capitals, to take his grenadiers and to make kings of them, to decree the falls of dynasties, and to transfigure Europe at the pace of a charge; to make you feel that when you threaten you lay your hand on the hilt of the sword of God; to follow in a single man, Hannibal, C√¶sar, Charlemagne; to be the people of some one who mingles with your dawns the startling announcement of a battle won, to have the cannon of the Invalides to rouse you in the morning, to hurl into abysses of light prodigious words which flame forever, Marengo, Arcola, Austerlitz, Jena, Wagram! To cause constellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from the zenith of the centuries, to make the French Empire a pendant to the Roman Empire, to be the great nation
U|| and to give birth to the grand army, to make its legions fly forth over all the earth, as a mountain sends out its eagles on all sides to conquer, to dominate, to strike with lightning, to be in Europe a sort of nation gilded through glory, to sound athwart the centuries a trumpet-blast of Titans, to conquer the world twice, by conquest and by dazzling, that is sublime; and what greater thing is there?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo be free,‚Äù said Combeferre.
U||Marius lowered his head in his turn; that cold and simple word had traversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel, and he felt it vanishing within him. When he raised his eyes, Combeferre was no longer there. Probably satisfied with his reply to the apotheosis, he had just taken his departure, and all, with the exception of Enjolras, had followed him. The room had been emptied. Enjolras, left alone with Marius, was gazing gravely at him. Marius, however, having rallied his ideas to some extent, did not consider himself beaten; there lingered in him a trace of inward fermentation which was on the point, no doubt, of translating itself into syllogisms arrayed against Enjolras, when all of a sudden, they heard some one singing on the stairs as he went. It was Combeferre, and this is what he was singing:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSi C√©sar m‚Äôavait donn√©
U||    La gloire et la guerre,
U||Et qu‚Äôil me fallait quitter
U||    L‚Äôamour de ma m√®re,
U||Je dirais au grand C√©sar:
U||    Reprends ton sceptre et ton char,
U||J‚Äôaime mieux ma m√®re, √¥ gu√©!
U||    J‚Äôaime mieux ma m√®re!‚Äù25
U||The wild and tender accents with which Combeferre sang communicated to this couplet a sort of strange grandeur. Marius, thoughtfully, and with his eyes diked on the ceiling, repeated almost mechanically: ‚ÄúMy mother?‚Äî‚Äù
U||At that moment, he felt Enjolras‚Äô hand on his shoulder.
U||‚ÄúCitizen,‚Äù said Enjolras to him, ‚Äúmy mother is the Republic.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîRES ANGUSTA
U||That evening left Marius profoundly shaken, and with a melancholy shadow in his soul. He felt what the earth may possibly feel, at the moment when it is torn open with the iron, in order that grain may be deposited within it; it feels only the wound; the quiver of the germ and the joy of the fruit only arrive later.
U||Marius was gloomy. He had but just acquired a faith; must he then reject it already? He affirmed to himself that he would not. He declared to himself that he would not doubt, and he began to doubt in spite of himself. To stand between two religions, from one of which you have not as yet emerged, and another into which you have not yet entered, is intolerable; and twilight is pleasing only to bat-like souls. Marius was clear-eyed, and he required the true light. The half-lights of doubt pained him. Whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was, he could not halt there, he was irresistibly constrained to continue, to advance, to examine, to think, to march further. Whither would this lead him? He feared, after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father, to now take a step which should estrange him from that father. His discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him. An escarpment rose around him. He was in accord neither with his grandfather nor with
U|| his friends; daring in the eyes of the one, he was behind the times in the eyes of the others, and he recognized the fact that he was doubly isolated, on the side of age and on the side of youth. He ceased to go to the Caf√© Musain.
U||In the troubled state of his conscience, he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence. The realities of life do not allow themselves to be forgotten. They soon elbowed him abruptly.
U||One morning, the proprietor of the hotel entered Marius‚Äô room and said to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Courfeyrac answered for you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut I must have my money.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúRequest Courfeyrac to come and talk with me,‚Äù said Marius.
U||Courfeyrac having made his appearance, the host left them. Marius then told him what it had not before occurred to him to relate, that he was the same as alone in the world, and had no relatives.
U||‚ÄúWhat is to become of you?‚Äù said Courfeyrac.
U||‚ÄúI do not know in the least,‚Äù replied Marius.
U||‚ÄúWhat are you going to do?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI do not know.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHave you any money?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFifteen francs.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDo you want me to lend you some?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNever.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHave you clothes?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHere is what I have.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHave you trinkets?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA watch.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSilver?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGold; here it is.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI know a clothes-dealer who will take your frock-coat and a pair of trousers.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is good.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou will then have only a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, a hat and a coat.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd my boots.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat! you will not go barefoot? What opulence!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat will be enough.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI know a watchmaker who will buy your watch.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is good.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo; it is not good. What will you do after that?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhatever is necessary. Anything honest, that is to say.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDo you know English?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDo you know German?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSo much the worse.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBecause one of my friends, a publisher, is getting up a sort of an encyclop√¶dia, for which you might have translated English or German articles. It is badly paid work, but one can live by it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will learn English and German.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd in the meanwhile?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn the meanwhile I will live on my clothes and my watch.‚Äù
U||The clothes-dealer was sent for. He paid twenty francs for the cast-off garments. They went to the watchmaker‚Äôs. He bought the watch for forty-five francs.
U||‚ÄúThat is not bad,‚Äù said Marius to Courfeyrac, on their return to the hotel, ‚Äúwith my fifteen francs, that makes eighty.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd the hotel bill?‚Äù observed Courfeyrac.
U||‚ÄúHello, I had forgotten that,‚Äù said Marius.
U||The landlord presented his bill, which had to be paid on the spot. It amounted to seventy francs.
U||‚ÄúI have ten francs left,‚Äù said Marius.
U||‚ÄúThe deuce,‚Äù exclaimed Courfeyrac, ‚Äúyou will eat up five francs while you are learning English, and five while learning German. That will be swallowing a tongue very fast, or a hundred sous very slowly.‚Äù
U||In the meantime Aunt Gillenormand, a rather good-hearted person at bottom in difficulties, had finally hunted up Marius‚Äô abode.
U||One morning, on his return from the law-school, Marius found a letter from his aunt, and the sixty pistoles, that is to say, six hundred francs in gold, in a sealed box.
U||Marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt, with a respectful letter, in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs. At that moment, he had three francs left.
U||His aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him. Besides, had he not said: ‚ÄúLet me never hear the name of that blood-drinker again!‚Äù
U||Marius left the hotel de la Porte Saint-Jacques, as he did not wish to run in debt there.
U||BOOK FIFTH‚ÄîTHE EXCELLENCE OF MISFORTUNE
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîMARIUS INDIGENT
U||Excellence of Misfortune
U||Life became hard for Marius. It was nothing to eat his clothes and his watch. He ate of that terrible, inexpressible thing that is called de la vache enrag√©; that is to say, he endured great hardships and privations. A terrible thing it is, containing days without bread, nights without sleep, evenings without a candle, a hearth without a fire, weeks without work, a future without hope, a coat out at the elbows, an old hat which evokes the laughter of young girls, a door which one finds locked on one at night because one‚Äôs rent is not paid, the insolence of the porter and the cook-shop man, the sneers of neighbors, humiliations, dignity trampled on, work of whatever nature accepted, disgusts, bitterness, despondency. Marius learned how all this is eaten, and how such are often the only things which one has to devour. At that moment of his existence when a man needs his pride, because he needs love, he felt that he was jeered at because he was badly dressed, and ridiculous because he was poor. At the age wh
U||en youth swells the heart with imperial pride, he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots, and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness. Admirable and terrible trial from which the feeble emerge base, from which the strong emerge sublime. A crucible into which destiny casts a man, whenever it desires a scoundrel or a demi-god.
U||For many great deeds are performed in petty combats. There are instances of bravery ignored and obstinate, which defend themselves step by step in that fatal onslaught of necessities and turpitudes. Noble and mysterious triumphs which no eye beholds, which are requited with no renown, which are saluted with no trumpet blast. Life, misfortune, isolation, abandonment, poverty, are the fields of battle which have their heroes; obscure heroes, who are, sometimes, grander than the heroes who win renown.
U||Firm and rare natures are thus created; misery, almost always a step-mother, is sometimes a mother; destitution gives birth to might of soul and spirit; distress is the nurse of pride; unhappiness is a good milk for the magnanimous.
U||There came a moment in Marius‚Äô life, when he swept his own landing, when he bought his sou‚Äôs worth of Brie cheese at the fruiterer‚Äôs, when he waited until twilight had fallen to slip into the baker‚Äôs and purchase a loaf, which he carried off furtively to his attic as though he had stolen it. Sometimes there could be seen gliding into the butcher‚Äôs shop on the corner, in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed him, an awkward young man, carrying big books under his arm, who had a timid yet angry air, who, on entering, removed his hat from a brow whereon stood drops of perspiration, made a profound bow to the butcher‚Äôs astonished wife, asked for a mutton cutlet, paid six or seven sous for it, wrapped it up in a paper, put it under his arm, between two books, and went away. It was Marius. On this cutlet, which he cooked for himself, he lived for three days.
U||On the first day he ate the meat, on the second he ate the fat, on the third he gnawed the bone. Aunt Gillenormand made repeated attempts, and sent him the sixty pistoles several times. Marius returned them on every occasion, saying that he needed nothing.
U||He was still in mourning for his father when the revolution which we have just described was effected within him. From that time forth, he had not put off his black garments. But his garments were quitting him. The day came when he had no longer a coat. The trousers would go next. What was to be done? Courfeyrac, to whom he had, on his side, done some good turns, gave him an old coat. For thirty sous, Marius got it turned by some porter or other, and it was a new coat. But this coat was green. Then Marius ceased to go out until after nightfall. This made his coat black. As he wished always to appear in mourning, he clothed himself with the night.
U||In spite of all this, he got admitted to practice as a lawyer. He was supposed to live in Courfeyrac‚Äôs room, which was decent, and where a certain number of law-books backed up and completed by several dilapidated volumes of romance, passed as the library required by the regulations. He had his letters addressed to Courfeyrac‚Äôs quarters.
U||When Marius became a lawyer, he informed his grandfather of the fact in a letter which was cold but full of submission and respect. M. Gillenormand trembled as he took the letter, read it, tore it in four pieces, and threw it into the waste-basket. Two or three days later, Mademoiselle Gillenormand heard her father, who was alone in his room, talking aloud to himself. He always did this whenever he was greatly agitated. She listened, and the old man was saying: ‚ÄúIf you were not a fool, you would know that one cannot be a baron and a lawyer at the same time.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîMARIUS POOR
U||It is the same with wretchedness as with everything else. It ends by becoming bearable. It finally assumes a form, and adjusts itself. One vegetates, that is to say, one develops in a certain meagre fashion, which is, however, sufficient for life. This is the mode in which the existence of Marius Pontmercy was arranged:
U||He had passed the worst straits; the narrow pass was opening out a little in front of him. By dint of toil, perseverance, courage, and will, he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a year. He had learned German and English; thanks to Courfeyrac, who had put him in communication with his friend the publisher, Marius filled the modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishing house. He drew up prospectuses, translated newspapers, annotated editions, compiled biographies, etc.; net product, year in and year out, seven hundred francs. He lived on it. How? Not so badly. We will explain.
U||Marius occupied in the Gorbeau house, for an annual sum of thirty francs, a den minus a fireplace, called a cabinet, which contained only the most indispensable articles of furniture. This furniture belonged to him. He gave three francs a month to the old principal tenant to come and sweep his hole, and to bring him a little hot water every morning, a fresh egg, and a penny roll. He breakfasted on this egg and roll. His breakfast varied in cost from two to four sous, according as eggs were dear or cheap. At six o‚Äôclock in the evening he descended the Rue Saint-Jacques to dine at Rousseau‚Äôs, opposite Basset‚Äôs, the stamp-dealer‚Äôs, on the corner of the Rue des Mathurins. He ate no soup. He took a six-sou plate of meat, a half-portion of vegetables for three sous, and a three-sou dessert. For three sous he got as much bread as he wished. As for wine, he drank water. When he paid at the desk where Madam Rousseau, at that period still plump and rosy majestically presided, he gave a sou to the waiter, and M
U||adam Rousseau gave him a smile. Then he went away. For sixteen sous he had a smile and a dinner.
U||This Restaurant Rousseau, where so few bottles and so many water carafes were emptied, was a calming potion rather than a restaurant. It no longer exists. The proprietor had a fine nickname: he was called Rousseau the Aquatic.
U||Thus, breakfast four sous, dinner sixteen sous; his food cost him twenty sous a day; which made three hundred and sixty-five francs a year. Add the thirty francs for rent, and the thirty-six francs to the old woman, plus a few trifling expenses; for four hundred and fifty francs, Marius was fed, lodged, and waited on. His clothing cost him a hundred francs, his linen fifty francs, his washing fifty francs; the whole did not exceed six hundred and fifty francs. He was rich. He sometimes lent ten francs to a friend. Courfeyrac had once been able to borrow sixty francs of him. As far as fire was concerned, as Marius had no fireplace, he had ‚Äúsimplified matters.‚Äù
U||Marius always had two complete suits of clothes, the one old, ‚Äúfor every day‚Äù; the other, brand new for special occasions. Both were black. He had but three shirts, one on his person, the second in the commode, and the third in the washerwoman‚Äôs hands. He renewed them as they wore out. They were always ragged, which caused him to button his coat to the chin.
U||It had required years for Marius to attain to this flourishing condition. Hard years; difficult, some of them, to traverse, others to climb. Marius had not failed for a single day. He had endured everything in the way of destitution; he had done everything except contract debts. He did himself the justice to say that he had never owed any one a sou. A debt was, to him, the beginning of slavery. He even said to himself, that a creditor is worse than a master; for the master possesses only your person, a creditor possesses your dignity and can administer to it a box on the ear. Rather than borrow, he went without food. He had passed many a day fasting. Feeling that all extremes meet, and that, if one is not on one‚Äôs guard, lowered fortunes may lead to baseness of soul, he kept a jealous watch on his pride. Such and such a formality or action, which, in any other situation would have appeared merely a deference to him, now seemed insipidity, and he nerved himself against it. His face wore a sort of severe flu
U||sh. He was timid even to rudeness.
U||During all these trials he had felt himself encouraged and even uplifted, at times, by a secret force that he possessed within himself. The soul aids the body, and at certain moments, raises it. It is the only bird which bears up its own cage.
U||Besides his father‚Äôs name, another name was graven in Marius‚Äô heart, the name of Th√©nardier. Marius, with his grave and enthusiastic nature, surrounded with a sort of aureole the man to whom, in his thoughts, he owed his father‚Äôs life,‚Äîthat intrepid sergeant who had saved the colonel amid the bullets and the cannon-balls of Waterloo. He never separated the memory of this man from the memory of his father, and he associated them in his veneration. It was a sort of worship in two steps, with the grand altar for the colonel and the lesser one for Th√©nardier. What redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards Th√©nardier, was the idea of the distress into which he knew that Th√©nardier had fallen, and which had engulfed the latter. Marius had learned at Montfermeil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the unfortunate inn-keeper. Since that time, he had made unheard-of efforts to find traces of him and to reach him in that dark abyss of misery in which Th√©nardier had disappeared. Marius had beaten the who
U||le country; he had gone to Chelles, to Bondy, to Gourney, to Nogent, to Lagny. He had persisted for three years, expending in these explorations the little money which he had laid by. No one had been able to give him any news of Th√©nardier: he was supposed to have gone abroad. His creditors had also sought him, with less love than Marius, but with as much assiduity, and had not been able to lay their hands on him. Marius blamed himself, and was almost angry with himself for his lack of success in his researches. It was the only debt left him by the colonel, and Marius made it a matter of honor to pay it. ‚ÄúWhat,‚Äù he thought, ‚Äúwhen my father lay dying on the field of battle, did Th√©nardier contrive to find him amid the smoke and the grape-shot, and bear him off on his shoulders, and yet he owed him nothing, and I, who owe so much to Th√©nardier, cannot join him in this shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death, and in my turn bring him back from death to life! Oh! I will find him!‚Äù To find Th√©n
U||ardier, in fact, Marius would have given one of his arms, to rescue him from his misery, he would have sacrificed all his blood. To see Th√©nardier, to render Th√©nardier some service, to say to him: ‚ÄúYou do not know me; well, I do know you! Here I am. Dispose of me!‚Äù This was Marius‚Äô sweetest and most magnificent dream.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîMARIUS GROWN UP
U||At this epoch, Marius was twenty years of age. It was three years since he had left his grandfather. Both parties had remained on the same terms, without attempting to approach each other, and without seeking to see each other. Besides, what was the use of seeing each other? Marius was the brass vase, while Father Gillenormand was the iron pot.
U||We admit that Marius was mistaken as to his grandfather‚Äôs heart. He had imagined that M. Gillenormand had never loved him, and that that crusty, harsh, and smiling old fellow who cursed, shouted, and stormed and brandished his cane, cherished for him, at the most, only that affection, which is at once slight and severe, of the dotards of comedy. Marius was in error. There are fathers who do not love their children; there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson. At bottom, as we have said, M. Gillenormand idolized Marius. He idolized him after his own fashion, with an accompaniment of snappishness and boxes on the ear; but, this child once gone, he felt a black void in his heart; he would allow no one to mention the child to him, and all the while secretly regretted that he was so well obeyed. At first, he hoped that this Buonapartist, this Jacobin, this terrorist, this Septembrist, would return. But the weeks passed by, years passed; to M. Gillenormand‚Äôs great despair, the ‚Äúblood-drinker‚
U||Äù did not make his appearance. ‚ÄúI could not do otherwise than turn him out,‚Äù said the grandfather to himself, and he asked himself: ‚ÄúIf the thing were to do over again, would I do it?‚Äù His pride instantly answered ‚Äúyes,‚Äù but his aged head, which he shook in silence, replied sadly ‚Äúno.‚Äù He had his hours of depression. He missed Marius. Old men need affection as they need the sun. It is warmth. Strong as his nature was, the absence of Marius had wrought some change in him. Nothing in the world could have induced him to take a step towards ‚Äúthat rogue‚Äù; but he suffered. He never inquired about him, but he thought of him incessantly. He lived in the Marais in a more and more retired manner; he was still merry and violent as of old, but his merriment had a convulsive harshness, and his violences always terminated in a sort of gentle and gloomy dejection. He sometimes said: ‚ÄúOh! if he only would return, what a good box on the ear I would give him!‚Äù
U||As for his aunt, she thought too little to love much; Marius was no longer for her much more than a vague black form; and she eventually came to occupy herself with him much less than with the cat or the paroquet which she probably had. What augmented Father Gillenormand‚Äôs secret suffering was, that he locked it all up within his breast, and did not allow its existence to be divined. His sorrow was like those recently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke. It sometimes happened that officious busybodies spoke to him of Marius, and asked him: ‚ÄúWhat is your grandson doing?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat has become of him?‚Äù The old bourgeois replied with a sigh, that he was a sad case, and giving a fillip to his cuff, if he wished to appear gay: ‚ÄúMonsieur le Baron de Pontmercy is practising pettifogging in some corner or other.‚Äù
U||While the old man regretted, Marius applauded himself. As is the case with all good-hearted people, misfortune had eradicated his bitterness. He only thought of M. Gillenormand in an amiable light, but he had set his mind on not receiving anything more from the man who had been unkind to his father. This was the mitigated translation of his first indignation. Moreover, he was happy at having suffered, and at suffering still. It was for his father‚Äôs sake. The hardness of his life satisfied and pleased him. He said to himself with a sort of joy that‚Äî it was certainly the least he could do; that it was an expiation;‚Äîthat, had it not been for that, he would have been punished in some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his father, and such a father! that it would not have been just that his father should have all the suffering, and he none of it; and that, in any case, what were his toils and his destitution compared with the colonel‚Äôs heroic life? that, in short, the only way for
U|| him to approach his father and resemble him, was to be brave in the face of indigence, as the other had been valiant before the enemy; and that that was, no doubt, what the colonel had meant to imply by the words: ‚ÄúHe will be worthy of it.‚Äù Words which Marius continued to wear, not on his breast, since the colonel‚Äôs writing had disappeared, but in his heart.
U||And then, on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors, he had been only a child, now he was a man. He felt it. Misery, we repeat, had been good for him. Poverty in youth, when it succeeds, has this magnificent property about it, that it turns the whole will towards effort, and the whole soul towards aspiration. Poverty instantly lays material life bare and renders it hideous; hence inexpressible bounds towards the ideal life. The wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and brilliant distractions, horse races, hunting, dogs, tobacco, gaming, good repasts, and all the rest of it; occupations for the baser side of the soul, at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides. The poor young man wins his bread with difficulty; he eats; when he has eaten, he has nothing more but meditation. He goes to the spectacles which God furnishes gratis; he gazes at the sky, space, the stars, flowers, children, the humanity among which he is suffering, the creation amid which he beams. He gazes so much on h
U||umanity that he perceives its soul, he gazes upon creation to such an extent that he beholds God. He dreams, he feels himself great; he dreams on, and feels himself tender. From the egotism of the man who suffers he passes to the compassion of the man who meditates. An admirable sentiment breaks forth in him, forgetfulness of self and pity for all. As he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments which nature offers, gives, and lavishes to souls which stand open, and refuses to souls that are closed, he comes to pity, he the millionnaire of the mind, the millionnaire of money. All hatred departs from his heart, in proportion as light penetrates his spirit. And is he unhappy? No. The misery of a young man is never miserable. The first young lad who comes to hand, however poor he may be, with his strength, his health, his rapid walk, his brilliant eyes, his warmly circulating blood, his black hair, his red lips, his white teeth, his pure breath, will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor. And then, every morning
U||, he sets himself afresh to the task of earning his bread; and while his hands earn his bread, his dorsal column gains pride, his brain gathers ideas. His task finished, he returns to ineffable ecstasies, to contemplation, to joys; he beholds his feet set in afflictions, in obstacles, on the pavement, in the nettles, sometimes in the mire; his head in the light. He is firm, serene, gentle, peaceful, attentive, serious, content with little, kindly; and he thanks God for having bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many a rich man lacks: work, which makes him free; and thought, which makes him dignified.
U||This is what had happened with Marius. To tell the truth, he inclined a little too much to the side of contemplation. From the day when he had succeeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty, he had stopped, thinking it good to be poor, and retrenching time from his work to give to thought; that is to say, he sometimes passed entire days in meditation, absorbed, engulfed, like a visionary, in the mute voluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance. He had thus propounded the problem of his life: to toil as little as possible at material labor, in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is impalpable; in other words, to bestow a few hours on real life, and to cast the rest to the infinite. As he believed that he lacked nothing, he did not perceive that contemplation, thus understood, ends by becoming one of the forms of idleness; that he was contenting himself with conquering the first necessities of life, and that he was resting from his labors too soon.
U||It was evident that, for this energetic and enthusiastic nature, this could only be a transitory state, and that, at the first shock against the inevitable complications of destiny, Marius would awaken.
U||In the meantime, although he was a lawyer, and whatever Father Gillenormand thought about the matter, he was not practising, he was not even pettifogging. Meditation had turned him aside from pleading. To haunt attorneys, to follow the court, to hunt up cases‚Äîwhat a bore! Why should he do it? He saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining his livelihood! The obscure and ill-paid publishing establishment had come to mean for him a sure source of work which did not involve too much labor, as we have explained, and which sufficed for his wants.
U||One of the publishers for whom he worked, M. Magimel, I think, offered to take him into his own house, to lodge him well, to furnish him with regular occupation, and to give him fifteen hundred francs a year. To be well lodged! Fifteen hundred francs! No doubt. But renounce his liberty! Be on fixed wages! A sort of hired man of letters! According to Marius‚Äô opinion, if he accepted, his position would become both better and worse at the same time, he acquired comfort, and lost his dignity; it was a fine and complete unhappiness converted into a repulsive and ridiculous state of torture: something like the case of a blind man who should recover the sight of one eye. He refused.
U||Marius dwelt in solitude. Owing to his taste for remaining outside of everything, and through having been too much alarmed, he had not entered decidedly into the group presided over by Enjolras. They had remained good friends; they were ready to assist each other on occasion in every possible way; but nothing more. Marius had two friends: one young, Courfeyrac; and one old, M. Mabeuf. He inclined more to the old man. In the first place, he owed to him the revolution which had taken place within him; to him he was indebted for having known and loved his father. ‚ÄúHe operated on me for a cataract,‚Äù he said.
U||The churchwarden had certainly played a decisive part.
U||It was not, however, that M. Mabeuf had been anything but the calm and impassive agent of Providence in this connection. He had enlightened Marius by chance and without being aware of the fact, as does a candle which some one brings; he had been the candle and not the some one.
U||As for Marius‚Äô inward political revolution, M. Mabeuf was totally incapable of comprehending it, of willing or of directing it.
U||As we shall see M. Mabeuf again, later on, a few words will not be superfluous.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîM. MABEUF
U||On the day when M. Mabeuf said to Marius: ‚ÄúCertainly I approve of political opinions,‚Äù he expressed the real state of his mind. All political opinions were matters of indifference to him, and he approved them all, without distinction, provided they left him in peace, as the Greeks called the Furies ‚Äúthe beautiful, the good, the charming,‚Äù the Eumenides. M. Mabeuf‚Äôs political opinion consisted in a passionate love for plants, and, above all, for books. Like all the rest of the world, he possessed the termination in ist, without which no one could exist at that time, but he was neither a Royalist, a Bonapartist, a Chartist, an Orleanist, nor an Anarchist; he was a bouquinist, a collector of old books. He did not understand how men could busy themselves with hating each other because of silly stuff like the charter, democracy, legitimacy, monarchy, the republic, etc., when there were in the world all sorts of mosses, grasses, and shrubs which they might be looking at, and heaps of folios, and even of 
U||32mos, which they might turn over. He took good care not to become useless; having books did not prevent his reading, being a botanist did not prevent his being a gardener. When he made Pontmercy‚Äôs acquaintance, this sympathy had existed between the colonel and himself‚Äîthat what the colonel did for flowers, he did for fruits. M. Mabeuf had succeeded in producing seedling pears as savory as the pears of St. Germain; it is from one of his combinations, apparently, that the October Mirabelle, now celebrated and no less perfumed than the summer Mirabelle, owes its origin. He went to mass rather from gentleness than from piety, and because, as he loved the faces of men, but hated their noise, he found them assembled and silent only in church. Feeling that he must be something in the State, he had chosen the career of warden. However, he had never succeeded in loving any woman as much as a tulip bulb, nor any man as much as an Elzevir. He had long passed sixty, when, one day, some one asked him: ‚ÄúHave you ne
U||ver been married?‚Äù ‚ÄúI have forgotten,‚Äù said he. When it sometimes happened to him‚Äîand to whom does it not happen?‚Äîto say: ‚ÄúOh! if I were only rich!‚Äù it was not when ogling a pretty girl, as was the case with Father Gillenormand, but when contemplating an old book. He lived alone with an old housekeeper. He was somewhat gouty, and when he was asleep, his aged fingers, stiffened with rheumatism, lay crooked up in the folds of his sheets. He had composed and published a Flora of the Environs of Cauteretz, with colored plates, a work which enjoyed a tolerable measure of esteem and which sold well. People rang his bell, in the Rue M√©si√®res, two or three times a day, to ask for it. He drew as much as two thousand francs a year from it; this constituted nearly the whole of his fortune. Although poor, he had had the talent to form for himself, by dint of patience, privations, and time, a precious collection of rare copies of every sort. He never went out without a book under his arm, and he often ret
U||urned with two. The sole decoration of the four rooms on the ground floor, which composed his lodgings, consisted of framed herbariums, and engravings of the old masters. The sight of a sword or a gun chilled his blood. He had never approached a cannon in his life, even at the Invalides. He had a passable stomach, a brother who was a cur√©, perfectly white hair, no teeth, either in his mouth or his mind, a trembling in every limb, a Picard accent, an infantile laugh, the air of an old sheep, and he was easily frightened. Add to this, that he had no other friendship, no other acquaintance among the living, than an old bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques, named Royal. His dream was to naturalize indigo in France.
U||His servant was also a sort of innocent. The poor good old woman was a spinster. Sultan, her cat, which might have mewed Allegri‚Äôs miserere in the Sixtine Chapel, had filled her heart and sufficed for the quantity of passion which existed in her. None of her dreams had ever proceeded as far as man. She had never been able to get further than her cat. Like him, she had a moustache. Her glory consisted in her caps, which were always white. She passed her time, on Sundays, after mass, in counting over the linen in her chest, and in spreading out on her bed the dresses in the piece which she bought and never had made up. She knew how to read. M. Mabeuf had nicknamed her Mother Plutarque.
U||M. Mabeuf had taken a fancy to Marius, because Marius, being young and gentle, warmed his age without startling his timidity. Youth combined with gentleness produces on old people the effect of the sun without wind. When Marius was saturated with military glory, with gunpowder, with marches and countermarches, and with all those prodigious battles in which his father had given and received such tremendous blows of the sword, he went to see M. Mabeuf, and M. Mabeuf talked to him of his hero from the point of view of flowers.
U||His brother the cur√© died about 1830, and almost immediately, as when the night is drawing on, the whole horizon grew dark for M. Mabeuf. A notary‚Äôs failure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs, which was all that he possessed in his brother‚Äôs right and his own. The Revolution of July brought a crisis to publishing. In a period of embarrassment, the first thing which does not sell is a Flora. The Flora of the Environs of Cauteretz stopped short. Weeks passed by without a single purchaser. Sometimes M. Mabeuf started at the sound of the bell. ‚ÄúMonsieur,‚Äù said Mother Plutarque sadly, ‚Äúit is the water-carrier.‚Äù In short, one day, M. Mabeuf quitted the Rue M√©si√®res, abdicated the functions of warden, gave up Saint-Sulpice, sold not a part of his books, but of his prints,‚Äîthat to which he was the least attached,‚Äîand installed himself in a little house on the Rue Montparnasse, where, however, he remained but one quarter for two reasons: in the first place, the ground floor and the gard
U||en cost three hundred francs, and he dared not spend more than two hundred francs on his rent; in the second, being near Faton‚Äôs shooting-gallery, he could hear the pistol-shots; which was intolerable to him.
U||He carried off his Flora, his copper-plates, his herbariums, his portfolios, and his books, and established himself near the Salp√™tri√®re, in a sort of thatched cottage of the village of Austerlitz, where, for fifty crowns a year, he got three rooms and a garden enclosed by a hedge, and containing a well. He took advantage of this removal to sell off nearly all his furniture. On the day of his entrance into his new quarters, he was very gay, and drove the nails on which his engravings and herbariums were to hang, with his own hands, dug in his garden the rest of the day, and at night, perceiving that Mother Plutarque had a melancholy air, and was very thoughtful, he tapped her on the shoulder and said to her with a smile: ‚ÄúWe have the indigo!‚Äù
U||Only two visitors, the bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques and Marius, were admitted to view the thatched cottage at Austerlitz, a brawling name which was, to tell the truth, extremely disagreeable to him.
U||However, as we have just pointed out, brains which are absorbed in some bit of wisdom, or folly, or, as it often happens, in both at once, are but slowly accessible to the things of actual life. Their own destiny is a far-off thing to them. There results from such concentration a passivity, which, if it were the outcome of reasoning, would resemble philosophy. One declines, descends, trickles away, even crumbles away, and yet is hardly conscious of it one‚Äôs self. It always ends, it is true, in an awakening, but the awakening is tardy. In the meantime, it seems as though we held ourselves neutral in the game which is going on between our happiness and our unhappiness. We are the stake, and we look on at the game with indifference.
U||It is thus that, athwart the cloud which formed about him, when all his hopes were extinguished one after the other, M. Mabeuf remained rather puerilely, but profoundly serene. His habits of mind had the regular swing of a pendulum. Once mounted on an illusion, he went for a very long time, even after the illusion had disappeared. A clock does not stop short at the precise moment when the key is lost.
U||M. Mabeuf had his innocent pleasures. These pleasures were inexpensive and unexpected; the merest chance furnished them. One day, Mother Plutarque was reading a romance in one corner of the room. She was reading aloud, finding that she understood better thus. To read aloud is to assure one‚Äôs self of what one is reading. There are people who read very loud, and who have the appearance of giving themselves their word of honor as to what they are perusing.
U||It was with this sort of energy that Mother Plutarque was reading the romance which she had in hand. M. Mabeuf heard her without listening to her.
U||In the course of her reading, Mother Plutarque came to this phrase. It was a question of an officer of dragoons and a beauty:‚Äî
U||‚Äú‚ÄîThe beauty pouted, and the dragoon‚Äî‚Äù
U||Here she interrupted herself to wipe her glasses.
U||‚ÄúBouddha and the Dragon,‚Äù struck in M. Mabeuf in a low voice. ‚ÄúYes, it is true that there was a dragon, which, from the depths of its cave, spouted flame through his maw and set the heavens on fire. Many stars had already been consumed by this monster, which, besides, had the claws of a tiger. Bouddha went into its den and succeeded in converting the dragon. That is a good book that you are reading, Mother Plutarque. There is no more beautiful legend in existence.‚Äù
U||And M. Mabeuf fell into a delicious reverie.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîPOVERTY A GOOD NEIGHBOR FOR MISERY
U||Marius liked this candid old man who saw himself gradually falling into the clutches of indigence, and who came to feel astonishment, little by little, without, however, being made melancholy by it. Marius met Courfeyrac and sought out M. Mabeuf. Very rarely, however; twice a month at most.
U||Marius‚Äô pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outer boulevards, or in the Champs-de-Mars, or in the least frequented alleys of the Luxembourg. He often spent half a day in gazing at a market garden, the beds of lettuce, the chickens on the dung-heap, the horse turning the water-wheel. The passers-by stared at him in surprise, and some of them thought his attire suspicious and his mien sinister. He was only a poor young man dreaming in an objectless way.
U||It was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the Gorbeau house, and, tempted by its isolation and its cheapness, had taken up his abode there. He was known there only under the name of M. Marius.
U||Some of his father‚Äôs old generals or old comrades had invited him to go and see them, when they learned about him. Marius had not refused their invitations. They afforded opportunities of talking about his father. Thus he went from time to time, to Comte Pajol, to General Bellavesne, to General Fririon, to the Invalides. There was music and dancing there. On such evenings, Marius put on his new coat. But he never went to these evening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing cold, because he could not afford a carriage, and he did not wish to arrive with boots otherwise than like mirrors.
U||He said sometimes, but without bitterness: ‚ÄúMen are so made that in a drawing-room you may be soiled everywhere except on your shoes. In order to insure a good reception there, only one irreproachable thing is asked of you; your conscience? No, your boots.‚Äù
U||All passions except those of the heart are dissipated by reverie. Marius‚Äô political fevers vanished thus. The Revolution of 1830 assisted in the process, by satisfying and calming him. He remained the same, setting aside his fits of wrath. He still held the same opinions. Only, they had been tempered. To speak accurately, he had no longer any opinions, he had sympathies. To what party did he belong? To the party of humanity. Out of humanity he chose France; out of the Nation he chose the people; out of the people he chose the woman. It was to that point above all, that his pity was directed. Now he preferred an idea to a deed, a poet to a hero, and he admired a book like Job more than an event like Marengo. And then, when, after a day spent in meditation, he returned in the evening through the boulevards, and caught a glimpse through the branches of the trees of the fathomless space beyond, the nameless gleams, the abyss, the shadow, the mystery, all that which is only human seemed very pretty indeed to hi
U||m.
U||He thought that he had, and he really had, in fact, arrived at the truth of life and of human philosophy, and he had ended by gazing at nothing but heaven, the only thing which Truth can perceive from the bottom of her well.
U||This did not prevent him from multiplying his plans, his combinations, his scaffoldings, his projects for the future. In this state of reverie, an eye which could have cast a glance into Marius‚Äô interior would have been dazzled with the purity of that soul. In fact, had it been given to our eyes of the flesh to gaze into the consciences of others, we should be able to judge a man much more surely according to what he dreams, than according to what he thinks. There is will in thought, there is none in dreams. Reverie, which is utterly spontaneous, takes and keeps, even in the gigantic and the ideal, the form of our spirit. Nothing proceeds more directly and more sincerely from the very depth of our soul, than our unpremeditated and boundless aspirations towards the splendors of destiny. In these aspirations, much more than in deliberate, rational co-ordinated ideas, is the real character of a man to be found. Our chim√¶ras are the things which the most resemble us. Each one of us dreams of the unknown and t
U||he impossible in accordance with his nature.
U||Towards the middle of this year 1831, the old woman who waited on Marius told him that his neighbors, the wretched Jondrette family, had been turned out of doors. Marius, who passed nearly the whole of his days out of the house, hardly knew that he had any neighbors.
U||‚ÄúWhy are they turned out?‚Äù he asked.
U||‚ÄúBecause they do not pay their rent; they owe for two quarters.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHow much is it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTwenty francs,‚Äù said the old woman.
U||Marius had thirty francs saved up in a drawer.
U||‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he said to the old woman, ‚Äútake these twenty-five francs. Pay for the poor people and give them five francs, and do not tell them that it was I.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîTHE SUBSTITUTE
U||It chanced that the regiment to which Lieutenant Th√©odule belonged came to perform garrison duty in Paris. This inspired Aunt Gillenormand with a second idea. She had, on the first occasion, hit upon the plan of having Marius spied upon by Th√©odule; now she plotted to have Th√©odule take Marius‚Äô place.
U||At all events and in case the grandfather should feel the vague need of a young face in the house,‚Äîthese rays of dawn are sometimes sweet to ruin,‚Äîit was expedient to find another Marius. ‚ÄúTake it as a simple erratum,‚Äù she thought, ‚Äúsuch as one sees in books. For Marius, read Th√©odule.‚Äù
U||A grandnephew is almost the same as a grandson; in default of a lawyer one takes a lancer.
U||One morning, when M. Gillenormand was about to read something in the Quotidienne, his daughter entered and said to him in her sweetest voice; for the question concerned her favorite:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFather, Th√©odule is coming to present his respects to you this morning.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Th√©odule?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYour grandnephew.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù said the grandfather.
U||Then he went back to his reading, thought no more of his grandnephew, who was merely some Th√©odule or other, and soon flew into a rage, which almost always happened when he read. The ‚Äúsheet‚Äù which he held, although Royalist, of course, announced for the following day, without any softening phrases, one of these little events which were of daily occurrence at that date in Paris: ‚ÄúThat the students of the schools of law and medicine were to assemble on the Place du Panth√©on, at midday,‚Äîto deliberate.‚Äù The discussion concerned one of the questions of the moment, the artillery of the National Guard, and a conflict between the Minister of War and ‚Äúthe citizen‚Äôs militia,‚Äù on the subject of the cannon parked in the courtyard of the Louvre. The students were to ‚Äúdeliberate‚Äù over this. It did not take much more than this to swell M. Gillenormand‚Äôs rage.
U||He thought of Marius, who was a student, and who would probably go with the rest, to ‚Äúdeliberate, at midday, on the Place du Panth√©on.‚Äù
U||As he was indulging in this painful dream, Lieutenant Th√©odule entered clad in plain clothes as a bourgeois, which was clever of him, and was discreetly introduced by Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The lancer had reasoned as follows: ‚ÄúThe old druid has not sunk all his money in a life pension. It is well to disguise one‚Äôs self as a civilian from time to time.‚Äù
U||Mademoiselle Gillenormand said aloud to her father:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúTh√©odule, your grandnephew.‚Äù
U||And in a low voice to the lieutenant:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúApprove of everything.‚Äù
U||And she withdrew.
U||The lieutenant, who was but little accustomed to such venerable encounters, stammered with some timidity: ‚ÄúGood day, uncle,‚Äù‚Äîand made a salute composed of the involuntary and mechanical outline of the military salute finished off as a bourgeois salute.
U||‚ÄúAh! so it‚Äôs you; that is well, sit down,‚Äù said the old gentleman.
U||That said, he totally forgot the lancer.
U||Th√©odule seated himself, and M. Gillenormand rose.
U||M. Gillenormand began to pace back and forth, his hands in his pockets, talking aloud, and twitching, with his irritated old fingers, at the two watches which he wore in his two fobs.
U||‚ÄúThat pack of brats! they convene on the Place du Panth√©on! by my life! urchins who were with their nurses but yesterday! If one were to squeeze their noses, milk would burst out. And they deliberate to-morrow, at midday. What are we coming to? What are we coming to? It is clear that we are making for the abyss. That is what the descamisados have brought us to! To deliberate on the citizen artillery! To go and jabber in the open air over the jibes of the National Guard! And with whom are they to meet there? Just see whither Jacobinism leads. I will bet anything you like, a million against a counter, that there will be no one there but returned convicts and released galley-slaves. The Republicans and the galley-slaves,‚Äîthey form but one nose and one handkerchief. Carnot used to say: ‚ÄòWhere would you have me go, traitor?‚Äô Fouch√© replied: ‚ÄòWherever you please, imbecile!‚Äô That‚Äôs what the Republicans are like.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is true,‚Äù said Th√©odule.
U||M. Gillenormand half turned his head, saw Th√©odule, and went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhen one reflects that that scoundrel was so vile as to turn carbonaro! Why did you leave my house? To go and become a Republican! Pssst! In the first place, the people want none of your republic, they have common sense, they know well that there always have been kings, and that there always will be; they know well that the people are only the people, after all, they make sport of it, of your republic‚Äîdo you understand, idiot? Is it not a horrible caprice? To fall in love with P√®re Duchesne, to make sheep‚Äôs-eyes at the guillotine, to sing romances, and play on the guitar under the balcony of ‚Äô93‚Äîit‚Äôs enough to make one spit on all these young fellows, such fools are they! They are all alike. Not one escapes. It suffices for them to breathe the air which blows through the street to lose their senses. The nineteenth century is poison. The first scamp that happens along lets his beard grow like a goat‚Äôs, thinks himself a real scoundrel, and abandons his old relatives. He‚Äôs a Republican, he‚Äôs
U|| a romantic. What does that mean, romantic? Do me the favor to tell me what it is. All possible follies. A year ago, they ran to Hernani. Now, I just ask you, Hernani! antitheses! abominations which are not even written in French! And then, they have cannons in the courtyard of the Louvre. Such are the rascalities of this age!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are right, uncle,‚Äù said Th√©odule.
U||M. Gillenormand resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCannons in the courtyard of the Museum! For what purpose? Do you want to fire grape-shot at the Apollo Belvedere? What have those cartridges to do with the Venus de Medici? Oh! the young men of the present day are all blackguards! What a pretty creature is their Benjamin Constant! And those who are not rascals are simpletons! They do all they can to make themselves ugly, they are badly dressed, they are afraid of women, in the presence of petticoats they have a mendicant air which sets the girls into fits of laughter; on my word of honor, one would say the poor creatures were ashamed of love. They are deformed, and they complete themselves by being stupid; they repeat the puns of Tiercelin and Potier, they have sack coats, stablemen‚Äôs waistcoats, shirts of coarse linen, trousers of coarse cloth, boots of coarse leather, and their rigmarole resembles their plumage. One might make use of their jargon to put new soles on their old shoes. And all this awkward batch of brats has political opinions, if you pl
U||ease. Political opinions should be strictly forbidden. They fabricate systems, they recast society, they demolish the monarchy, they fling all laws to the earth, they put the attic in the cellar‚Äôs place and my porter in the place of the King, they turn Europe topsy-turvy, they reconstruct the world, and all their love affairs consist in staring slily at the ankles of the laundresses as these women climb into their carts. Ah! Marius! Ah! you blackguard! to go and vociferate on the public place! to discuss, to debate, to take measures! They call that measures, just God! Disorder humbles itself and becomes silly. I have seen chaos, I now see a mess. Students deliberating on the National Guard,‚Äîsuch a thing could not be seen among the Ogibewas nor the Cadodaches! Savages who go naked, with their noddles dressed like a shuttlecock, with a club in their paws, are less of brutes than those bachelors of arts! The four-penny monkeys! And they set up for judges! Those creatures deliberate and ratiocinate! The end 
U||of the world is come! This is plainly the end of this miserable terraqueous globe! A final hiccough was required, and France has emitted it. Deliberate, my rascals! Such things will happen so long as they go and read the newspapers under the arcades of the Od√©on. That costs them a sou, and their good sense, and their intelligence, and their heart and their soul, and their wits. They emerge thence, and decamp from their families. All newspapers are pests; all, even the Drapeau Blanc! At bottom, Martainville was a Jacobin. Ah! just Heaven! you may boast of having driven your grandfather to despair, that you may!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is evident,‚Äù said Th√©odule.
U||And profiting by the fact that M. Gillenormand was taking breath, the lancer added in a magisterial manner:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThere should be no other newspaper than the Moniteur, and no other book than the Annuaire Militaire.‚Äù
U||M. Gillenormand continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt is like their Siey√®s! A regicide ending in a senator; for that is the way they always end. They give themselves a scar with the address of thou as citizens, in order to get themselves called, eventually, Monsieur le Comte. Monsieur le Comte as big as my arm, assassins of September. The philosopher Siey√®s! I will do myself the justice to say, that I have never had any better opinion of the philosophies of all those philosophers, than of the spectacles of the grimacer of Tivoli! One day I saw the Senators cross the Quai Malplaquet in mantles of violet velvet sown with bees, with hats √† la Henri IV. They were hideous. One would have pronounced them monkeys from the tiger‚Äôs court. Citizens, I declare to you, that your progress is madness, that your humanity is a dream, that your revolution is a crime, that your republic is a monster, that your young and virgin France comes from the brothel, and I maintain it against all, whoever you may be, whether journalists, economists, legists, or even were you be
U||tter judges of liberty, of equality, and fraternity than the knife of the guillotine! And that I announce to you, my fine fellows!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúParbleu!‚Äù cried the lieutenant, ‚Äúthat is wonderfully true.‚Äù
U||M. Gillenormand paused in a gesture which he had begun, wheeled round, stared Lancer Th√©odule intently in the eyes, and said to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou are a fool.‚Äù
U||BOOK SIXTH‚ÄîTHE CONJUNCTION OF TWO STARS
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîTHE SOBRIQUET: MODE OF FORMATION OF FAMILY NAMES
U||Marius was, at this epoch, a handsome young man, of medium stature, with thick and intensely black hair, a lofty and intelligent brow, well-opened and passionate nostrils, an air of calmness and sincerity, and with something indescribably proud, thoughtful, and innocent over his whole countenance. His profile, all of whose lines were rounded, without thereby losing their firmness, had a certain Germanic sweetness, which has made its way into the French physiognomy by way of Alsace and Lorraine, and that complete absence of angles which rendered the Sicambres so easily recognizable among the Romans, and which distinguishes the leonine from the aquiline race. He was at that period of life when the mind of men who think is composed, in nearly equal parts, of depth and ingenuousness. A grave situation being given, he had all that is required to be stupid: one more turn of the key, and he might be sublime. His manners were reserved, cold, polished, not very genial. As his mouth was charming, his lips the reddest,
U|| and his teeth the whitest in the world, his smile corrected the severity of his face, as a whole. At certain moments, that pure brow and that voluptuous smile presented a singular contrast. His eyes were small, but his glance was large.
U||At the period of his most abject misery, he had observed that young girls turned round when he passed by, and he fled or hid, with death in his soul. He thought that they were staring at him because of his old clothes, and that they were laughing at them; the fact is, that they stared at him because of his grace, and that they dreamed of him.
U||This mute misunderstanding between him and the pretty passers-by had made him shy. He chose none of them for the excellent reason that he fled from all of them. He lived thus indefinitely,‚Äîstupidly, as Courfeyrac said.
U||Courfeyrac also said to him: ‚ÄúDo not aspire to be venerable‚Äù [they called each other thou; it is the tendency of youthful friendships to slip into this mode of address]. ‚ÄúLet me give you a piece of advice, my dear fellow. Don‚Äôt read so many books, and look a little more at the lasses. The jades have some good points about them, O Marius! By dint of fleeing and blushing, you will become brutalized.‚Äù
U||On other occasions, Courfeyrac encountered him and said:‚Äî‚ÄúGood morning, Monsieur l‚ÄôAbb√©!‚Äù
U||When Courfeyrac had addressed to him some remark of this nature, Marius avoided women, both young and old, more than ever for a week to come, and he avoided Courfeyrac to boot.
U||Nevertheless, there existed in all the immensity of creation, two women whom Marius did not flee, and to whom he paid no attention whatever. In truth, he would have been very much amazed if he had been informed that they were women. One was the bearded old woman who swept out his chamber, and caused Courfeyrac to say: ‚ÄúSeeing that his servant woman wears his beard, Marius does not wear his own beard.‚Äù The other was a sort of little girl whom he saw very often, and whom he never looked at.
U||For more than a year, Marius had noticed in one of the walks of the Luxembourg, the one which skirts the parapet of the P√©pini√®re, a man and a very young girl, who were almost always seated side by side on the same bench, at the most solitary end of the alley, on the Rue de l‚ÄôOuest side. Every time that that chance which meddles with the strolls of persons whose gaze is turned inwards, led Marius to that walk,‚Äîand it was nearly every day,‚Äîhe found this couple there. The man appeared to be about sixty years of age; he seemed sad and serious; his whole person presented the robust and weary aspect peculiar to military men who have retired from the service. If he had worn a decoration, Marius would have said: ‚ÄúHe is an ex-officer.‚Äù He had a kindly but unapproachable air, and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one. He wore blue trousers, a blue frock coat and a broad-brimmed hat, which always appeared to be new, a black cravat, a quaker shirt, that is to say, it was dazzlingly white, bu
U||t of coarse linen. A grisette who passed near him one day, said: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a very tidy widower.‚Äù His hair was very white.
U||The first time that the young girl who accompanied him came and seated herself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted, she was a sort of child thirteen or fourteen years of age, so thin as to be almost homely, awkward, insignificant, and with a possible promise of handsome eyes. Only, they were always raised with a sort of displeasing assurance. Her dress was both aged and childish, like the dress of the scholars in a convent; it consisted of a badly cut gown of black merino. They had the air of being father and daughter.
U||Marius scanned this old man, who was not yet aged, and this little girl, who was not yet a person, for a few days, and thereafter paid no attention to them. They, on their side, did not appear even to see him. They conversed together with a peaceful and indifferent air. The girl chattered incessantly and merrily. The old man talked but little, and, at times, he fixed on her eyes overflowing with an ineffable paternity.
U||Marius had acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk. He invariably found them there.
U||This is the way things went:‚Äî
U||Marius liked to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest from their bench; he walked the whole length of the alley, passed in front of them, then returned to the extremity whence he had come, and began again. This he did five or six times in the course of his promenade, and the promenade was taken five or six times a week, without its having occurred to him or to these people to exchange a greeting. That personage, and that young girl, although they appeared,‚Äîand perhaps because they appeared,‚Äîto shun all glances, had, naturally, caused some attention on the part of the five or six students who strolled along the P√©pini√®re from time to time; the studious after their lectures, the others after their game of billiards. Courfeyrac, who was among the last, had observed them several times, but, finding the girl homely, he had speedily and carefully kept out of the way. He had fled, discharging at them a sobriquet, like a Parthian dart. Impressed solely with the child‚Äôs gown and the old man‚Äôs ha
U||ir, he had dubbed the daughter Mademoiselle Lanoire, and the father, Monsieur Leblanc, so that as no one knew them under any other title, this nickname became a law in the default of any other name. The students said: ‚ÄúAh! Monsieur Leblanc is on his bench.‚Äù And Marius, like the rest, had found it convenient to call this unknown gentleman Monsieur Leblanc.
U||We shall follow their example, and we shall say M. Leblanc, in order to facilitate this tale.
U||So Marius saw them nearly every day, at the same hour, during the first year. He found the man to his taste, but the girl insipid.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîLUX FACTA EST
U||During the second year, precisely at the point in this history which the reader has now reached, it chanced that this habit of the Luxembourg was interrupted, without Marius himself being quite aware why, and nearly six months elapsed, during which he did not set foot in the alley. One day, at last, he returned thither once more; it was a serene summer morning, and Marius was in joyous mood, as one is when the weather is fine. It seemed to him that he had in his heart all the songs of the birds that he was listening to, and all the bits of blue sky of which he caught glimpses through the leaves of the trees.
U||He went straight to ‚Äúhis alley,‚Äù and when he reached the end of it he perceived, still on the same bench, that well-known couple. Only, when he approached, it certainly was the same man; but it seemed to him that it was no longer the same girl. The person whom he now beheld was a tall and beautiful creature, possessed of all the most charming lines of a woman at the precise moment when they are still combined with all the most ingenuous graces of the child; a pure and fugitive moment, which can be expressed only by these two words,‚Äî‚Äúfifteen years.‚Äù She had wonderful brown hair, shaded with threads of gold, a brow that seemed made of marble, cheeks that seemed made of rose-leaf, a pale flush, an agitated whiteness, an exquisite mouth, whence smiles darted like sunbeams, and words like music, a head such as Raphael would have given to Mary, set upon a neck that Jean Goujon would have attributed to a Venus. And, in order that nothing might be lacking to this bewitching face, her nose was not handsome‚
U||Äîit was pretty; neither straight nor curved, neither Italian nor Greek; it was the Parisian nose, that is to say, spiritual, delicate, irregular, pure,‚Äîwhich drives painters to despair, and charms poets.
U||When Marius passed near her, he could not see her eyes, which were constantly lowered. He saw only her long chestnut lashes, permeated with shadow and modesty.
U||This did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened to what the white-haired old man was saying to her, and nothing could be more fascinating than that fresh smile, combined with those drooping eyes.
U||For a moment, Marius thought that she was another daughter of the same man, a sister of the former, no doubt. But when the invariable habit of his stroll brought him, for the second time, near the bench, and he had examined her attentively, he recognized her as the same. In six months the little girl had become a young maiden; that was all. Nothing is more frequent than this phenomenon. There is a moment when girls blossom out in the twinkling of an eye, and become roses all at once. One left them children but yesterday; today, one finds them disquieting to the feelings.
U||This child had not only grown, she had become idealized. As three days in April suffice to cover certain trees with flowers, six months had sufficed to clothe her with beauty. Her April had arrived.
U||One sometimes sees people, who, poor and mean, seem to wake up, pass suddenly from indigence to luxury, indulge in expenditures of all sorts, and become dazzling, prodigal, magnificent, all of a sudden. That is the result of having pocketed an income; a note fell due yesterday. The young girl had received her quarterly income.
U||And then, she was no longer the school-girl with her felt hat, her merino gown, her scholar‚Äôs shoes, and red hands; taste had come to her with beauty; she was a well-dressed person, clad with a sort of rich and simple elegance, and without affectation. She wore a dress of black damask, a cape of the same material, and a bonnet of white crape. Her white gloves displayed the delicacy of the hand which toyed with the carved, Chinese ivory handle of a parasol, and her silken shoe outlined the smallness of her foot. When one passed near her, her whole toilette exhaled a youthful and penetrating perfume.
U||As for the man, he was the same as usual.
U||The second time that Marius approached her, the young girl raised her eyelids; her eyes were of a deep, celestial blue, but in that veiled azure, there was, as yet, nothing but the glance of a child. She looked at Marius indifferently, as she would have stared at the brat running beneath the sycamores, or the marble vase which cast a shadow on the bench, and Marius, on his side, continued his promenade, and thought about something else.
U||He passed near the bench where the young girl sat, five or six times, but without even turning his eyes in her direction.
U||On the following days, he returned, as was his wont, to the Luxembourg; as usual, he found there ‚Äúthe father and daughter;‚Äù but he paid no further attention to them. He thought no more about the girl now that she was beautiful than he had when she was homely. He passed very near the bench where she sat, because such was his habit.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîEFFECT OF THE SPRING
U||One day, the air was warm, the Luxembourg was inundated with light and shade, the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it that morning, the sparrows were giving vent to little twitters in the depths of the chestnut-trees. Marius had thrown open his whole soul to nature, he was not thinking of anything, he simply lived and breathed, he passed near the bench, the young girl raised her eyes to him, the two glances met.
U||What was there in the young girl‚Äôs glance on this occasion? Marius could not have told. There was nothing and there was everything. It was a strange flash.
U||She dropped her eyes, and he pursued his way.
U||What he had just seen was no longer the ingenuous and simple eye of a child; it was a mysterious gulf which had half opened, then abruptly closed again.
U||There comes a day when the young girl glances in this manner. Woe to him who chances to be there!
U||That first gaze of a soul which does not, as yet, know itself, is like the dawn in the sky. It is the awakening of something radiant and strange. Nothing can give any idea of the dangerous charm of that unexpected gleam, which flashes suddenly and vaguely forth from adorable shadows, and which is composed of all the innocence of the present, and of all the passion of the future. It is a sort of undecided tenderness which reveals itself by chance, and which waits. It is a snare which the innocent maiden sets unknown to herself, and in which she captures hearts without either wishing or knowing it. It is a virgin looking like a woman.
U||It is rare that a profound reverie does not spring from that glance, where it falls. All purities and all candors meet in that celestial and fatal gleam which, more than all the best-planned tender glances of coquettes, possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming, in the depths of the soul, of that sombre flower, impregnated with perfume and with poison, which is called love.
U||That evening, on his return to his garret, Marius cast his eyes over his garments, and perceived, for the first time, that he had been so slovenly, indecorous, and inconceivably stupid as to go for his walk in the Luxembourg with his ‚Äúevery-day clothes,‚Äù that is to say, with a hat battered near the band, coarse carter‚Äôs boots, black trousers which showed white at the knees, and a black coat which was pale at the elbows.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîBEGINNING OF A GREAT MALADY
U||On the following day, at the accustomed hour, Marius drew from his wardrobe his new coat, his new trousers, his new hat, and his new boots; he clothed himself in this complete panoply, put on his gloves, a tremendous luxury, and set off for the Luxembourg.
U||On the way thither, he encountered Courfeyrac, and pretended not to see him. Courfeyrac, on his return home, said to his friends:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI have just met Marius‚Äô new hat and new coat, with Marius inside them. He was going to pass an examination, no doubt. He looked utterly stupid.‚Äù
U||On arriving at the Luxembourg, Marius made the tour of the fountain basin, and stared at the swans; then he remained for a long time in contemplation before a statue whose head was perfectly black with mould, and one of whose hips was missing. Near the basin there was a bourgeois forty years of age, with a prominent stomach, who was holding by the hand a little urchin of five, and saying to him: ‚ÄúShun excess, my son, keep at an equal distance from despotism and from anarchy.‚Äù Marius listened to this bourgeois. Then he made the circuit of the basin once more. At last he directed his course towards ‚Äúhis alley,‚Äù slowly, and as if with regret. One would have said that he was both forced to go there and withheld from doing so. He did not perceive it himself, and thought that he was doing as he always did.
U||On turning into the walk, he saw M. Leblanc and the young girl at the other end, ‚Äúon their bench.‚Äù He buttoned his coat up to the very top, pulled it down on his body so that there might be no wrinkles, examined, with a certain complaisance, the lustrous gleams of his trousers, and marched on the bench. This march savored of an attack, and certainly of a desire for conquest. So I say that he marched on the bench, as I should say: ‚ÄúHannibal marched on Rome.‚Äù
U||However, all his movements were purely mechanical, and he had interrupted none of the habitual preoccupations of his mind and labors. At that moment, he was thinking that the Manuel du Baccalaur√©at was a stupid book, and that it must have been drawn up by rare idiots, to allow of three tragedies of Racine and only one comedy of Moli√®re being analyzed therein as masterpieces of the human mind. There was a piercing whistling going on in his ears. As he approached the bench, he held fast to the folds in his coat, and fixed his eyes on the young girl. It seemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the alley with a vague blue light.
U||In proportion as he drew near, his pace slackened more and more. On arriving at some little distance from the bench, and long before he had reached the end of the walk, he halted, and could not explain to himself why he retraced his steps. He did not even say to himself that he would not go as far as the end. It was only with difficulty that the young girl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine appearance in his new clothes. Nevertheless, he held himself very erect, in case any one should be looking at him from behind.
U||He attained the opposite end, then came back, and this time he approached a little nearer to the bench. He even got to within three intervals of trees, but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of proceeding further, and he hesitated. He thought he saw the young girl‚Äôs face bending towards him. But he exerted a manly and violent effort, subdued his hesitation, and walked straight ahead. A few seconds later, he rushed in front of the bench, erect and firm, reddening to the very ears, without daring to cast a glance either to the right or to the left, with his hand thrust into his coat like a statesman. At the moment when he passed,‚Äîunder the cannon of the place,‚Äîhe felt his heart beat wildly. As on the preceding day, she wore her damask gown and her crape bonnet. He heard an ineffable voice, which must have been ‚Äúher voice.‚Äù She was talking tranquilly. She was very pretty. He felt it, although he made no attempt to see her. ‚ÄúShe could not, however,‚Äù he thought, ‚Äúhelp feeling esteem and 
U||consideration for me, if she only knew that I am the veritable author of the dissertation on Marcos Obr√©gon de la Ronde, which M. Fran√ßois de Neufch√¢teau put, as though it were his own, at the head of his edition of Gil Blas.‚Äù He went beyond the bench as far as the extremity of the walk, which was very near, then turned on his heel and passed once more in front of the lovely girl. This time, he was very pale. Moreover, all his emotions were disagreeable. As he went further from the bench and the young girl, and while his back was turned to her, he fancied that she was gazing after him, and that made him stumble.
U||He did not attempt to approach the bench again; he halted near the middle of the walk, and there, a thing which he never did, he sat down, and reflecting in the most profoundly indistinct depths of his spirit, that after all, it was hard that persons whose white bonnet and black gown he admired should be absolutely insensible to his splendid trousers and his new coat.
U||At the expiration of a quarter of an hour, he rose, as though he were on the point of again beginning his march towards that bench which was surrounded by an aureole. But he remained standing there, motionless. For the first time in fifteen months, he said to himself that that gentleman who sat there every day with his daughter, had, on his side, noticed him, and probably considered his assiduity singular.
U||For the first time, also, he was conscious of some irreverence in designating that stranger, even in his secret thoughts, by the sobriquet of M. Leblanc.
U||He stood thus for several minutes, with drooping head, tracing figures in the sand, with the cane which he held in his hand.
U||Then he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench, to M. Leblanc and his daughter, and went home.
U||That day he forgot to dine. At eight o‚Äôclock in the evening he perceived this fact, and as it was too late to go down to the Rue Saint-Jacques, he said: ‚ÄúNever mind!‚Äù and ate a bit of bread.
U||He did not go to bed until he had brushed his coat and folded it up with great care.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîDIVERS CLAPS OF THUNDER FALL ON MA‚ÄôAM BOUGON
U||On the following day, Ma‚Äôam Bougon, as Courfeyrac styled the old portress-principal-tenant, housekeeper of the Gorbeau hovel, Ma‚Äôam Bougon, whose name was, in reality, Madame Burgon, as we have found out, but this iconoclast, Courfeyrac, respected nothing,‚ÄîMa‚Äôam Bougon observed, with stupefaction, that M. Marius was going out again in his new coat.
U||He went to the Luxembourg again, but he did not proceed further than his bench midway of the alley. He seated himself there, as on the preceding day, surveying from a distance, and clearly making out, the white bonnet, the black dress, and above all, that blue light. He did not stir from it, and only went home when the gates of the Luxembourg closed. He did not see M. Leblanc and his daughter retire. He concluded that they had quitted the garden by the gate on the Rue de l‚ÄôOuest. Later on, several weeks afterwards, when he came to think it over, he could never recall where he had dined that evening.
U||On the following day, which was the third, Ma‚Äôam Bougon was thunderstruck. Marius went out in his new coat. ‚ÄúThree days in succession!‚Äù she exclaimed.
U||She tried to follow him, but Marius walked briskly, and with immense strides; it was a hippopotamus undertaking the pursuit of a chamois. She lost sight of him in two minutes, and returned breathless, three-quarters choked with asthma, and furious. ‚ÄúIf there is any sense,‚Äù she growled, ‚Äúin putting on one‚Äôs best clothes every day, and making people run like this!‚Äù
U||Marius betook himself to the Luxembourg.
U||The young girl was there with M. Leblanc. Marius approached as near as he could, pretending to be busy reading a book, but he halted afar off, then returned and seated himself on his bench, where he spent four hours in watching the house-sparrows who were skipping about the walk, and who produced on him the impression that they were making sport of him.
U||A fortnight passed thus. Marius went to the Luxembourg no longer for the sake of strolling there, but to seat himself always in the same spot, and that without knowing why. Once arrived there, he did not stir. He put on his new coat every morning, for the purpose of not showing himself, and he began all over again on the morrow.
U||She was decidedly a marvellous beauty. The only remark approaching a criticism, that could be made, was, that the contradiction between her gaze, which was melancholy, and her smile, which was merry, gave a rather wild effect to her face, which sometimes caused this sweet countenance to become strange without ceasing to be charming.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîTAKEN PRISONER
U||On one of the last days of the second week, Marius was seated on his bench, as usual, holding in his hand an open book, of which he had not turned a page for the last two hours. All at once he started. An event was taking place at the other extremity of the walk. Leblanc and his daughter had just left their seat, and the daughter had taken her father‚Äôs arm, and both were advancing slowly, towards the middle of the alley where Marius was. Marius closed his book, then opened it again, then forced himself to read; he trembled; the aureole was coming straight towards him. ‚ÄúAh! good Heavens!‚Äù thought he, ‚ÄúI shall not have time to strike an attitude.‚Äù Still the white-haired man and the girl advanced. It seemed to him that this lasted for a century, and that it was but a second. ‚ÄúWhat are they coming in this direction for?‚Äù he asked himself. ‚ÄúWhat! She will pass here? Her feet will tread this sand, this walk, two paces from me?‚Äù He was utterly upset, he would have liked to be very handsome, he wou
U||ld have liked to own the cross. He heard the soft and measured sound of their approaching footsteps. He imagined that M. Leblanc was darting angry glances at him. ‚ÄúIs that gentleman going to address me?‚Äù he thought to himself. He dropped his head; when he raised it again, they were very near him. The young girl passed, and as she passed, she glanced at him. She gazed steadily at him, with a pensive sweetness which thrilled Marius from head to foot. It seemed to him that she was reproaching him for having allowed so long a time to elapse without coming as far as her, and that she was saying to him: ‚ÄúI am coming myself.‚Äù Marius was dazzled by those eyes fraught with rays and abysses.
U||He felt his brain on fire. She had come to him, what joy! And then, how she had looked at him! She appeared to him more beautiful than he had ever seen her yet. Beautiful with a beauty which was wholly feminine and angelic, with a complete beauty which would have made Petrarch sing and Dante kneel. It seemed to him that he was floating free in the azure heavens. At the same time, he was horribly vexed because there was dust on his boots.
U||He thought he felt sure that she had looked at his boots too.
U||He followed her with his eyes until she disappeared. Then he started up and walked about the Luxembourg garden like a madman. It is possible that, at times, he laughed to himself and talked aloud. He was so dreamy when he came near the children‚Äôs nurses, that each one of them thought him in love with her.
U||He quitted the Luxembourg, hoping to find her again in the street.
U||He encountered Courfeyrac under the arcades of the Od√©on, and said to him: ‚ÄúCome and dine with me.‚Äù They went off to Rousseau‚Äôs and spent six francs. Marius ate like an ogre. He gave the waiter six sous. At dessert, he said to Courfeyrac. ‚ÄúHave you read the paper? What a fine discourse Audry de Puyraveau delivered!‚Äù
U||He was desperately in love.
U||After dinner, he said to Courfeyrac: ‚ÄúI will treat you to the play.‚Äù They went to the Porte-Sainte-Martin to see Fr√©d√©rick in l‚ÄôAuberge des Adrets. Marius was enormously amused.
U||At the same time, he had a redoubled attack of shyness. On emerging from the theatre, he refused to look at the garter of a modiste who was stepping across a gutter, and Courfeyrac, who said: ‚ÄúI should like to put that woman in my collection,‚Äù almost horrified him.
U||Courfeyrac invited him to breakfast at the Caf√© Voltaire on the following morning. Marius went thither, and ate even more than on the preceding evening. He was very thoughtful and very merry. One would have said that he was taking advantage of every occasion to laugh uproariously. He tenderly embraced some man or other from the provinces, who was presented to him. A circle of students formed round the table, and they spoke of the nonsense paid for by the State which was uttered from the rostrum in the Sorbonne, then the conversation fell upon the faults and omissions in Guicherat‚Äôs dictionaries and grammars. Marius interrupted the discussion to exclaim: ‚ÄúBut it is very agreeable, all the same to have the cross!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat‚Äôs queer!‚Äù whispered Courfeyrac to Jean Prouvaire.
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù responded Prouvaire, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs serious.‚Äù
U||It was serious; in fact, Marius had reached that first violent and charming hour with which grand passions begin.
U||A glance had wrought all this.
U||When the mine is charged, when the conflagration is ready, nothing is more simple. A glance is a spark.
U||It was all over with him. Marius loved a woman. His fate was entering the unknown.
U||The glance of women resembles certain combinations of wheels, which are tranquil in appearance yet formidable. You pass close to them every day, peaceably and with impunity, and without a suspicion of anything. A moment arrives when you forget that the thing is there. You go and come, dream, speak, laugh. All at once you feel yourself clutched; all is over. The wheels hold you fast, the glance has ensnared you. It has caught you, no matter where or how, by some portion of your thought which was fluttering loose, by some distraction which had attacked you. You are lost. The whole of you passes into it. A chain of mysterious forces takes possession of you. You struggle in vain; no more human succor is possible. You go on falling from gearing to gearing, from agony to agony, from torture to torture, you, your mind, your fortune, your future, your soul; and, according to whether you are in the power of a wicked creature, or of a noble heart, you will not escape from this terrifying machine otherwise than disfigu
U||red with shame, or transfigured by passion.
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîADVENTURES OF THE LETTER U DELIVERED OVER TO CONJECTURES
U||Isolation, detachment, from everything, pride, independence, the taste of nature, the absence of daily and material activity, the life within himself, the secret conflicts of chastity, a benevolent ecstasy towards all creation, had prepared Marius for this possession which is called passion. His worship of his father had gradually become a religion, and, like all religions, it had retreated to the depths of his soul. Something was required in the foreground. Love came.
U||A full month elapsed, during which Marius went every day to the Luxembourg. When the hour arrived, nothing could hold him back.‚Äî‚ÄúHe is on duty,‚Äù said Courfeyrac. Marius lived in a state of delight. It is certain that the young girl did look at him.
U||He had finally grown bold, and approached the bench. Still, he did not pass in front of it any more, in obedience to the instinct of timidity and to the instinct of prudence common to lovers. He considered it better not to attract ‚Äúthe attention of the father.‚Äù He combined his stations behind the trees and the pedestals of the statues with a profound diplomacy, so that he might be seen as much as possible by the young girl and as little as possible by the old gentleman. Sometimes, he remained motionless by the half-hour together in the shade of a Leonidas or a Spartacus, holding in his hand a book, above which his eyes, gently raised, sought the beautiful girl, and she, on her side, turned her charming profile towards him with a vague smile. While conversing in the most natural and tranquil manner in the world with the white-haired man, she bent upon Marius all the reveries of a virginal and passionate eye. Ancient and time-honored man≈ìuvre which Eve understood from the very first day of the world, and 
U||which every woman understands from the very first day of her life! her mouth replied to one, and her glance replied to another.
U||It must be supposed, that M. Leblanc finally noticed something, for often, when Marius arrived, he rose and began to walk about. He had abandoned their accustomed place and had adopted the bench by the Gladiator, near the other end of the walk, as though with the object of seeing whether Marius would pursue them thither. Marius did not understand, and committed this error. ‚ÄúThe father‚Äù began to grow inexact, and no longer brought ‚Äúhis daughter‚Äù every day. Sometimes, he came alone. Then Marius did not stay. Another blunder.
U||Marius paid no heed to these symptoms. From the phase of timidity, he had passed, by a natural and fatal progress, to the phase of blindness. His love increased. He dreamed of it every night. And then, an unexpected bliss had happened to him, oil on the fire, a redoubling of the shadows over his eyes. One evening, at dusk, he had found, on the bench which ‚ÄúM. Leblanc and his daughter‚Äù had just quitted, a handkerchief, a very simple handkerchief, without embroidery, but white, and fine, and which seemed to him to exhale ineffable perfume. He seized it with rapture. This handkerchief was marked with the letters U. F. Marius knew nothing about this beautiful child,‚Äîneither her family name, her Christian name nor her abode; these two letters were the first thing of her that he had gained possession of, adorable initials, upon which he immediately began to construct his scaffolding. U was evidently the Christian name. ‚ÄúUrsule!‚Äù he thought, ‚Äúwhat a delicious name!‚Äù He kissed the handkerchief, drank i
U||t in, placed it on his heart, on his flesh, during the day, and at night, laid it beneath his lips that he might fall asleep on it.
U||‚ÄúI feel that her whole soul lies within it!‚Äù he exclaimed.
U||This handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman, who had simply let it fall from his pocket.
U||In the days which followed the finding of this treasure, he only displayed himself at the Luxembourg in the act of kissing the handkerchief and laying it on his heart. The beautiful child understood nothing of all this, and signified it to him by imperceptible signs.
U||‚ÄúO modesty!‚Äù said Marius.
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîTHE VETERANS THEMSELVES CAN BE HAPPY
U||Since we have pronounced the word modesty, and since we conceal nothing, we ought to say that once, nevertheless, in spite of his ecstasies, ‚Äúhis Ursule‚Äù caused him very serious grief. It was on one of the days when she persuaded M. Leblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk. A brisk May breeze was blowing, which swayed the crests of the plaintain-trees. The father and daughter, arm in arm, had just passed Marius‚Äô bench. Marius had risen to his feet behind them, and was following them with his eyes, as was fitting in the desperate situation of his soul.
U||All at once, a gust of wind, more merry than the rest, and probably charged with performing the affairs of Springtime, swept down from the nursery, flung itself on the alley, enveloped the young girl in a delicious shiver, worthy of Virgil‚Äôs nymphs, and the fawns of Theocritus, and lifted her dress, the robe more sacred than that of Isis, almost to the height of her garter. A leg of exquisite shape appeared. Marius saw it. He was exasperated and furious.
U||The young girl had hastily thrust down her dress, with a divinely troubled motion, but he was nonetheless angry for all that. He was alone in the alley, it is true. But there might have been some one there. And what if there had been some one there! Can any one comprehend such a thing? What she had just done is horrible!‚ÄîAlas, the poor child had done nothing; there had been but one culprit, the wind; but Marius, in whom quivered the Bartholo who exists in Cherubin, was determined to be vexed, and was jealous of his own shadow. It is thus, in fact, that the harsh and capricious jealousy of the flesh awakens in the human heart, and takes possession of it, even without any right. Moreover, setting aside even that jealousy, the sight of that charming leg had contained nothing agreeable for him; the white stocking of the first woman he chanced to meet would have afforded him more pleasure.
U||When ‚Äúhis Ursule,‚Äù after having reached the end of the walk, retraced her steps with M. Leblanc, and passed in front of the bench on which Marius had seated himself once more, Marius darted a sullen and ferocious glance at her. The young girl gave way to that slight straightening up with a backward movement, accompanied by a raising of the eyelids, which signifies: ‚ÄúWell, what is the matter?‚Äù
U||This was ‚Äútheir first quarrel.‚Äù
U||Marius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes, when some one crossed the walk. It was a veteran, very much bent, extremely wrinkled, and pale, in a uniform of the Louis XV. pattern, bearing on his breast the little oval plaque of red cloth, with the crossed swords, the soldier‚Äôs cross of Saint-Louis, and adorned, in addition, with a coat-sleeve, which had no arm within it, with a silver chin and a wooden leg. Marius thought he perceived that this man had an extremely well satisfied air. It even struck him that the aged cynic, as he hobbled along past him, addressed to him a very fraternal and very merry wink, as though some chance had created an understanding between them, and as though they had shared some piece of good luck together. What did that relic of Mars mean by being so contented? What had passed between that wooden leg and the other? Marius reached a paroxysm of jealousy.‚Äî‚ÄúPerhaps he was there!‚Äù he said to himself; ‚Äúperhaps he saw!‚Äù‚ÄîAnd he felt a desire to exterminate the ve
U||teran.
U||With the aid of time, all points grow dull. Marius‚Äô wrath against ‚ÄúUrsule,‚Äù just and legitimate as it was, passed off. He finally pardoned her; but this cost him a great effort; he sulked for three days.
U||Nevertheless, in spite of all this, and because of all this, his passion augmented and grew to madness.
U||CHAPTER IX‚ÄîECLIPSE
U||The reader has just seen how Marius discovered, or thought that he discovered, that She was named Ursule.
U||Appetite grows with loving. To know that her name was Ursule was a great deal; it was very little. In three or four weeks, Marius had devoured this bliss. He wanted another. He wanted to know where she lived.
U||He had committed his first blunder, by falling into the ambush of the bench by the Gladiator. He had committed a second, by not remaining at the Luxembourg when M. Leblanc came thither alone. He now committed a third, and an immense one. He followed ‚ÄúUrsule.‚Äù
U||She lived in the Rue de l‚ÄôOuest, in the most unfrequented spot, in a new, three-story house, of modest appearance.
U||From that moment forth, Marius added to his happiness of seeing her at the Luxembourg the happiness of following her home.
U||His hunger was increasing. He knew her first name, at least, a charming name, a genuine woman‚Äôs name; he knew where she lived; he wanted to know who she was.
U||One evening, after he had followed them to their dwelling, and had seen them disappear through the carriage gate, he entered in their train and said boldly to the porter:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIs that the gentleman who lives on the first floor, who has just come in?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù replied the porter. ‚ÄúHe is the gentleman on the third floor.‚Äù
U||Another step gained. This success emboldened Marius.
U||‚ÄúOn the front?‚Äù he asked.
U||‚ÄúParbleu!‚Äù said the porter, ‚Äúthe house is only built on the street.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd what is that gentleman‚Äôs business?‚Äù began Marius again.
U||‚ÄúHe is a gentleman of property, sir. A very kind man who does good to the unfortunate, though not rich himself.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is his name?‚Äù resumed Marius.
U||The porter raised his head and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAre you a police spy, sir?‚Äù
U||Marius went off quite abashed, but delighted. He was getting on.
U||‚ÄúGood,‚Äù thought he, ‚ÄúI know that her name is Ursule, that she is the daughter of a gentleman who lives on his income, and that she lives there, on the third floor, in the Rue de l‚ÄôOuest.‚Äù
U||On the following day, M. Leblanc and his daughter made only a very brief stay in the Luxembourg; they went away while it was still broad daylight. Marius followed them to the Rue de l‚ÄôOuest, as he had taken up the habit of doing. On arriving at the carriage entrance M. Leblanc made his daughter pass in first, then paused, before crossing the threshold, and stared intently at Marius.
U||On the next day they did not come to the Luxembourg. Marius waited for them all day in vain.
U||At nightfall, he went to the Rue de l‚ÄôOuest, and saw a light in the windows of the third story.
U||He walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished.
U||The next day, no one at the Luxembourg. Marius waited all day, then went and did sentinel duty under their windows. This carried him on to ten o‚Äôclock in the evening.
U||His dinner took care of itself. Fever nourishes the sick man, and love the lover.
U||He spent a week in this manner. M. Leblanc no longer appeared at the Luxembourg.
U||Marius indulged in melancholy conjectures; he dared not watch the porte-coch√®re during the day; he contented himself with going at night to gaze upon the red light of the windows. At times he saw shadows flit across them, and his heart began to beat.
U||On the eighth day, when he arrived under the windows, there was no light in them.
U||‚ÄúHello!‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthe lamp is not lighted yet. But it is dark. Can they have gone out?‚Äù He waited until ten o‚Äôclock. Until midnight. Until one in the morning. Not a light appeared in the windows of the third story, and no one entered the house.
U||He went away in a very gloomy frame of mind.
U||On the morrow,‚Äîfor he only existed from morrow to morrow, there was, so to speak, no to-day for him,‚Äîon the morrow, he found no one at the Luxembourg; he had expected this. At dusk, he went to the house.
U||No light in the windows; the shades were drawn; the third floor was totally dark.
U||Marius rapped at the porte-coch√®re, entered, and said to the porter:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe gentleman on the third floor?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHas moved away,‚Äù replied the porter.
U||Marius reeled and said feebly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHow long ago?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYesterday.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhere is he living now?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything about it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSo he has not left his new address?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||And the porter, raising his eyes, recognized Marius.
U||‚ÄúCome! So it‚Äôs you!‚Äù said he; ‚Äúbut you are decidedly a spy then?‚Äù
U||BOOK SEVENTH‚ÄîPATRON MINETTE
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîMINES AND MINERS
U||Human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance, a third lower floor. The social soil is everywhere undermined, sometimes for good, sometimes for evil. These works are superposed one upon the other. There are superior mines and inferior mines. There is a top and a bottom in this obscure sub-soil, which sometimes gives way beneath civilization, and which our indifference and heedlessness trample under foot. The Encyclopedia, in the last century, was a mine that was almost open to the sky. The shades, those sombre hatchers of primitive Christianity, only awaited an opportunity to bring about an explosion under the C√¶sars and to inundate the human race with light. For in the sacred shadows there lies latent light. Volcanoes are full of a shadow that is capable of flashing forth. Every form begins by being night. The catacombs, in which the first mass was said, were not alone the cellar of Rome, they were the vaults of the world.
U||Beneath the social construction, that complicated marvel of a structure, there are excavations of all sorts. There is the religious mine, the philosophical mine, the economic mine, the revolutionary mine. Such and such a pick-axe with the idea, such a pick with ciphers. Such another with wrath. People hail and answer each other from one catacomb to another. Utopias travel about underground, in the pipes. There they branch out in every direction. They sometimes meet, and fraternize there. Jean-Jacques lends his pick to Diogenes, who lends him his lantern. Sometimes they enter into combat there. Calvin seizes Socinius by the hair. But nothing arrests nor interrupts the tension of all these energies toward the goal, and the vast, simultaneous activity, which goes and comes, mounts, descends, and mounts again in these obscurities, and which immense unknown swarming slowly transforms the top and the bottom and the inside and the outside. Society hardly even suspects this digging which leaves its surface intact an
U||d changes its bowels. There are as many different subterranean stages as there are varying works, as there are extractions. What emerges from these deep excavations? The future.
U||The deeper one goes, the more mysterious are the toilers. The work is good, up to a degree which the social philosophies are able to recognize; beyond that degree it is doubtful and mixed; lower down, it becomes terrible. At a certain depth, the excavations are no longer penetrable by the spirit of civilization, the limit breathable by man has been passed; a beginning of monsters is possible.
U||The descending scale is a strange one; and each one of the rungs of this ladder corresponds to a stage where philosophy can find foothold, and where one encounters one of these workmen, sometimes divine, sometimes misshapen. Below John Huss, there is Luther; below Luther, there is Descartes; below Descartes, there is Voltaire; below Voltaire, there is Condorcet; below Condorcet, there is Robespierre; below Robespierre, there is Marat; below Marat there is Babeuf. And so it goes on. Lower down, confusedly, at the limit which separates the indistinct from the invisible, one perceives other gloomy men, who perhaps do not exist as yet. The men of yesterday are spectres; those of to-morrow are forms. The eye of the spirit distinguishes them but obscurely. The embryonic work of the future is one of the visions of philosophy.
U||A world in limbo, in the state of f≈ìtus, what an unheard-of spectre!
U||Saint-Simon, Owen, Fourier, are there also, in lateral galleries.
U||Surely, although a divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves, binds together all these subterranean pioneers who, almost always, think themselves isolated, and who are not so, their works vary greatly, and the light of some contrasts with the blaze of others. The first are paradisiacal, the last are tragic. Nevertheless, whatever may be the contrast, all these toilers, from the highest to the most nocturnal, from the wisest to the most foolish, possess one likeness, and this is it: disinterestedness. Marat forgets himself like Jesus. They throw themselves on one side, they omit themselves, they think not of themselves. They have a glance, and that glance seeks the absolute. The first has the whole heavens in his eyes; the last, enigmatical though he may be, has still, beneath his eyelids, the pale beam of the infinite. Venerate the man, whoever he may be, who has this sign‚Äîthe starry eye.
U||The shadowy eye is the other sign.
U||With it, evil commences. Reflect and tremble in the presence of any one who has no glance at all. The social order has its black miners.
U||There is a point where depth is tantamount to burial, and where light becomes extinct.
U||Below all these mines which we have just mentioned, below all these galleries, below this whole immense, subterranean, venous system of progress and utopia, much further on in the earth, much lower than Marat, lower than Babeuf, lower, much lower, and without any connection with the upper levels, there lies the last mine. A formidable spot. This is what we have designated as the le troisi√®me dessous. It is the grave of shadows. It is the cellar of the blind. Inferi.
U||This communicates with the abyss.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîTHE LOWEST DEPTHS
U||There disinterestedness vanishes. The demon is vaguely outlined; each one is for himself. The I in the eyes howls, seeks, fumbles, and gnaws. The social Ugolino is in this gulf.
U||The wild spectres who roam in this grave, almost beasts, almost phantoms, are not occupied with universal progress; they are ignorant both of the idea and of the word; they take no thought for anything but the satisfaction of their individual desires. They are almost unconscious, and there exists within them a sort of terrible obliteration. They have two mothers, both step-mothers, ignorance and misery. They have a guide, necessity; and for all forms of satisfaction, appetite. They are brutally voracious, that is to say, ferocious, not after the fashion of the tyrant, but after the fashion of the tiger. From suffering these spectres pass to crime; fatal affiliation, dizzy creation, logic of darkness. That which crawls in the social third lower level is no longer complaint stifled by the absolute; it is the protest of matter. Man there becomes a dragon. To be hungry, to be thirsty‚Äîthat is the point of departure; to be Satan‚Äîthat is the point reached. From that vault Lacenaire emerges.
U||We have just seen, in Book Fourth, one of the compartments of the upper mine, of the great political, revolutionary, and philosophical excavation. There, as we have just said, all is pure, noble, dignified, honest. There, assuredly, one might be misled; but error is worthy of veneration there, so thoroughly does it imply heroism. The work there effected, taken as a whole has a name: Progress.
U||The moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths, hideous depths. There exists beneath society, we insist upon this point, and there will exist, until that day when ignorance shall be dissipated, the great cavern of evil.
U||This cavern is below all, and is the foe of all. It is hatred, without exception. This cavern knows no philosophers; its dagger has never cut a pen. Its blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of the inkstand. Never have the fingers of night which contract beneath this stifling ceiling, turned the leaves of a book nor unfolded a newspaper. Babeuf is a speculator to Cartouche; Marat is an aristocrat to Schinderhannes. This cavern has for its object the destruction of everything.
U||Of everything. Including the upper superior mines, which it execrates. It not only undermines, in its hideous swarming, the actual social order; it undermines philosophy, it undermines human thought, it undermines civilization, it undermines revolution, it undermines progress. Its name is simply theft, prostitution, murder, assassination. It is darkness, and it desires chaos. Its vault is formed of ignorance.
U||All the others, those above it, have but one object‚Äîto suppress it. It is to this point that philosophy and progress tend, with all their organs simultaneously, by their amelioration of the real, as well as by their contemplation of the absolute. Destroy the cavern Ignorance and you destroy the lair Crime.
U||Let us condense, in a few words, a part of what we have just written. The only social peril is darkness.
U||Humanity is identity. All men are made of the same clay. There is no difference, here below, at least, in predestination. The same shadow in front, the same flesh in the present, the same ashes afterwards. But ignorance, mingled with the human paste, blackens it. This incurable blackness takes possession of the interior of a man and is there converted into evil.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîBABET, GUEULEMER, CLAQUESOUS, AND MONTPARNASSE
U||A quartette of ruffians, Claquesous, Gueulemer, Babet, and Montparnasse governed the third lower floor of Paris, from 1830 to 1835.
U||Gueulemer was a Hercules of no defined position. For his lair he had the sewer of the Arche-Marion. He was six feet high, his pectoral muscles were of marble, his biceps of brass, his breath was that of a cavern, his torso that of a colossus, his head that of a bird. One thought one beheld the Farnese Hercules clad in duck trousers and a cotton velvet waistcoat. Gueulemer, built after this sculptural fashion, might have subdued monsters; he had found it more expeditious to be one. A low brow, large temples, less than forty years of age, but with crow‚Äôs-feet, harsh, short hair, cheeks like a brush, a beard like that of a wild boar; the reader can see the man before him. His muscles called for work, his stupidity would have none of it. He was a great, idle force. He was an assassin through coolness. He was thought to be a creole. He had, probably, somewhat to do with Marshal Brune, having been a porter at Avignon in 1815. After this stage, he had turned ruffian.
U||The diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the grossness of Gueulemer. Babet was thin and learned. He was transparent but impenetrable. Daylight was visible through his bones, but nothing through his eyes. He declared that he was a chemist. He had been a jack of all trades. He had played in vaudeville at Saint-Mihiel. He was a man of purpose, a fine talker, who underlined his smiles and accentuated his gestures. His occupation consisted in selling, in the open air, plaster busts and portraits of ‚Äúthe head of the State.‚Äù In addition to this, he extracted teeth. He had exhibited phenomena at fairs, and he had owned a booth with a trumpet and this poster: ‚ÄúBabet, Dental Artist, Member of the Academies, makes physical experiments on metals and metalloids, extracts teeth, undertakes stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners. Price: one tooth, one franc, fifty centimes; two teeth, two francs; three teeth, two francs, fifty. Take advantage of this opportunity.‚Äù This Take advantage of this opportunity mean
U||t: Have as many teeth extracted as possible. He had been married and had had children. He did not know what had become of his wife and children. He had lost them as one loses his handkerchief. Babet read the papers, a striking exception in the world to which he belonged. One day, at the period when he had his family with him in his booth on wheels, he had read in the Messager, that a woman had just given birth to a child, who was doing well, and had a calf‚Äôs muzzle, and he exclaimed: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a fortune! my wife has not the wit to present me with a child like that!‚Äù
U||Later on he had abandoned everything, in order to ‚Äúundertake Paris.‚Äù This was his expression.
U||Who was Claquesous? He was night. He waited until the sky was daubed with black, before he showed himself. At nightfall he emerged from the hole whither he returned before daylight. Where was this hole? No one knew. He only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute darkness, and with his back turned to them. Was his name Claquesous? Certainly not. If a candle was brought, he put on a mask. He was a ventriloquist. Babet said: ‚ÄúClaquesous is a nocturne for two voices.‚Äù Claquesous was vague, terrible, and a roamer. No one was sure whether he had a name, Claquesous being a sobriquet; none was sure that he had a voice, as his stomach spoke more frequently than his voice; no one was sure that he had a face, as he was never seen without his mask. He disappeared as though he had vanished into thin air; when he appeared, it was as though he sprang from the earth.
U||A lugubrious being was Montparnasse. Montparnasse was a child; less than twenty years of age, with a handsome face, lips like cherries, charming black hair, the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes; he had all vices and aspired to all crimes.
U||The digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse. It was the street boy turned pickpocket, and a pickpocket turned garroter. He was genteel, effeminate, graceful, robust, sluggish, ferocious. The rim of his hat was curled up on the left side, in order to make room for a tuft of hair, after the style of 1829. He lived by robbery with violence. His coat was of the best cut, but threadbare. Montparnasse was a fashion-plate in misery and given to the commission of murders. The cause of all this youth‚Äôs crimes was the desire to be well-dressed. The first grisette who had said to him: ‚ÄúYou are handsome!‚Äù had cast the stain of darkness into his heart, and had made a Cain of this Abel. Finding that he was handsome, he desired to be elegant: now, the height of elegance is idleness; idleness in a poor man means crime. Few prowlers were so dreaded as Montparnasse. At eighteen, he had already numerous corpses in his past. More than one passer-by lay with outstretched arms in the presence of this wretch, 
U||with his face in a pool of blood. Curled, pomaded, with laced waist, the hips of a woman, the bust of a Prussian officer, the murmur of admiration from the boulevard wenches surrounding him, his cravat knowingly tied, a bludgeon in his pocket, a flower in his buttonhole; such was this dandy of the sepulchre.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîCOMPOSITION OF THE TROUPE
U||These four ruffians formed a sort of Proteus, winding like a serpent among the police, and striving to escape Vidocq‚Äôs indiscreet glances ‚Äúunder divers forms, tree, flame, fountain,‚Äù lending each other their names and their traps, hiding in their own shadows, boxes with secret compartments and refuges for each other, stripping off their personalities, as one removes his false nose at a masked ball, sometimes simplifying matters to the point of consisting of but one individual, sometimes multiplying themselves to such a point that Coco-Latour himself took them for a whole throng.
U||These four men were not four men; they were a sort of mysterious robber with four heads, operating on a grand scale on Paris; they were that monstrous polyp of evil, which inhabits the crypt of society.
U||Thanks to their ramifications, and to the network underlying their relations, Babet, Gueulemer, Claquesous, and Montparnasse were charged with the general enterprise of the ambushes of the department of the Seine. The inventors of ideas of that nature, men with nocturnal imaginations, applied to them to have their ideas executed. They furnished the canvas to the four rascals, and the latter undertook the preparation of the scenery. They labored at the stage setting. They were always in a condition to lend a force proportioned and suitable to all crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder, and which were sufficiently lucrative. When a crime was in quest of arms, they under-let their accomplices. They kept a troupe of actors of the shadows at the disposition of all underground tragedies.
U||They were in the habit of assembling at nightfall, the hour when they woke up, on the plains which adjoin the Salp√™tri√®re. There they held their conferences. They had twelve black hours before them; they regulated their employment accordingly.
U||Patron-Minette,‚Äîsuch was the name which was bestowed in the subterranean circulation on the association of these four men. In the fantastic, ancient, popular parlance, which is vanishing day by day, Patron-Minette signifies the morning, the same as entre chien et loup‚Äîbetween dog and wolf‚Äîsignifies the evening. This appellation, Patron-Minette, was probably derived from the hour at which their work ended, the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and for the separation of ruffians. These four men were known under this title. When the President of the Assizes visited Lacenaire in his prison, and questioned him concerning a misdeed which Lacenaire denied, ‚ÄúWho did it?‚Äù demanded the President. Lacenaire made this response, enigmatical so far as the magistrate was concerned, but clear to the police: ‚ÄúPerhaps it was Patron-Minette.‚Äù
U||A piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages; in the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of ruffians composing it. Here are the appellations to which the principal members of Patron-Minette answered,‚Äîfor the names have survived in special memoirs.
U||Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille.
U||Brujon. [There was a Brujon dynasty; we cannot refrain from interpolating this word.]
U||Boulatruelle, the road-mender already introduced.
U||Laveuve.
U||Finist√®re.
U||Hom√®re-Hogu, a negro.
U||Mardisoir. (Tuesday evening.)
U||D√©p√™che. (Make haste.)

U||Demi-Liard, called Deux-Milliards.
U||Etc., etc.
U||We pass over some, and not the worst of them. These names have faces attached. They do not express merely beings, but species. Each one of these names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi from the under side of civilization.
U||Those beings, who were not very lavish with their countenances, were not among the men whom one sees passing along the streets. Fatigued by the wild nights which they passed, they went off by day to sleep, sometimes in the lime-kilns, sometimes in the abandoned quarries of Montmatre or Montrouge, sometimes in the sewers. They ran to earth.
U||What became of these men? They still exist. They have always existed. Horace speaks of them: Ambubaiarum collegia, pharmacopol√¶, mendici, mim√¶; and so long as society remains what it is, they will remain what they are. Beneath the obscure roof of their cavern, they are continually born again from the social ooze. They return, spectres, but always identical; only, they no longer bear the same names and they are no longer in the same skins. The individuals extirpated, the tribe subsists.
U||They always have the same faculties. From the vagrant to the tramp, the race is maintained in its purity. They divine purses in pockets, they scent out watches in fobs. Gold and silver possess an odor for them. There exist ingenuous bourgeois, of whom it might be said, that they have a ‚Äústealable‚Äù air. These men patiently pursue these bourgeois. They experience the quivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger or of a man from the country.
U||These men are terrible, when one encounters them, or catches a glimpse of them, towards midnight, on a deserted boulevard. They do not seem to be men but forms composed of living mists; one would say that they habitually constitute one mass with the shadows, that they are in no wise distinct from them, that they possess no other soul than the darkness, and that it is only momentarily and for the purpose of living for a few minutes a monstrous life, that they have separated from the night.
U||What is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish? Light. Light in floods. Not a single bat can resist the dawn. Light up society from below.
U||BOOK EIGHTH‚ÄîTHE WICKED POOR MAN
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîMARIUS, WHILE SEEKING A GIRL IN A BONNET, ENCOUNTERS A MAN IN A CAP
U||Summer passed, then the autumn; winter came. Neither M. Leblanc nor the young girl had again set foot in the Luxembourg garden. Thenceforth, Marius had but one thought,‚Äîto gaze once more on that sweet and adorable face. He sought constantly, he sought everywhere; he found nothing. He was no longer Marius, the enthusiastic dreamer, the firm, resolute, ardent man, the bold defier of fate, the brain which erected future on future, the young spirit encumbered with plans, with projects, with pride, with ideas and wishes; he was a lost dog. He fell into a black melancholy. All was over. Work disgusted him, walking tired him. Vast nature, formerly so filled with forms, lights, voices, counsels, perspectives, horizons, teachings, now lay empty before him. It seemed to him that everything had disappeared.
U||He thought incessantly, for he could not do otherwise; but he no longer took pleasure in his thoughts. To everything that they proposed to him in a whisper, he replied in his darkness: ‚ÄúWhat is the use?‚Äù
U||He heaped a hundred reproaches on himself. ‚ÄúWhy did I follow her? I was so happy at the mere sight of her! She looked at me; was not that immense? She had the air of loving me. Was not that everything? I wished to have, what? There was nothing after that. I have been absurd. It is my own fault,‚Äù etc., etc. Courfeyrac, to whom he confided nothing,‚Äîit was his nature,‚Äîbut who made some little guess at everything,‚Äîthat was his nature,‚Äîhad begun by congratulating him on being in love, though he was amazed at it; then, seeing Marius fall into this melancholy state, he ended by saying to him: ‚ÄúI see that you have been simply an animal. Here, come to the Chaumi√®re.‚Äù
U||Once, having confidence in a fine September sun, Marius had allowed himself to be taken to the ball at Sceaux by Courfeyrac, Bossuet, and Grantaire, hoping, what a dream! that he might, perhaps, find her there. Of course he did not see the one he sought.‚Äî‚ÄúBut this is the place, all the same, where all lost women are found,‚Äù grumbled Grantaire in an aside. Marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on foot, alone, through the night, weary, feverish, with sad and troubled eyes, stunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with singing creatures on their way home from the feast, which passed close to him, as he, in his discouragement, breathed in the acrid scent of the walnut-trees, along the road, in order to refresh his head.
U||He took to living more and more alone, utterly overwhelmed, wholly given up to his inward anguish, going and coming in his pain like the wolf in the trap, seeking the absent one everywhere, stupefied by love.
U||On another occasion, he had an encounter which produced on him a singular effect. He met, in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the Boulevard des Invalides, a man dressed like a workingman and wearing a cap with a long visor, which allowed a glimpse of locks of very white hair. Marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair, and scrutinized the man, who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in painful meditation. Strange to say, he thought that he recognized M. Leblanc. The hair was the same, also the profile, so far as the cap permitted a view of it, the mien identical, only more depressed. But why these workingman‚Äôs clothes? What was the meaning of this? What signified that disguise? Marius was greatly astonished. When he recovered himself, his first impulse was to follow the man; who knows whether he did not hold at last the clue which he was seeking? In any case, he must see the man near at hand, and clear up the mystery. But the idea occurred to him too late, the man was no longer there. 
U||He had turned into some little side street, and Marius could not find him. This encounter occupied his mind for three days and then was effaced. ‚ÄúAfter all,‚Äù he said to himself, ‚Äúit was probably only a resemblance.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîTREASURE TROVE
U||Marius had not left the Gorbeau house. He paid no attention to any one there.
U||At that epoch, to tell the truth, there were no other inhabitants in the house, except himself and those Jondrettes whose rent he had once paid, without, moreover, ever having spoken to either father, mother, or daughters. The other lodgers had moved away or had died, or had been turned out in default of payment.
U||One day during that winter, the sun had shown itself a little in the afternoon, but it was the 2d of February, that ancient Candlemas day whose treacherous sun, the precursor of a six weeks‚Äô cold spell, inspired Mathieu Laensberg with these two lines, which have with justice remained classic:‚Äî
U||Qu‚Äôil luise ou qu‚Äôil luiserne,
U||L‚Äôours rentre dans en sa caverne.26
U||Marius had just emerged from his: night was falling. It was the hour for his dinner; for he had been obliged to take to dining again, alas! oh, infirmities of ideal passions!
U||He had just crossed his threshold, where Ma‚Äôam Bougon was sweeping at the moment, as she uttered this memorable monologue:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat is there that is cheap now? Everything is dear. There is nothing in the world that is cheap except trouble; you can get that for nothing, the trouble of the world!‚Äù
U||Marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier, in order to reach the Rue Saint-Jacques. He was walking along with drooping head.
U||All at once, he felt some one elbow him in the dusk; he wheeled round, and saw two young girls clad in rags, the one tall and slim, the other a little shorter, who were passing rapidly, all out of breath, in terror, and with the appearance of fleeing; they had been coming to meet him, had not seen him, and had jostled him as they passed. Through the twilight, Marius could distinguish their livid faces, their wild heads, their dishevelled hair, their hideous bonnets, their ragged petticoats, and their bare feet. They were talking as they ran. The taller said in a very low voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe bobbies have come. They came near nabbing me at the half-circle.‚Äù The other answered: ‚ÄúI saw them. I bolted, bolted, bolted!‚Äù
U||Through this repulsive slang, Marius understood that gendarmes or the police had come near apprehending these two children, and that the latter had escaped.
U||They plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him, and there created, for a few minutes, in the gloom, a sort of vague white spot, then disappeared.
U||Marius had halted for a moment.
U||He was about to pursue his way, when his eye lighted on a little grayish package lying on the ground at his feet. He stooped and picked it up. It was a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers.
U||‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he said to himself, ‚Äúthose unhappy girls dropped it.‚Äù
U||He retraced his steps, he called, he did not find them; he reflected that they must already be far away, put the package in his pocket, and went off to dine.
U||On the way, he saw in an alley of the Rue Mouffetard, a child‚Äôs coffin, covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs, and illuminated by a candle. The two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind.
U||‚ÄúPoor mothers!‚Äù he thought. ‚ÄúThere is one thing sadder than to see one‚Äôs children die; it is to see them leading an evil life.‚Äù
U||Then those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished from his thoughts, and he fell back once more into his habitual preoccupations. He fell to thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness in the open air and the broad daylight, beneath the beautiful trees of Luxembourg.
U||‚ÄúHow gloomy my life has become!‚Äù he said to himself. ‚ÄúYoung girls are always appearing to me, only formerly they were angels and now they are ghouls.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîQUADRIFRONS
U||That evening, as he was undressing preparatory to going to bed, his hand came in contact, in the pocket of his coat, with the packet which he had picked up on the boulevard. He had forgotten it. He thought that it would be well to open it, and that this package might possibly contain the address of the young girls, if it really belonged to them, and, in any case, the information necessary to a restitution to the person who had lost it.
U||He opened the envelope.
U||It was not sealed and contained four letters, also unsealed.
U||They bore addresses.
U||All four exhaled a horrible odor of tobacco.
U||The first was addressed: ‚ÄúTo Madame, Madame la Marquise de Grucheray, the place opposite the Chamber of Deputies, No.‚Äî‚Äù
U||Marius said to himself, that he should probably find in it the information which he sought, and that, moreover, the letter being open, it was probable that it could be read without impropriety.
U||It was conceived as follows:‚Äî
U||Madame la Marquise: The virtue of clemency and piety is that which most closely unites sosiety. Turn your Christian spirit and cast a look of compassion on this unfortunate Spanish victim of loyalty and attachment to the sacred cause of legitimacy, who has given with his blood, consecrated his fortune, evverything, to defend that cause, and to-day finds himself in the greatest missery. He doubts not that your honorable person will grant succor to preserve an existence exteremely painful for a military man of education and honor full of wounds, counts in advance on the humanity which animates you and on the interest which Madame la Marquise bears to a nation so unfortunate. Their prayer will not be in vain, and their gratitude will preserve theirs charming souvenir.
U||My respectful sentiments, with which I have the honor to be
U||Madame,
U||    DON ALVAR√àS, Spanish Captain of Cavalry, a royalist who has take refuge in France, who finds himself on travells for his country, and the resources are lacking him to continue his travells.
U||No address was joined to the signature. Marius hoped to find the address in the second letter, whose superscription read: √Ä Madame, Madame la Comtesse de Montvernet, Rue Cassette, No. 9. This is what Marius read in it:‚Äî
U||MADAME LA COMTESSE: It is an unhappy mother of a family of six children the last of which is only eight months old. I sick since my last confinement, abandoned by my husband five months ago, haveing no resources in the world the most frightful indigance.
U||    In the hope of Madame la Comtesse, she has the honor to be, Madame, with profound respect,
U||MISTRESS BALIZARD.
U||Marius turned to the third letter, which was a petition like the preceding; he read:‚Äî
U||Monsieur PABOURGEOT, Elector, wholesale stocking merchant, Rue Saint-Denis on the corner of the Rue aux Fers.
U||    I permit myself to address you this letter to beg you to grant me the pretious favor of your simpaties and to interest yourself in a man of letters who has just sent a drama to the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais. The subject is historical, and the action takes place in Auvergne in the time of the Empire; the style, I think, is natural, laconic, and may have some merit. There are couplets to be sung in four places. The comic, the serious, the unexpected, are mingled in a variety of characters, and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue which proceeds misteriously, and ends, after striking altarations, in the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes.
U||    My principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively animates the man of our century, that is to say, the fashion, that capritious and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost every new wind.
U||    In spite of these qualities I have reason to fear that jealousy, the egotism of priviliged authors, may obtaine my exclusion from the theatre, for I am not ignorant of the mortifications with which newcomers are treated.
U||    Monsiuer Pabourgeot, your just reputation as an enlightened protector of men of litters emboldens me to send you my daughter who will explain our indigant situation to you, lacking bread and fire in this wynter season. When I say to you that I beg you to accept the dedication of my drama which I desire to make to you and of all those that I shall make, is to prove to you how great is my ambition to have the honor of sheltering myself under your protection, and of adorning my writings with your name. If you deign to honor me with the most modest offering, I shall immediately occupy myself in making a piesse of verse to pay you my tribute of gratitude. Which I shall endeavor to render this piesse as perfect as possible, will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the drama and delivered on the stage.
U||To Monsieur
U||and Madame Pabourgeot,
U||My most respectful complements,
U||GENFLOT, man of letters.
U||P. S. Even if it is only forty sous.
U||    Excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself, but sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me, alas! to go out.
U||Finally, Marius opened the fourth letter. The address ran: To the benevolent Gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-haut-Pas. It contained the following lines:‚Äî
U||BENEVOLENT MAN: If you deign to accompany my daughter, you will behold a misserable calamity, and I will show you my certificates.
U||    At the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved with a sentiment of obvious benevolence, for true philosophers always feel lively emotions.
U||    Admit, compassionate man, that it is necessary to suffer the most cruel need, and that it is very painful, for the sake of obtaining a little relief, to get oneself attested by the authorities as though one were not free to suffer and to die of inanition while waiting to have our misery relieved. Destinies are very fatal for several and too prodigal or too protecting for others.
U||    I await your presence or your offering, if you deign to make one, and I beseech you to accept the respectful sentiments with which I have the honor to be,
U||truly magnanimous man,
U||your very humble
U||and very obedient servant,
U||P. FABANTOU, dramatic artist.
U||After perusing these four letters, Marius did not find himself much further advanced than before.
U||In the first place, not one of the signers gave his address.
U||Then, they seemed to come from four different individuals, Don Alvar√®s, Mistress Balizard, the poet Genflot, and dramatic artist Fabantou; but the singular thing about these letters was, that all four were written by the same hand.
U||What conclusion was to be drawn from this, except that they all come from the same person?
U||Moreover, and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable, the coarse and yellow paper was the same in all four, the odor of tobacco was the same, and, although an attempt had been made to vary the style, the same orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest tranquillity, and the man of letters Genflot was no more exempt from them than the Spanish captain.
U||It was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery. Had it not been a chance find, it would have borne the air of a mystification. Marius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well, and to lend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirous of playing with him. It seemed to him that he was playing the part of the blind man in blind man‚Äôs buff between the four letters, and that they were making sport of him.
U||Nothing, however, indicated that these letters belonged to the two young girls whom Marius had met on the boulevard. After all, they were evidently papers of no value. Marius replaced them in their envelope, flung the whole into a corner and went to bed. About seven o‚Äôclock in the morning, he had just risen and breakfasted, and was trying to settle down to work, when there came a soft knock at his door.
U||As he owned nothing, he never locked his door, unless occasionally, though very rarely, when he was engaged in some pressing work. Even when absent he left his key in the lock. ‚ÄúYou will be robbed,‚Äù said Ma‚Äôam Bougon. ‚ÄúOf what?‚Äù said Marius. The truth is, however, that he had, one day, been robbed of an old pair of boots, to the great triumph of Ma‚Äôam Bougon.
U||There came a second knock, as gentle as the first.
U||‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù said Marius.
U||The door opened.
U||‚ÄúWhat do you want, Ma‚Äôam Bougon?‚Äù asked Marius, without raising his eyes from the books and manuscripts on his table.
U||A voice which did not belong to Ma‚Äôam Bougon replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúExcuse me, sir‚Äî‚Äù
U||It was a dull, broken, hoarse, strangled voice, the voice of an old man, roughened with brandy and liquor.
U||Marius turned round hastily, and beheld a young girl.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîA ROSE IN MISERY
U||Rose in Misery
U||A very young girl was standing in the half-open door. The dormer window of the garret, through which the light fell, was precisely opposite the door, and illuminated the figure with a wan light. She was a frail, emaciated, slender creature; there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness. Her girdle was a string, her head ribbon a string, her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise, a blond and lymphatic pallor, earth-colored collar-bones, red hands, a half-open and degraded mouth, missing teeth, dull, bold, base eyes; she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth, and the look of a corrupt old woman; fifty years mingled with fifteen; one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible, and which cause those to shudder whom they do not cause to weep.
U||Marius had risen, and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being, who was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams.
U||The most heart-breaking thing of all was, that this young girl had not come into the world to be homely. In her early childhood she must even have been pretty. The grace of her age was still struggling against the hideous, premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty. The remains of beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen, like the pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a winter‚Äôs day.
U||That face was not wholly unknown to Marius. He thought he remembered having seen it somewhere.
U||‚ÄúWhat do you wish, Mademoiselle?‚Äù he asked.
U||The young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHere is a letter for you, Monsieur Marius.‚Äù
U||She called Marius by his name; he could not doubt that he was the person whom she wanted; but who was this girl? How did she know his name?
U||Without waiting for him to tell her to advance, she entered. She entered resolutely, staring, with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed, at the whole room and the unmade bed. Her feet were bare. Large holes in her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her thin knees. She was shivering.
U||She held a letter in her hand, which she presented to Marius.
U||Marius, as he opened the letter, noticed that the enormous wafer which sealed it was still moist. The message could not have come from a distance. He read:‚Äî
U||MY AMIABLE NEIGHBOR, YOUNG MAN: I have learned of your goodness to me, that you paid my rent six months ago. I bless you, young man. My eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two days, four persons and my spouse ill. If I am not deseaved in my opinion, I think I may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor.
U||    I am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the benefactors of humanity,‚Äî
U||JONDRETTE.
U||P.S. My eldest daughter will await your orders, dear Monsieur Marius.
U||This letter, coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which had occupied Marius‚Äô thoughts ever since the preceding evening, was like a candle in a cellar. All was suddenly illuminated.
U||This letter came from the same place as the other four. There was the same writing, the same style, the same orthography, the same paper, the same odor of tobacco.
U||There were five missives, five histories, five signatures, and a single signer. The Spanish Captain Don Alvar√®s, the unhappy Mistress Balizard, the dramatic poet Genflot, the old comedian Fabantou, were all four named Jondrette, if, indeed, Jondrette himself were named Jondrette.
U||Marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time, and he had had, as we have said, but very rare occasion to see, to even catch a glimpse of, his extremely mean neighbors. His mind was elsewhere, and where the mind is, there the eyes are also. He had been obliged more than once to pass the Jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs; but they were mere forms to him; he had paid so little heed to them, that, on the preceding evening, he had jostled the Jondrette girls on the boulevard, without recognizing them, for it had evidently been they, and it was with great difficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in him, in spite of disgust and pity, a vague recollection of having met her elsewhere.
U||Now he saw everything clearly. He understood that his neighbor Jondrette, in his distress, exercised the industry of speculating on the charity of benevolent persons, that he procured addresses, and that he wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy and compassionate, letters which his daughters delivered at their risk and peril, for this father had come to such a pass, that he risked his daughters; he was playing a game with fate, and he used them as the stake. Marius understood that probably, judging from their flight on the evening before, from their breathless condition, from their terror and from the words of slang which he had overheard, these unfortunate creatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession, and that the result of the whole was, in the midst of human society, as it is now constituted, two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women, a species of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery.
U||Sad creatures, without name, or sex, or age, to whom neither good nor evil were any longer possible, and who, on emerging from childhood, have already nothing in this world, neither liberty, nor virtue, nor responsibility. Souls which blossomed out yesterday, and are faded to-day, like those flowers let fall in the streets, which are soiled with every sort of mire, while waiting for some wheel to crush them. Nevertheless, while Marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her, the young girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the audacity of a spectre. She kicked about, without troubling herself as to her nakedness. Occasionally her chemise, which was untied and torn, fell almost to her waist. She moved the chairs about, she disarranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode, she handled Marius‚Äô clothes, she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners.
U||‚ÄúHullo!‚Äù said she, ‚Äúyou have a mirror!‚Äù
U||And she hummed scraps of vaudevilles, as though she had been alone, frolicsome refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice rendered lugubrious.
U||An indescribable constraint, weariness, and humiliation were perceptible beneath this hardihood. Effrontery is a disgrace.
U||Nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room, and, so to speak, flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened by the daylight, or which has broken its wing. One felt that under other conditions of education and destiny, the gay and over-free mien of this young girl might have turned out sweet and charming. Never, even among animals, does the creature born to be a dove change into an osprey. That is only to be seen among men.
U||Marius reflected, and allowed her to have her way.
U||She approached the table.
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù said she, ‚Äúbooks!‚Äù
U||A flash pierced her glassy eye. She resumed, and her accent expressed the happiness which she felt in boasting of something, to which no human creature is insensible:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI know how to read, I do!‚Äù
U||She eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table, and read with tolerable fluency:‚Äî
U||‚Äú‚ÄîGeneral Bauduin received orders to take the ch√¢teau of Hougomont which stands in the middle of the plain of Waterloo, with five battalions of his brigade.‚Äù
U||She paused.
U||‚ÄúAh! Waterloo! I know about that. It was a battle long ago. My father was there. My father has served in the armies. We are fine Bonapartists in our house, that we are! Waterloo was against the English.‚Äù
U||She laid down the book, caught up a pen, and exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd I know how to write, too!‚Äù
U||She dipped her pen in the ink, and turning to Marius:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDo you want to see? Look here, I‚Äôm going to write a word to show you.‚Äù
U||And before he had time to answer, she wrote on a sheet of white paper, which lay in the middle of the table: ‚ÄúThe bobbies are here.‚Äù
U||Then throwing down the pen:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThere are no faults of orthography. You can look. We have received an education, my sister and I. We have not always been as we are now. We were not made‚Äî‚Äù
U||Here she paused, fixed her dull eyes on Marius, and burst out laughing, saying, with an intonation which contained every form of anguish, stifled by every form of cynicism:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBah!‚Äù
U||And she began to hum these words to a gay air:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúJ‚Äôai faim, mon p√®re.‚Äù
U||Pas de fricot.
U||J‚Äôai froid, ma m√®re.
U||Pas de tricot.
U||    Grelotte,
U||    Lolotte!
U||    Sanglote,
U||    Jacquot!‚Äù
U||I am hungry, father.
U||I have no food.
U||I am cold, mother.
U||I have no clothes.
U||    Lolotte!
U||    Shiver,
U||    Sob,
U||    Jacquot!‚Äù
U||She had hardly finished this couplet, when she exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDo you ever go to the play, Monsieur Marius? I do. I have a little brother who is a friend of the artists, and who gives me tickets sometimes. But I don‚Äôt like the benches in the galleries. One is cramped and uncomfortable there. There are rough people there sometimes; and people who smell bad.‚Äù
U||Then she scrutinized Marius, assumed a singular air and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDo you know, Mr. Marius, that you are a very handsome fellow?‚Äù
U||And at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both, and made her smile and him blush. She stepped up to him, and laid her hand on his shoulder: ‚ÄúYou pay no heed to me, but I know you, Mr. Marius. I meet you here on the staircase, and then I often see you going to a person named Father Mabeuf who lives in the direction of Austerlitz, sometimes when I have been strolling in that quarter. It is very becoming to you to have your hair tumbled thus.‚Äù
U||She tried to render her voice soft, but only succeeded in making it very deep. A portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to her lips, as though on a piano where some notes are missing.
U||Marius had retreated gently.
U||‚ÄúMademoiselle,‚Äù said he, with his cool gravity, ‚ÄúI have here a package which belongs to you, I think. Permit me to return it to you.‚Äù
U||And he held out the envelope containing the four letters.
U||She clapped her hands and exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWe have been looking everywhere for that!‚Äù
U||Then she eagerly seized the package and opened the envelope, saying as she did so:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDieu de Dieu! how my sister and I have hunted! And it was you who found it! On the boulevard, was it not? It must have been on the boulevard? You see, we let it fall when we were running. It was that brat of a sister of mine who was so stupid. When we got home, we could not find it anywhere. As we did not wish to be beaten, as that is useless, as that is entirely useless, as that is absolutely useless, we said that we had carried the letters to the proper persons, and that they had said to us: ‚ÄòNix.‚Äô So here they are, those poor letters! And how did you find out that they belonged to me? Ah! yes, the writing. So it was you that we jostled as we passed last night. We couldn‚Äôt see. I said to my sister: ‚ÄòIs it a gentleman?‚Äô My sister said to me: ‚ÄòI think it is a gentleman.‚Äô‚Äù
U||In the meanwhile she had unfolded the petition addressed to ‚Äúthe benevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHere!‚Äù said she, ‚Äúthis is for that old fellow who goes to mass. By the way, this is his hour. I‚Äôll go and carry it to him. Perhaps he will give us something to breakfast on.‚Äù
U||Then she began to laugh again, and added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDo you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today? It will mean that we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday, our breakfast of yesterday, our dinner of to-day, and all that at once, and this morning. Come! Parbleu! if you are not satisfied, dogs, burst!‚Äù
U||This reminded Marius of the wretched girl‚Äôs errand to himself. He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket, and found nothing there.
U||The young girl went on, and seemed to have no consciousness of Marius‚Äô presence.
U||‚ÄúI often go off in the evening. Sometimes I don‚Äôt come home again. Last winter, before we came here, we lived under the arches of the bridges. We huddled together to keep from freezing. My little sister cried. How melancholy the water is! When I thought of drowning myself, I said to myself: ‚ÄòNo, it‚Äôs too cold.‚Äô I go out alone, whenever I choose, I sometimes sleep in the ditches. Do you know, at night, when I walk along the boulevard, I see the trees like forks, I see houses, all black and as big as Notre Dame, I fancy that the white walls are the river, I say to myself: ‚ÄòWhy, there‚Äôs water there!‚Äô The stars are like the lamps in illuminations, one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew them out, I am bewildered, as though horses were breathing in my ears; although it is night, I hear hand-organs and spinning-machines, and I don‚Äôt know what all. I think people are flinging stones at me, I flee without knowing whither, everything whirls and whirls. You feel very queer when you have
U|| had no food.‚Äù
U||And then she stared at him with a bewildered air.
U||By dint of searching and ransacking his pockets, Marius had finally collected five francs sixteen sous. This was all he owned in the world for the moment. ‚ÄúAt all events,‚Äù he thought, ‚Äúthere is my dinner for to-day, and to-morrow we will see.‚Äù He kept the sixteen sous, and handed the five francs to the young girl.
U||She seized the coin.
U||‚ÄúGood!‚Äù said she, ‚Äúthe sun is shining!‚Äù
U||And, as though the sun had possessed the property of melting the avalanches of slang in her brain, she went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFive francs! the shiner! a monarch! in this hole! Ain‚Äôt this fine! You‚Äôre a jolly thief! I‚Äôm your humble servant! Bravo for the good fellows! Two days‚Äô wine! and meat! and stew! we‚Äôll have a royal feast! and a good fill!‚Äù
U||She pulled her chemise up on her shoulders, made a low bow to Marius, then a familiar sign with her hand, and went towards the door, saying:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGood morning, sir. It‚Äôs all right. I‚Äôll go and find my old man.‚Äù
U||As she passed, she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode, which was moulding there amid the dust; she flung herself upon it and bit into it, muttering:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good! it‚Äôs hard! it breaks my teeth!‚Äù
U||Then she departed.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîA PROVIDENTIAL PEEP-HOLE
U||Marius had lived for five years in poverty, in destitution, even in distress, but he now perceived that he had not known real misery. True misery he had but just had a view of. It was its spectre which had just passed before his eyes. In fact, he who has only beheld the misery of man has seen nothing; the misery of woman is what he must see; he who has seen only the misery of woman has seen nothing; he must see the misery of the child.
U||When a man has reached his last extremity, he has reached his last resources at the same time. Woe to the defenceless beings who surround him! Work, wages, bread, fire, courage, good will, all fail him simultaneously. The light of day seems extinguished without, the moral light within; in these shadows man encounters the feebleness of the woman and the child, and bends them violently to ignominy.
U||Then all horrors become possible. Despair is surrounded with fragile partitions which all open on either vice or crime.
U||Health, youth, honor, all the shy delicacies of the young body, the heart, virginity, modesty, that epidermis of the soul, are manipulated in sinister wise by that fumbling which seeks resources, which encounters opprobrium, and which accommodates itself to it. Fathers, mothers, children, brothers, sisters, men, women, daughters, adhere and become incorporated, almost like a mineral formation, in that dusky promiscuousness of sexes, relationships, ages, infamies, and innocences. They crouch, back to back, in a sort of hut of fate. They exchange woe-begone glances. Oh, the unfortunate wretches! How pale they are! How cold they are! It seems as though they dwelt in a planet much further from the sun than ours.
U||This young girl was to Marius a sort of messenger from the realm of sad shadows. She revealed to him a hideous side of the night.
U||Marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of reverie and passion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up to that day. The payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement, which any one would have yielded to; but he, Marius, should have done better than that. What! only a wall separated him from those abandoned beings who lived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest of the world, he was elbow to elbow with them, he was, in some sort, the last link of the human race which they touched, he heard them live, or rather, rattle in the death agony beside him, and he paid no heed to them! Every day, every instant, he heard them walking on the other side of the wall, he heard them go, and come, and speak, and he did not even lend an ear! And groans lay in those words, and he did not even listen to them, his thoughts were elsewhere, given up to dreams, to impossible radiances, to loves in the air, to follies; and all the while, human creatures, his brothers in Jesus
U|| Christ, his brothers in the people, were agonizing in vain beside him! He even formed a part of their misfortune, and he aggravated it. For if they had had another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive, any ordinary and charitable man, evidently their indigence would have been noticed, their signals of distress would have been perceived, and they would have been taken hold of and rescued! They appeared very corrupt and very depraved, no doubt, very vile, very odious even; but those who fall without becoming degraded are rare; besides, there is a point where the unfortunate and the infamous unite and are confounded in a single word, a fatal word, the miserable; whose fault is this? And then should not the charity be all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?
U||While reading himself this moral lesson, for there were occasions on which Marius, like all truly honest hearts, was his own pedagogue and scolded himself more than he deserved, he stared at the wall which separated him from the Jondrettes, as though he were able to make his gaze, full of pity, penetrate that partition and warm these wretched people. The wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams, and, as the reader had just learned, it allowed the sound of voices and words to be clearly distinguished. Only a man as dreamy as Marius could have failed to perceive this long before. There was no paper pasted on the wall, either on the side of the Jondrettes or on that of Marius; the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness. Marius examined the partition, almost unconsciously; sometimes reverie examines, observes, and scrutinizes as thought would. All at once he sprang up; he had just perceived, near the top, close to the ceiling, a triangular hole, which resulted from the space between 
U||three lathes. The plaster which should have filled this cavity was missing, and by mounting on the commode, a view could be had through this aperture into the Jondrettes‚Äô attic. Commiseration has, and should have, its curiosity. This aperture formed a sort of peep-hole. It is permissible to gaze at misfortune like a traitor in order to succor it.27
U||‚ÄúLet us get some little idea of what these people are like,‚Äù thought Marius, ‚Äúand in what condition they are.‚Äù
U||He climbed upon the commode, put his eye to the crevice, and looked.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîTHE WILD MAN IN HIS LAIR
U||Cities, like forests, have their caverns in which all the most wicked and formidable creatures which they contain conceal themselves. Only, in cities, that which thus conceals itself is ferocious, unclean, and petty, that is to say, ugly; in forests, that which conceals itself is ferocious, savage, and grand, that is to say, beautiful. Taking one lair with another, the beast‚Äôs is preferable to the man‚Äôs. Caverns are better than hovels.
U||What Marius now beheld was a hovel.
U||Marius was poor, and his chamber was poverty-stricken, but as his poverty was noble, his garret was neat. The den upon which his eye now rested was abject, dirty, fetid, pestiferous, mean, sordid. The only furniture consisted of a straw chair, an infirm table, some old bits of crockery, and in two of the corners, two indescribable pallets; all the light was furnished by a dormer window of four panes, draped with spiders‚Äô webs. Through this aperture there penetrated just enough light to make the face of a man appear like the face of a phantom. The walls had a leprous aspect, and were covered with seams and scars, like a visage disfigured by some horrible malady; a repulsive moisture exuded from them. Obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be distinguished upon them.
U||The chamber which Marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement; this one was neither tiled nor planked; its inhabitants stepped directly on the antique plaster of the hovel, which had grown black under the long-continued pressure of feet. Upon this uneven floor, where the dirt seemed to be fairly incrusted, and which possessed but one virginity, that of the broom, were capriciously grouped constellations of old shoes, socks, and repulsive rags; however, this room had a fireplace, so it was let for forty francs a year. There was every sort of thing in that fireplace, a brazier, a pot, broken boards, rags suspended from nails, a bird-cage, ashes, and even a little fire. Two brands were smouldering there in a melancholy way.
U||One thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was, that it was large. It had projections and angles and black holes, the lower sides of roofs, bays, and promontories. Hence horrible, unfathomable nooks where it seemed as though spiders as big as one‚Äôs fist, wood-lice as large as one‚Äôs foot, and perhaps even‚Äîwho knows?‚Äîsome monstrous human beings, must be hiding.
U||One of the pallets was near the door, the other near the window. One end of each touched the fireplace and faced Marius. In a corner near the aperture through which Marius was gazing, a colored engraving in a black frame was suspended to a nail on the wall, and at its bottom, in large letters, was the inscription: THE DREAM. This represented a sleeping woman, and a child, also asleep, the child on the woman‚Äôs lap, an eagle in a cloud, with a crown in his beak, and the woman thrusting the crown away from the child‚Äôs head, without awaking the latter; in the background, Napoleon in a glory, leaning on a very blue column with a yellow capital ornamented with this inscription:
U||MARINGO
U||AUSTERLITS
U||IENA
U||WAGRAMME
U||ELOT
U||Beneath this frame, a sort of wooden panel, which was no longer than it was broad, stood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude against the wall. It had the appearance of a picture with its face turned to the wall, of a frame probably showing a daub on the other side, of some pier-glass detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waiting to be rehung.
U||Near the table, upon which Marius descried a pen, ink, and paper, sat a man about sixty years of age, small, thin, livid, haggard, with a cunning, cruel, and uneasy air; a hideous scoundrel.
U||If Lavater had studied this visage, he would have found the vulture mingled with the attorney there, the bird of prey and the pettifogger rendering each other mutually hideous and complementing each other; the pettifogger making the bird of prey ignoble, the bird of prey making the pettifogger horrible.
U||This man had a long gray beard. He was clad in a woman‚Äôs chemise, which allowed his hairy breast and his bare arms, bristling with gray hair, to be seen. Beneath this chemise, muddy trousers and boots through which his toes projected were visible.
U||He had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking. There was no bread in the hovel, but there was still tobacco.
U||He was writing probably some more letters like those which Marius had read.
U||On the corner of the table lay an ancient, dilapidated, reddish volume, and the size, which was the antique 12mo of reading-rooms, betrayed a romance. On the cover sprawled the following title, printed in large capitals:
U||GOD; THE KING; HONOR AND THE LADIES;
U||by
U||DUCRAY DUMINIL,
U||1814.
U||As the man wrote, he talked aloud, and Marius heard his words:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe idea that there is no equality, even when you are dead! Just look at P√®re-Lachaise! The great, those who are rich, are up above, in the acacia alley, which is paved. They can reach it in a carriage. The little people, the poor, the unhappy, well, what of them? they are put down below, where the mud is up to your knees, in the damp places. They are put there so that they will decay the sooner! You cannot go to see them without sinking into the earth.‚Äù
U||He paused, smote the table with his fist, and added, as he ground his teeth:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúOh! I could eat the whole world!‚Äù
U||A big woman, who might be forty years of age, or a hundred, was crouching near the fireplace on her bare heels.
U||She, too, was clad only in a chemise and a knitted petticoat patched with bits of old cloth. A coarse linen apron concealed the half of her petticoat. Although this woman was doubled up and bent together, it could be seen that she was of very lofty stature. She was a sort of giant, beside her husband. She had hideous hair, of a reddish blond which was turning gray, and which she thrust back from time to time, with her enormous shining hands, with their flat nails.
U||Beside her, on the floor, wide open, lay a book of the same form as the other, and probably a volume of the same romance.
U||On one of the pallets, Marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall pale young girl, who sat there half naked and with pendant feet, and who did not seem to be listening or seeing or living.
U||No doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room.
U||She seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age. On closer scrutiny it was evident that she really was fourteen. She was the child who had said, on the boulevard the evening before: ‚ÄúI bolted, bolted, bolted!‚Äù
U||She was of that puny sort which remains backward for a long time, then suddenly starts up rapidly. It is indigence which produces these melancholy human plants. These creatures have neither childhood nor youth. At fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve, at sixteen they seem twenty. To-day a little girl, to-morrow a woman. One might say that they stride through life, in order to get through with it the more speedily.
U||At this moment, this being had the air of a child.
U||Moreover, no trace of work was revealed in that dwelling; no handicraft, no spinning-wheel, not a tool. In one corner lay some ironmongery of dubious aspect. It was the dull listlessness which follows despair and precedes the death agony.
U||Marius gazed for a while at this gloomy interior, more terrifying than the interior of a tomb, for the human soul could be felt fluttering there, and life was palpitating there. The garret, the cellar, the lowly ditch where certain indigent wretches crawl at the very bottom of the social edifice, is not exactly the sepulchre, but only its antechamber; but, as the wealthy display their greatest magnificence at the entrance of their palaces, it seems that death, which stands directly side by side with them, places its greatest miseries in that vestibule.
U||The man held his peace, the woman spoke no word, the young girl did not even seem to breathe. The scratching of the pen on the paper was audible.
U||The man grumbled, without pausing in his writing. ‚ÄúCanaille! canaille! everybody is canaille!‚Äù
U||This variation to Solomon‚Äôs exclamation elicited a sigh from the woman.
U||‚ÄúCalm yourself, my little friend,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hurt yourself, my dear. You are too good to write to all those people, husband.‚Äù
U||Bodies press close to each other in misery, as in cold, but hearts draw apart. This woman must have loved this man, to all appearance, judging from the amount of love within her; but probably, in the daily and reciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress which weighed on the whole group, this had become extinct. There no longer existed in her anything more than the ashes of affection for her husband. Nevertheless, caressing appellations had survived, as is often the case. She called him: My dear, my little friend, my good man, etc., with her mouth while her heart was silent.
U||The man resumed his writing.
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîSTRATEGY AND TACTICS
U||Marius, with a load upon his breast, was on the point of descending from the species of observatory which he had improvised, when a sound attracted his attention and caused him to remain at his post.
U||The door of the attic had just burst open abruptly. The eldest girl made her appearance on the threshold. On her feet, she had large, coarse, men‚Äôs shoes, bespattered with mud, which had splashed even to her red ankles, and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in tatters. Marius had not seen it on her an hour previously, but she had probably deposited it at his door, in order that she might inspire the more pity, and had picked it up again on emerging. She entered, pushed the door to behind her, paused to take breath, for she was completely breathless, then exclaimed with an expression of triumph and joy:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHe is coming!‚Äù
U||The father turned his eyes towards her, the woman turned her head, the little sister did not stir.
U||‚ÄúWho?‚Äù demanded her father.
U||‚ÄúThe gentleman!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe philanthropist?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFrom the church of Saint-Jacques?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat old fellow?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd he is coming?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe is following me.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are sure?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am sure.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThere, truly, he is coming?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe is coming in a fiacre.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn a fiacre. He is Rothschild.‚Äù
U||The father rose.
U||‚ÄúHow are you sure? If he is coming in a fiacre, how is it that you arrive before him? You gave him our address at least? Did you tell him that it was the last door at the end of the corridor, on the right? If he only does not make a mistake! So you found him at the church? Did he read my letter? What did he say to you?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTa, ta, ta,‚Äù said the girl, ‚Äúhow you do gallop on, my good man! See here: I entered the church, he was in his usual place, I made him a reverence, and I handed him the letter; he read it and said to me: ‚ÄòWhere do you live, my child?‚Äô I said: ‚ÄòMonsieur, I will show you.‚Äô He said to me: ‚ÄòNo, give me your address, my daughter has some purchases to make, I will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that you do.‚Äô I gave him the address. When I mentioned the house, he seemed surprised and hesitated for an instant, then he said: ‚ÄòNever mind, I will come.‚Äô When the mass was finished, I watched him leave the church with his daughter, and I saw them enter a carriage. I certainly did tell him the last door in the corridor, on the right.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd what makes you think that he will come?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have just seen the fiacre turn into the Rue Petit-Banquier. That is what made me run so.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHow do you know that it was the same fiacre?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBecause I took notice of the number, so there!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat was the number?‚Äù
U||‚Äú440.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGood, you are a clever girl.‚Äù
U||The girl stared boldly at her father, and showing the shoes which she had on her feet:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúA clever girl, possibly; but I tell you I won‚Äôt put these shoes on again, and that I won‚Äôt, for the sake of my health, in the first place, and for the sake of cleanliness, in the next. I don‚Äôt know anything more irritating than shoes that squelch, and go ghi, ghi, ghi, the whole time. I prefer to go barefoot.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are right,‚Äù said her father, in a sweet tone which contrasted with the young girl‚Äôs rudeness, ‚Äúbut then, you will not be allowed to enter churches, for poor people must have shoes to do that. One cannot go barefoot to the good God,‚Äù he added bitterly.
U||Then, returning to the subject which absorbed him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSo you are sure that he will come?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe is following on my heels,‚Äù said she.
U||The man started up. A sort of illumination appeared on his countenance.
U||‚ÄúWife!‚Äù he exclaimed, ‚Äúyou hear. Here is the philanthropist. Extinguish the fire.‚Äù
U||The stupefied mother did not stir.
U||The father, with the agility of an acrobat, seized a broken-nosed jug which stood on the chimney, and flung the water on the brands.
U||Then, addressing his eldest daughter:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHere you! Pull the straw off that chair!‚Äù
U||His daughter did not understand.
U||He seized the chair, and with one kick he rendered it seatless. His leg passed through it.
U||As he withdrew his leg, he asked his daughter:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIs it cold?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúVery cold. It is snowing.‚Äù
U||The father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near the window, and shouted to her in a thundering voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúQuick! get off that bed, you lazy thing! will you never do anything? Break a pane of glass!‚Äù
U||The little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver.
U||‚ÄúBreak a pane!‚Äù he repeated.
U||The child stood still in bewilderment.
U||‚ÄúDo you hear me?‚Äù repeated her father, ‚ÄúI tell you to break a pane!‚Äù
U||The child, with a sort of terrified obedience, rose on tiptoe, and struck a pane with her fist. The glass broke and fell with a loud clatter.
U||‚ÄúGood,‚Äù said the father.
U||He was grave and abrupt. His glance swept rapidly over all the crannies of the garret. One would have said that he was a general making the final preparation at the moment when the battle is on the point of beginning.
U||The mother, who had not said a word so far, now rose and demanded in a dull, slow, languid voice, whence her words seemed to emerge in a congealed state:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat do you mean to do, my dear?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGet into bed,‚Äù replied the man.
U||His intonation admitted of no deliberation. The mother obeyed, and threw herself heavily on one of the pallets.
U||In the meantime, a sob became audible in one corner.
U||‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù cried the father.
U||The younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist, without quitting the corner in which she was cowering. She had wounded herself while breaking the window; she went off, near her mother‚Äôs pallet and wept silently.
U||It was now the mother‚Äôs turn to start up and exclaim:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúJust see there! What follies you commit! She has cut herself breaking that pane for you!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSo much the better!‚Äù said the man. ‚ÄúI foresaw that.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat? So much the better?‚Äù retorted his wife.
U||‚ÄúPeace!‚Äù replied the father, ‚ÄúI suppress the liberty of the press.‚Äù
U||Then tearing the woman‚Äôs chemise which he was wearing, he made a strip of cloth with which he hastily swathed the little girl‚Äôs bleeding wrist.
U||That done, his eye fell with a satisfied expression on his torn chemise.
U||‚ÄúAnd the chemise too,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúthis has a good appearance.‚Äù
U||An icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room. The outer mist penetrated thither and diffused itself like a whitish sheet of wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers. Through the broken pane the snow could be seen falling. The snow promised by the Candlemas sun of the preceding day had actually come.
U||The father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he had forgotten nothing. He seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the wet brands in such a manner as to entirely conceal them.
U||Then drawing himself up and leaning against the chimney-piece:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúNow,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúwe can receive the philanthropist.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîTHE RAY OF LIGHT IN THE HOVEL
U||The big girl approached and laid her hand in her father‚Äôs.
U||‚ÄúFeel how cold I am,‚Äù said she.
U||‚ÄúBah!‚Äù replied the father, ‚ÄúI am much colder than that.‚Äù
U||The mother exclaimed impetuously:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou always have something better than any one else, so you do! even bad things.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDown with you!‚Äù said the man.
U||The mother, being eyed after a certain fashion, held her tongue.
U||Silence reigned for a moment in the hovel. The elder girl was removing the mud from the bottom of her mantle, with a careless air; her younger sister continued to sob; the mother had taken the latter‚Äôs head between her hands, and was covering it with kisses, whispering to her the while:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMy treasure, I entreat you, it is nothing of consequence, don‚Äôt cry, you will anger your father.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo!‚Äù exclaimed the father, ‚Äúquite the contrary! sob! sob! that‚Äôs right.‚Äù
U||Then turning to the elder:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThere now! He is not coming! What if he were not to come! I shall have extinguished my fire, wrecked my chair, torn my shirt, and broken my pane all for nothing.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd wounded the child!‚Äù murmured the mother.
U||‚ÄúDo you know,‚Äù went on the father, ‚Äúthat it‚Äôs beastly cold in this devil‚Äôs garret! What if that man should not come! Oh! See there, you! He makes us wait! He says to himself: ‚ÄòWell! they will wait for me! That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre there for.‚Äô Oh! how I hate them, and with what joy, jubilation, enthusiasm, and satisfaction I could strangle all those rich folks! all those rich folks! These men who pretend to be charitable, who put on airs, who go to mass, who make presents to the priesthood, preachy, preachy, in their skullcaps, and who think themselves above us, and who come for the purpose of humiliating us, and to bring us ‚Äòclothes,‚Äô as they say! old duds that are not worth four sous! And bread! That‚Äôs not what I want, pack of rascals that they are, it‚Äôs money! Ah! money! Never! Because they say that we would go off and drink it up, and that we are drunkards and idlers! And they! What are they, then, and what have they been in their time! Thieves! They never could have become rich otherw
U||ise! Oh! Society ought to be grasped by the four corners of the cloth and tossed into the air, all of it! It would all be smashed, very likely, but at least, no one would have anything, and there would be that much gained! But what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing? Will he come? Perhaps the animal has forgotten the address! I‚Äôll bet that that old beast‚Äî‚Äù
U||At that moment there came a light tap at the door, the man rushed to it and opened it, exclaiming, amid profound bows and smiles of adoration:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúEnter, sir! Deign to enter, most respected benefactor, and your charming young lady, also.‚Äù
U||A man of ripe age and a young girl made their appearance on the threshold of the attic.
U||Marius had not quitted his post. His feelings for the moment surpassed the powers of the human tongue.
U||It was She!
U||Whoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained in those three letters of that word: She.
U||It was certainly she. Marius could hardly distinguish her through the luminous vapor which had suddenly spread before his eyes. It was that sweet, absent being, that star which had beamed upon him for six months; it was those eyes, that brow, that mouth, that lovely vanished face which had created night by its departure. The vision had been eclipsed, now it reappeared.
U||It reappeared in that gloom, in that garret, in that misshapen attic, in all that horror.
U||Marius shuddered in dismay. What! It was she! The palpitations of his heart troubled his sight. He felt that he was on the brink of bursting into tears! What! He beheld her again at last, after having sought her so long! It seemed to him that he had lost his soul, and that he had just found it again.
U||She was the same as ever, only a little pale; her delicate face was framed in a bonnet of violet velvet, her figure was concealed beneath a pelisse of black satin. Beneath her long dress, a glimpse could be caught of her tiny foot shod in a silken boot.
U||She was still accompanied by M. Leblanc.
U||She had taken a few steps into the room, and had deposited a tolerably bulky parcel on the table.
U||The eldest Jondrette girl had retired behind the door, and was staring with sombre eyes at that velvet bonnet, that silk mantle, and that charming, happy face.
U||CHAPTER IX‚ÄîJONDRETTE COMES NEAR WEEPING
U||The hovel was so dark, that people coming from without felt on entering it the effect produced on entering a cellar. The two newcomers advanced, therefore, with a certain hesitation, being hardly able to distinguish the vague forms surrounding them, while they could be clearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of the garret, who were accustomed to this twilight.
U||M. Leblanc approached, with his sad but kindly look, and said to Jondrette the father:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur, in this package you will find some new clothes and some woollen stockings and blankets.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOur angelic benefactor overwhelms us,‚Äù said Jondrette, bowing to the very earth.
U||Then, bending down to the ear of his eldest daughter, while the two visitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior, he added in a low and rapid voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHey? What did I say? Duds! No money! They are all alike! By the way, how was the letter to that old blockhead signed?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFabantou,‚Äù replied the girl.
U||‚ÄúThe dramatic artist, good!‚Äù
U||It was lucky for Jondrette, that this had occurred to him, for at the very moment, M. Leblanc turned to him, and said to him with the air of a person who is seeking to recall a name:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI see that you are greatly to be pitied, Monsieur‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFabantou,‚Äù replied Jondrette quickly.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Fabantou, yes, that is it. I remember.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDramatic artist, sir, and one who has had some success.‚Äù
U||Here Jondrette evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the ‚Äúphilanthropist.‚Äù He exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the same time of the vainglory of the mountebank at fairs, and the humility of the mendicant on the highway:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúA pupil of Talma! Sir! I am a pupil of Talma! Fortune formerly smiled on me‚ÄîAlas! Now it is misfortune‚Äôs turn. You see, my benefactor, no bread, no fire. My poor babes have no fire! My only chair has no seat! A broken pane! And in such weather! My spouse in bed! Ill!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPoor woman!‚Äù said M. Leblanc.
U||‚ÄúMy child wounded!‚Äù added Jondrette.
U||The child, diverted by the arrival of the strangers, had fallen to contemplating ‚Äúthe young lady,‚Äù and had ceased to sob.
U||‚ÄúCry! bawl!‚Äù said Jondrette to her in a low voice.
U||At the same time he pinched her sore hand. All this was done with the talent of a juggler.
U||The little girl gave vent to loud shrieks.
U||The adorable young girl, whom Marius, in his heart, called ‚Äúhis Ursule,‚Äù approached her hastily.
U||‚ÄúPoor, dear child!‚Äù said she.
U||‚ÄúYou see, my beautiful young lady,‚Äù pursued Jondrette ‚Äúher bleeding wrist! It came through an accident while working at a machine to earn six sous a day. It may be necessary to cut off her arm.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúReally?‚Äù said the old gentleman, in alarm.
U||The little girl, taking this seriously, fell to sobbing more violently than ever.
U||‚ÄúAlas! yes, my benefactor!‚Äù replied the father.
U||For several minutes, Jondrette had been scrutinizing ‚Äúthe benefactor‚Äù in a singular fashion. As he spoke, he seemed to be examining the other attentively, as though seeking to summon up his recollections. All at once, profiting by a moment when the newcomers were questioning the child with interest as to her injured hand, he passed near his wife, who lay in her bed with a stupid and dejected air, and said to her in a rapid but very low tone:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúTake a look at that man!‚Äù
U||Then, turning to M. Leblanc, and continuing his lamentations:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou see, sir! All the clothing that I have is my wife‚Äôs chemise! And all torn at that! In the depths of winter! I can‚Äôt go out for lack of a coat. If I had a coat of any sort, I would go and see Mademoiselle Mars, who knows me and is very fond of me. Does she not still reside in the Rue de la Tour-des-Dames? Do you know, sir? We played together in the provinces. I shared her laurels. C√©lim√®ne would come to my succor, sir! Elmire would bestow alms on B√©lisaire! But no, nothing! And not a sou in the house! My wife ill, and not a sou! My daughter dangerously injured, not a sou! My wife suffers from fits of suffocation. It comes from her age, and besides, her nervous system is affected. She ought to have assistance, and my daughter also! But the doctor! But the apothecary! How am I to pay them? I would kneel to a penny, sir! Such is the condition to which the arts are reduced. And do you know, my charming young lady, and you, my generous protector, do you know, you who breathe forth virtue and goodness
U||, and who perfume that church where my daughter sees you every day when she says her prayers?‚ÄîFor I have brought up my children religiously, sir. I did not want them to take to the theatre. Ah! the hussies! If I catch them tripping! I do not jest, that I don‚Äôt! I read them lessons on honor, on morality, on virtue! Ask them! They have got to walk straight. They are none of your unhappy wretches who begin by having no family, and end by espousing the public. One is Mamselle Nobody, and one becomes Madame Everybody. Deuce take it! None of that in the Fabantou family! I mean to bring them up virtuously, and they shall be honest, and nice, and believe in God, by the sacred name! Well, sir, my worthy sir, do you know what is going to happen to-morrow? To-morrow is the fourth day of February, the fatal day, the last day of grace allowed me by my landlord; if by this evening I have not paid my rent, to-morrow my oldest daughter, my spouse with her fever, my child with her wound,‚Äîwe shall all four be turned out
U|| of here and thrown into the street, on the boulevard, without shelter, in the rain, in the snow. There, sir. I owe for four quarters‚Äîa whole year! that is to say, sixty francs.‚Äù
U||Jondrette lied. Four quarters would have amounted to only forty francs, and he could not owe four, because six months had not elapsed since Marius had paid for two.
U||M. Leblanc drew five francs from his pocket and threw them on the table.
U||Jondrette found time to mutter in the ear of his eldest daughter:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe scoundrel! What does he think I can do with his five francs? That won‚Äôt pay me for my chair and pane of glass! That‚Äôs what comes of incurring expenses!‚Äù
U||In the meanwhile, M. Leblanc had removed the large brown great-coat which he wore over his blue coat, and had thrown it over the back of the chair.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Fabantou,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthese five francs are all that I have about me, but I shall now take my daughter home, and I will return this evening,‚Äîit is this evening that you must pay, is it not?‚Äù
U||Jondrette‚Äôs face lighted up with a strange expression. He replied vivaciously:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYes, respected sir. At eight o‚Äôclock, I must be at my landlord‚Äôs.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will be here at six, and I will fetch you the sixty francs.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMy benefactor!‚Äù exclaimed Jondrette, overwhelmed. And he added, in a low tone: ‚ÄúTake a good look at him, wife!‚Äù
U||M. Leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl, once more, and had turned towards the door.
U||‚ÄúFarewell until this evening, my friends!‚Äù said he.
U||‚ÄúSix o‚Äôclock?‚Äù said Jondrette.
U||‚ÄúSix o‚Äôclock precisely.‚Äù
U||At that moment, the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of the elder Jondrette girl.
U||‚ÄúYou are forgetting your coat, sir,‚Äù said she.
U||Jondrette darted an annihilating look at his daughter, accompanied by a formidable shrug of the shoulders.
U||M. Leblanc turned back and said, with a smile:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI have not forgotten it, I am leaving it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúO my protector!‚Äù said Jondrette, ‚Äúmy august benefactor, I melt into tears! Permit me to accompany you to your carriage.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIf you come out,‚Äù answered M. Leblanc, ‚Äúput on this coat. It really is very cold.‚Äù
U||Jondrette did not need to be told twice. He hastily donned the brown great-coat. And all three went out, Jondrette preceding the two strangers.
U||CHAPTER X‚ÄîTARIFF OF LICENSED CABS: TWO FRANCS AN HOUR
U||Marius had lost nothing of this entire scene, and yet, in reality, had seen nothing. His eyes had remained fixed on the young girl, his heart had, so to speak, seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment of her very first step in that garret. During her entire stay there, he had lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material perceptions and precipitates the whole soul on a single point. He contemplated, not that girl, but that light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet bonnet. The star Sirius might have entered the room, and he would not have been any more dazzled.
U||While the young girl was engaged in opening the package, unfolding the clothing and the blankets, questioning the sick mother kindly, and the little injured girl tenderly, he watched her every movement, he sought to catch her words. He knew her eyes, her brow, her beauty, her form, her walk, he did not know the sound of her voice. He had once fancied that he had caught a few words at the Luxembourg, but he was not absolutely sure of the fact. He would have given ten years of his life to hear it, in order that he might bear away in his soul a little of that music. But everything was drowned in the lamentable exclamations and trumpet bursts of Jondrette. This added a touch of genuine wrath to Marius‚Äô ecstasy. He devoured her with his eyes. He could not believe that it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst of those vile creatures in that monstrous lair. It seemed to him that he beheld a humming-bird in the midst of toads.
U||When she took her departure, he had but one thought, to follow her, to cling to her trace, not to quit her until he learned where she lived, not to lose her again, at least, after having so miraculously re-discovered her. He leaped down from the commode and seized his hat. As he laid his hand on the lock of the door, and was on the point of opening it, a sudden reflection caused him to pause. The corridor was long, the staircase steep, Jondrette was talkative, M. Leblanc had, no doubt, not yet regained his carriage; if, on turning round in the corridor, or on the staircase, he were to catch sight of him, Marius, in that house, he would, evidently, take the alarm, and find means to escape from him again, and this time it would be final. What was he to do? Should he wait a little? But while he was waiting, the carriage might drive off. Marius was perplexed. At last he accepted the risk and quitted his room.
U||There was no one in the corridor. He hastened to the stairs. There was no one on the staircase. He descended in all haste, and reached the boulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, on its way back to Paris.
U||Marius rushed headlong in that direction. On arriving at the angle of the boulevard, he caught sight of the fiacre again, rapidly descending the Rue Mouffetard; the carriage was already a long way off, and there was no means of overtaking it; what! run after it? Impossible; and besides, the people in the carriage would assuredly notice an individual running at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre, and the father would recognize him. At that moment, wonderful and unprecedented good luck, Marius perceived an empty cab passing along the boulevard. There was but one thing to be done, to jump into this cab and follow the fiacre. That was sure, efficacious, and free from danger.
U||Marius made the driver a sign to halt, and called to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBy the hour?‚Äù
U||Marius wore no cravat, he had on his working-coat, which was destitute of buttons, his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom.
U||The driver halted, winked, and held out his left hand to Marius, rubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb.
U||‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù said Marius.
U||‚ÄúPay in advance,‚Äù said the coachman.
U||Marius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him.
U||‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù he demanded.
U||‚ÄúForty sous.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will pay on my return.‚Äù
U||The driver‚Äôs only reply was to whistle the air of La Palisse and to whip up his horse.
U||Marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air. For the lack of four and twenty sous, he was losing his joy, his happiness, his love! He had seen, and he was becoming blind again. He reflected bitterly, and it must be confessed, with profound regret, on the five francs which he had bestowed, that very morning, on that miserable girl. If he had had those five francs, he would have been saved, he would have been born again, he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness, he would have made his escape from isolation and spleen, from his widowed state; he might have re-knotted the black thread of his destiny to that beautiful golden thread, which had just floated before his eyes and had broken at the same instant, once more! He returned to his hovel in despair.
U||He might have told himself that M. Leblanc had promised to return in the evening, and that all he had to do was to set about the matter more skilfully, so that he might follow him on that occasion; but, in his contemplation, it is doubtful whether he had heard this.
U||As he was on the point of mounting the staircase, he perceived, on the other side of the boulevard, near the deserted wall skirting the Rue De la Barri√®re-des-Gobelins, Jondrette, wrapped in the ‚Äúphilanthropist‚Äôs‚Äù great-coat, engaged in conversation with one of those men of disquieting aspect who have been dubbed by common consent, prowlers of the barriers; people of equivocal face, of suspicious monologues, who present the air of having evil minds, and who generally sleep in the daytime, which suggests the supposition that they work by night.
U||These two men, standing there motionless and in conversation, in the snow which was falling in whirlwinds, formed a group that a policeman would surely have observed, but which Marius hardly noticed.
U||Still, in spite of his mournful preoccupation, he could not refrain from saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom Jondrette was talking resembled a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, whom Courfeyrac had once pointed out to him as a very dangerous nocturnal roamer. This man‚Äôs name the reader has learned in the preceding book. This Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, figured later on in many criminal trials, and became a notorious rascal. He was at that time only a famous rascal. To-day he exists in the state of tradition among ruffians and assassins. He was at the head of a school towards the end of the last reign. And in the evening, at nightfall, at the hour when groups form and talk in whispers, he was discussed at La Force in the Fosse-aux-Lions. One might even, in that prison, precisely at the spot where the sewer which served the unprecedented escape, in broad daylight, of thirty prisoners, in 1843, passes under the culvert, read his name, PANCHAUD, 
U||audaciously carved by his own hand on the wall of the sewer, during one of his attempts at flight. In 1832, the police already had their eye on him, but he had not as yet made a serious beginning.
U||CHAPTER XI‚ÄîOFFERS OF SERVICE FROM MISERY TO WRETCHEDNESS
U||Marius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps; at the moment when he was about to re-enter his cell, he caught sight of the elder Jondrette girl following him through the corridor. The very sight of this girl was odious to him; it was she who had his five francs, it was too late to demand them back, the cab was no longer there, the fiacre was far away. Moreover, she would not have given them back. As for questioning her about the residence of the persons who had just been there, that was useless; it was evident that she did not know, since the letter signed Fabantou had been addressed ‚Äúto the benevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.‚Äù
U||Marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him.
U||It did not close; he turned round and beheld a hand which held the door half open.
U||‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù he asked, ‚Äúwho is there?‚Äù
U||It was the Jondrette girl.
U||‚ÄúIs it you?‚Äù resumed Marius almost harshly, ‚Äústill you! What do you want with me?‚Äù
U||She appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him. She no longer had the air of assurance which had characterized her that morning. She did not enter, but held back in the darkness of the corridor, where Marius could see her through the half-open door.
U||‚ÄúCome now, will you answer?‚Äù cried Marius. ‚ÄúWhat do you want with me?‚Äù
U||She raised her dull eyes, in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker vaguely, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Marius, you look sad. What is the matter with you?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWith me!‚Äù said Marius.
U||‚ÄúYes, you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThere is nothing the matter with me.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes, there is!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI tell you there is!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúLet me alone!‚Äù
U||Marius gave the door another push, but she retained her hold on it.
U||‚ÄúStop,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúyou are in the wrong. Although you are not rich, you were kind this morning. Be so again now. You gave me something to eat, now tell me what ails you. You are grieved, that is plain. I do not want you to be grieved. What can be done for it? Can I be of any service? Employ me. I do not ask for your secrets, you need not tell them to me, but I may be of use, nevertheless. I may be able to help you, since I help my father. When it is necessary to carry letters, to go to houses, to inquire from door to door, to find out an address, to follow any one, I am of service. Well, you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with you, and I will go and speak to the persons; sometimes it is enough if some one speaks to the persons, that suffices to let them understand matters, and everything comes right. Make use of me.‚Äù
U||An idea flashed across Marius‚Äô mind. What branch does one disdain when one feels that one is falling?
U||He drew near to the Jondrette girl.
U||‚ÄúListen‚Äî‚Äù he said to her.
U||She interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes.
U||‚ÄúOh yes, do call me thou! I like that better.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he resumed, ‚Äúthou hast brought hither that old gentleman and his daughter!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDost thou know their address?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFind it for me.‚Äù
U||The Jondrette‚Äôs dull eyes had grown joyous, and they now became gloomy.
U||‚ÄúIs that what you want?‚Äù she demanded.
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDo you know them?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is to say,‚Äù she resumed quickly, ‚Äúyou do not know her, but you wish to know her.‚Äù
U||This them which had turned into her had something indescribably significant and bitter about it.
U||‚ÄúWell, can you do it?‚Äù said Marius.
U||‚ÄúYou shall have the beautiful lady‚Äôs address.‚Äù
U||There was still a shade in the words ‚Äúthe beautiful lady‚Äù which troubled Marius. He resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúNever mind, after all, the address of the father and daughter. Their address, indeed!‚Äù
U||She gazed fixedly at him.
U||‚ÄúWhat will you give me?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnything you like.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnything I like?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou shall have the address.‚Äù
U||She dropped her head; then, with a brusque movement, she pulled to the door, which closed behind her.
U||Marius found himself alone.
U||He dropped into a chair, with his head and both elbows on his bed, absorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp, and as though a prey to vertigo. All that had taken place since the morning, the appearance of the angel, her disappearance, what that creature had just said to him, a gleam of hope floating in an immense despair,‚Äîthis was what filled his brain confusedly.
U||All at once he was violently aroused from his reverie.
U||He heard the shrill, hard voice of Jondrette utter these words, which were fraught with a strange interest for him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI tell you that I am sure of it, and that I recognized him.‚Äù
U||Of whom was Jondrette speaking? Whom had he recognized? M. Leblanc? The father of ‚Äúhis Ursule‚Äù? What! Did Jondrette know him? Was Marius about to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information without which his life was so dark to him? Was he about to learn at last who it was that he loved, who that young girl was? Who her father was? Was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being dispelled? Was the veil about to be rent? Ah! Heavens!
U||He bounded rather than climbed upon his commode, and resumed his post near the little peep-hole in the partition wall.
U||Again he beheld the interior of Jondrette‚Äôs hovel.
U||CHAPTER XII‚ÄîTHE USE MADE OF M. LEBLANC‚ÄôS FIVE-FRANC PIECE
U||Nothing in the aspect of the family was altered, except that the wife and daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings and jackets. Two new blankets were thrown across the two beds.
U||Jondrette had evidently just returned. He still had the breathlessness of out of doors. His daughters were seated on the floor near the fireplace, the elder engaged in dressing the younger‚Äôs wounded hand. His wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace, with a face indicative of astonishment. Jondrette was pacing up and down the garret with long strides. His eyes were extraordinary.
U||The woman, who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence of her husband, turned to say:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat, really? You are sure?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSure! Eight years have passed! But I recognize him! Ah! I recognize him. I knew him at once! What! Didn‚Äôt it force itself on you?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut I told you: ‚ÄòPay attention!‚Äô Why, it is his figure, it is his face, only older,‚Äîthere are people who do not grow old, I don‚Äôt know how they manage it,‚Äîit is the very sound of his voice. He is better dressed, that is all! Ah! you mysterious old devil, I‚Äôve got you, that I have!‚Äù
U||He paused, and said to his daughters:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGet out of here, you!‚ÄîIt‚Äôs queer that it didn‚Äôt strike you!‚Äù
U||They arose to obey.
U||The mother stammered:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWith her injured hand.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe air will do it good,‚Äù said Jondrette. ‚ÄúBe off.‚Äù
U||It was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to reply. The two girls departed.
U||At the moment when they were about to pass through the door, the father detained the elder by the arm, and said to her with a peculiar accent:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou will be here at five o‚Äôclock precisely. Both of you. I shall need you.‚Äù
U||Marius redoubled his attention.
U||On being left alone with his wife, Jondrette began to pace the room again, and made the tour of it two or three times in silence. Then he spent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the woman‚Äôs chemise which he wore into his trousers.
U||All at once, he turned to the female Jondrette, folded his arms and exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd would you like to have me tell you something? The young lady‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell, what?‚Äù retorted his wife, ‚Äúthe young lady?‚Äù
U||Marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking. He listened with ardent anxiety. His whole life was in his ears.
U||But Jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper. Then he straightened himself up and concluded aloud:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt is she!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat one?‚Äù said his wife.
U||‚ÄúThat very one,‚Äù said the husband.
U||No expression can reproduce the significance of the mother‚Äôs words. Surprise, rage, hate, wrath, were mingled and combined in one monstrous intonation. The pronunciation of a few words, the name, no doubt, which her husband had whispered in her ear, had sufficed to rouse this huge, somnolent woman, and from being repulsive she became terrible.
U||‚ÄúIt is not possible!‚Äù she cried. ‚ÄúWhen I think that my daughters are going barefoot, and have not a gown to their backs! What! A satin pelisse, a velvet bonnet, boots, and everything; more than two hundred francs‚Äô worth of clothes! so that one would think she was a lady! No, you are mistaken! Why, in the first place, the other was hideous, and this one is not so bad-looking! She really is not bad-looking! It can‚Äôt be she!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI tell you that it is she. You will see.‚Äù
U||At this absolute assertion, the Jondrette woman raised her large, red, blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression. At that moment, she seemed to Marius even more to be feared than her husband. She was a sow with the look of a tigress.
U||‚ÄúWhat!‚Äù she resumed, ‚Äúthat horrible, beautiful young lady, who gazed at my daughters with an air of pity,‚Äîshe is that beggar brat! Oh! I should like to kick her stomach in for her!‚Äù
U||She sprang off of the bed, and remained standing for a moment, her hair in disorder, her nostrils dilating, her mouth half open, her fists clenched and drawn back. Then she fell back on the bed once more. The man paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female.
U||After a silence lasting several minutes, he approached the female Jondrette, and halted in front of her, with folded arms, as he had done a moment before:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd shall I tell you another thing?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù she asked.
U||He answered in a low, curt voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMy fortune is made.‚Äù
U||The woman stared at him with the look that signifies: ‚ÄúIs the person who is addressing me on the point of going mad?‚Äù
U||He went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThunder! It was not so very long ago that I was a parishioner of the parish of die-of-hunger-if-you-have-a-fire,-die-of-cold-if-you-have-bread! I have had enough of misery! my share and other people‚Äôs share! I am not joking any longer, I don‚Äôt find it comic any more, I‚Äôve had enough of puns, good God! no more farces, Eternal Father! I want to eat till I am full, I want to drink my fill! to gormandize! to sleep! to do nothing! I want to have my turn, so I do, come now! before I die! I want to be a bit of a millionnaire!‚Äù
U||He took a turn round the hovel, and added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLike other people.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that?‚Äù asked the woman.
U||He shook his head, winked, screwed up one eye, and raised his voice like a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat do I mean by that? Listen!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHush!‚Äù muttered the woman, ‚Äúnot so loud! These are matters which must not be overheard.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBah! Who‚Äôs here? Our neighbor? I saw him go out a little while ago. Besides, he doesn‚Äôt listen, the big booby. And I tell you that I saw him go out.‚Äù
U||Nevertheless, by a sort of instinct, Jondrette lowered his voice, although not sufficiently to prevent Marius hearing his words. One favorable circumstance, which enabled Marius not to lose a word of this conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles on the boulevard.
U||This is what Marius heard:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúListen carefully. The Cr≈ìsus is caught, or as good as caught! That‚Äôs all settled already. Everything is arranged. I have seen some people. He will come here this evening at six o‚Äôclock. To bring sixty francs, the rascal! Did you notice how I played that game on him, my sixty francs, my landlord, my fourth of February? I don‚Äôt even owe for one quarter! Isn‚Äôt he a fool! So he will come at six o‚Äôclock! That‚Äôs the hour when our neighbor goes to his dinner. Mother Bougon is off washing dishes in the city. There‚Äôs not a soul in the house. The neighbor never comes home until eleven o‚Äôclock. The children shall stand on watch. You shall help us. He will give in.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd what if he does not give in?‚Äù demanded his wife.
U||Jondrette made a sinister gesture, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWe‚Äôll fix him.‚Äù
U||And he burst out laughing.
U||This was the first time Marius had seen him laugh. The laugh was cold and sweet, and provoked a shudder.
U||Jondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace, and drew from it an old cap, which he placed on his head, after brushing it with his sleeve.
U||‚ÄúNow,‚Äù said he, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going out. I have some more people that I must see. Good ones. You‚Äôll see how well the whole thing will work. I shall be away as short a time as possible, it‚Äôs a fine stroke of business, do you look after the house.‚Äù
U||And with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers, he stood for a moment in thought, then exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDo you know, it‚Äôs mighty lucky, by the way, that he didn‚Äôt recognize me! If he had recognized me on his side, he would not have come back again. He would have slipped through our fingers! It was my beard that saved us! my romantic beard! my pretty little romantic beard!‚Äù
U||And again he broke into a laugh.
U||He stepped to the window. The snow was still falling, and streaking the gray of the sky.
U||‚ÄúWhat beastly weather!‚Äù said he.
U||Then lapping his overcoat across his breast:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThis rind is too large for me. Never mind,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúhe did a devilish good thing in leaving it for me, the old scoundrel! If it hadn‚Äôt been for that, I couldn‚Äôt have gone out, and everything would have gone wrong! What small points things hang on, anyway!‚Äù
U||And pulling his cap down over his eyes, he quitted the room.
U||He had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door, when the door opened again, and his savage but intelligent face made its appearance once more in the opening.
U||‚ÄúI came near forgetting,‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúYou are to have a brazier of charcoal ready.‚Äù
U||And he flung into his wife‚Äôs apron the five-franc piece which the ‚Äúphilanthropist‚Äù had left with him.
U||‚ÄúA brazier of charcoal?‚Äù asked his wife.
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHow many bushels?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTwo good ones.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat will come to thirty sous. With the rest I will buy something for dinner.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe devil, no.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go and spend the hundred-sou piece.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBecause I shall have to buy something, too.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSomething.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHow much shall you need?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhereabouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmonger‚Äôs shop?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúRue Mouffetard.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh! yes, at the corner of a street; I can see the shop.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut tell me how much you will need for what you have to purchase?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFifty sous‚Äîthree francs.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThere won‚Äôt be much left for dinner.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúEating is not the point to-day. There‚Äôs something better to be done.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough, my jewel.‚Äù
U||At this word from his wife, Jondrette closed the door again, and this time, Marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel, and descend the staircase rapidly.
U||At that moment, one o‚Äôclock struck from the church of Saint-M√©dard.
U||CHAPTER XIII‚ÄîSOLUS CUM SOLO, IN LOCO REMOTO, NON COGITABUNTUR ORARE PATER NOSTER
U||Marius, dreamer as he was, was, as we have said, firm and energetic by nature. His habits of solitary meditation, while they had developed in him sympathy and compassion, had, perhaps, diminished the faculty for irritation, but had left intact the power of waxing indignant; he had the kindliness of a brahmin, and the severity of a judge; he took pity upon a toad, but he crushed a viper. Now, it was into a hole of vipers that his glance had just been directed, it was a nest of monsters that he had beneath his eyes.
U||‚ÄúThese wretches must be stamped upon,‚Äù said he.
U||Not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been elucidated; on the contrary, all of them had been rendered more dense, if anything; he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the Luxembourg and the man whom he called M. Leblanc, except that Jondrette was acquainted with them. Athwart the mysterious words which had been uttered, the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was the fact that an ambush was in course of preparation, a dark but terrible trap; that both of them were incurring great danger, she probably, her father certainly; that they must be saved; that the hideous plots of the Jondrettes must be thwarted, and the web of these spiders broken.
U||He scanned the female Jondrette for a moment. She had pulled an old sheet-iron stove from a corner, and she was rummaging among the old heap of iron.
U||He descended from the commode as softly as possible, taking care not to make the least noise. Amid his terror as to what was in preparation, and in the horror with which the Jondrettes had inspired him, he experienced a sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him perhaps to render a service to the one whom he loved.
U||But how was it to be done? How warn the persons threatened? He did not know their address. They had reappeared for an instant before his eyes, and had then plunged back again into the immense depths of Paris. Should he wait for M. Leblanc at the door that evening at six o‚Äôclock, at the moment of his arrival, and warn him of the trap? But Jondrette and his men would see him on the watch, the spot was lonely, they were stronger than he, they would devise means to seize him or to get him away, and the man whom Marius was anxious to save would be lost. One o‚Äôclock had just struck, the trap was to be sprung at six. Marius had five hours before him.
U||There was but one thing to be done.
U||He put on his decent coat, knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck, took his hat, and went out, without making any more noise than if he had been treading on moss with bare feet.
U||Moreover, the Jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron.
U||Once outside of the house, he made for the Rue du Petit-Banquier.
U||He had almost reached the middle of this street, near a very low wall which a man can easily step over at certain points, and which abuts on a waste space, and was walking slowly, in consequence of his preoccupied condition, and the snow deadened the sound of his steps; all at once he heard voices talking very close by. He turned his head, the street was deserted, there was not a soul in it, it was broad daylight, and yet he distinctly heard voices.
U||It occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting.
U||There, in fact, sat two men, flat on the snow, with their backs against the wall, talking together in subdued tones.
U||These two persons were strangers to him; one was a bearded man in a blouse, and the other a long-haired individual in rags. The bearded man had on a fez, the other‚Äôs head was bare, and the snow had lodged in his hair.
U||By thrusting his head over the wall, Marius could hear their remarks.
U||The hairy one jogged the other man‚Äôs elbow and said:‚Äî
U||‚Äú‚ÄîWith the assistance of Patron-Minette, it can‚Äôt fail.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDo you think so?‚Äù said the bearded man.
U||And the long-haired one began again:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as good as a warrant for each one, of five hundred balls, and the worst that can happen is five years, six years, ten years at the most!‚Äù
U||The other replied with some hesitation, and shivering beneath his fez:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a real thing. You can‚Äôt go against such things.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI tell you that the affair can‚Äôt go wrong,‚Äù resumed the long-haired man. ‚ÄúFather What‚Äôs-his-name‚Äôs team will be already harnessed.‚Äù
U||Then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the preceding evening at the Ga√Æt√© Theatre.
U||Marius went his way.
U||It seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men, so strangely hidden behind that wall, and crouching in the snow, could not but bear some relation to Jondrette‚Äôs abominable projects. That must be the affair.
U||He directed his course towards the faubourg Saint-Marceau and asked at the first shop he came to where he could find a commissary of police.
U||He was directed to Rue de Pontoise, No. 14.
U||Thither Marius betook himself.
U||As he passed a baker‚Äôs shop, he bought a two-penny roll, and ate it, foreseeing that he should not dine.
U||On the way, he rendered justice to Providence. He reflected that had he not given his five francs to the Jondrette girl in the morning, he would have followed M. Leblanc‚Äôs fiacre, and consequently have remained ignorant of everything, and that there would have been no obstacle to the trap of the Jondrettes and that M. Leblanc would have been lost, and his daughter with him, no doubt.
U||CHAPTER XIV‚ÄîIN WHICH A POLICE AGENT BESTOWS TWO FISTFULS ON A LAWYER
U||On arriving at No. 14, Rue de Pontoise, he ascended to the first floor and inquired for the commissary of police.
U||‚ÄúThe commissary of police is not here,‚Äù said a clerk; ‚Äúbut there is an inspector who takes his place. Would you like to speak to him? Are you in haste?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Marius.
U||The clerk introduced him into the commissary‚Äôs office. There stood a tall man behind a grating, leaning against a stove, and holding up with both hands the tails of a vast topcoat, with three collars. His face was square, with a thin, firm mouth, thick, gray, and very ferocious whiskers, and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out. Of that glance it might have been well said, not that it penetrated, but that it searched.
U||This man‚Äôs air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible than Jondrette‚Äôs; the dog is, at times, no less terrible to meet than the wolf.
U||‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù he said to Marius, without adding ‚Äúmonsieur.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIs this Monsieur le Commissaire de Police?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe is absent. I am here in his stead.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe matter is very private.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThen speak.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd great haste is required.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThen speak quick.‚Äù
U||This calm, abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the same time. He inspired fear and confidence. Marius related the adventure to him: That a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by sight, was to be inveigled into a trap that very evening; that, as he occupied the room adjoining the den, he, Marius Pontmercy, a lawyer, had heard the whole plot through the partition; that the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain Jondrette; that there would be accomplices, probably some prowlers of the barriers, among others a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille; that Jondrette‚Äôs daughters were to lie in wait; that there was no way of warning the threatened man, since he did not even know his name; and that, finally, all this was to be carried out at six o‚Äôclock that evening, at the most deserted point of the Boulevard de l‚ÄôH√¥pital, in house No. 50-52.
U||At the sound of this number, the inspector raised his head, and said coldly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSo it is in the room at the end of the corridor?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPrecisely,‚Äù answered Marius, and he added: ‚ÄúAre you acquainted with that house?‚Äù
U||The inspector remained silent for a moment, then replied, as he warmed the heel of his boot at the door of the stove:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúApparently.‚Äù
U||He went on, muttering between his teeth, and not addressing Marius so much as his cravat:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúPatron-Minette must have had a hand in this.‚Äù
U||This word struck Marius.
U||‚ÄúPatron-Minette,‚Äù said he, ‚ÄúI did hear that word pronounced, in fact.‚Äù
U||And he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long-haired man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the Rue du Petit-Banquier.
U||The inspector muttered:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe long-haired man must be Brujon, and the bearded one Demi-Liard, alias Deux-Milliards.‚Äù
U||He had dropped his eyelids again, and became absorbed in thought.
U||‚ÄúAs for Father What‚Äôs-his-name, I think I recognize him. Here, I‚Äôve burned my coat. They always have too much fire in these cursed stoves. Number 50-52. Former property of Gorbeau.‚Äù
U||Then he glanced at Marius.
U||‚ÄúYou saw only that bearded and that long-haired man?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd Panchaud.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNor a big lump of matter, resembling an elephant in the Jardin des Plantes?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNor a scamp with the air of an old red tail?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAs for the fourth, no one sees him, not even his adjutants, clerks, and employees. It is not surprising that you did not see him.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo. Who are all those persons?‚Äù asked Marius.
U||The inspector answered:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBesides, this is not the time for them.‚Äù
U||He relapsed into silence, then resumed:‚Äî
U||‚Äú50-52. I know that barrack. Impossible to conceal ourselves inside it without the artists seeing us, and then they will get off simply by countermanding the vaudeville. They are so modest! An audience embarrasses them. None of that, none of that. I want to hear them sing and make them dance.‚Äù
U||This monologue concluded, he turned to Marius, and demanded, gazing at him intently the while:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAre you afraid?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOf what?‚Äù said Marius.
U||‚ÄúOf these men?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo more than yourself!‚Äù retorted Marius rudely, who had begun to notice that this police agent had not yet said ‚Äúmonsieur‚Äù to him.
U||The inspector stared still more intently at Marius, and continued with sententious solemnity:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThere, you speak like a brave man, and like an honest man. Courage does not fear crime, and honesty does not fear authority.‚Äù
U||Marius interrupted him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat is well, but what do you intend to do?‚Äù
U||The inspector contented himself with the remark:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe lodgers have pass-keys with which to get in at night. You must have one.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Marius.
U||‚ÄúHave you it about you?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGive it to me,‚Äù said the inspector.
U||Marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket, handed it to the inspector and added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIf you will take my advice, you will come in force.‚Äù
U||The inspector cast on Marius such a glance as Voltaire might have bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him; with one movement he plunged his hands, which were enormous, into the two immense pockets of his top-coat, and pulled out two small steel pistols, of the sort called ‚Äúknock-me-downs.‚Äù Then he presented them to Marius, saying rapidly, in a curt tone:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúTake these. Go home. Hide in your chamber, so that you may be supposed to have gone out. They are loaded. Each one carries two balls. You will keep watch; there is a hole in the wall, as you have informed me. These men will come. Leave them to their own devices for a time. When you think matters have reached a crisis, and that it is time to put a stop to them, fire a shot. Not too soon. The rest concerns me. A shot into the ceiling, the air, no matter where. Above all things, not too soon. Wait until they begin to put their project into execution; you are a lawyer; you know the proper point.‚Äù Marius took the pistols and put them in the side pocket of his coat.
U||‚ÄúThat makes a lump that can be seen,‚Äù said the inspector. ‚ÄúPut them in your trousers pocket.‚Äù
U||Marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets.
U||‚ÄúNow,‚Äù pursued the inspector, ‚Äúthere is not a minute more to be lost by any one. What time is it? Half-past two. Seven o‚Äôclock is the hour?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSix o‚Äôclock,‚Äù answered Marius.
U||‚ÄúI have plenty of time,‚Äù said the inspector, ‚Äúbut no more than enough. Don‚Äôt forget anything that I have said to you. Bang. A pistol shot.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúRest easy,‚Äù said Marius.
U||And as Marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out, the inspector called to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBy the way, if you have occasion for my services between now and then, come or send here. You will ask for Inspector Javert.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER XV‚ÄîJONDRETTE MAKES HIS PURCHASES
U||A few moments later, about three o‚Äôclock, Courfeyrac chanced to be passing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. The snow had redoubled in violence, and filled the air. Bossuet was just saying to Courfeyrac:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúOne would say, to see all these snow-flakes fall, that there was a plague of white butterflies in heaven.‚Äù All at once, Bossuet caught sight of Marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiar air.
U||‚ÄúHold!‚Äù said Bossuet. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Marius.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI saw him,‚Äù said Courfeyrac. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let‚Äôs speak to him.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe is busy.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWith what?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you see his air?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat air?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe has the air of a man who is following some one.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true,‚Äù said Bossuet.
U||‚ÄúJust see the eyes he is making!‚Äù said Courfeyrac.
U||‚ÄúBut who the deuce is he following?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSome fine, flowery bonneted wench! He‚Äôs in love.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut,‚Äù observed Bossuet, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any wench nor any flowery bonnet in the street. There‚Äôs not a woman round.‚Äù
U||Courfeyrac took a survey, and exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHe‚Äôs following a man!‚Äù
U||A man, in fact, wearing a gray cap, and whose gray beard could be distinguished, although they only saw his back, was walking along about twenty paces in advance of Marius.
U||This man was dressed in a great-coat which was perfectly new and too large for him, and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags and black with mud.
U||Bossuet burst out laughing.
U||‚ÄúWho is that man?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe?‚Äù retorted Courfeyrac, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a poet. Poets are very fond of wearing the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of France.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see where Marius will go,‚Äù said Bossuet; ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see where the man is going, let‚Äôs follow them, hey?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBossuet!‚Äù exclaimed Courfeyrac, ‚Äúeagle of Meaux! You are a prodigious brute. Follow a man who is following another man, indeed!‚Äù
U||They retraced their steps.
U||Marius had, in fact, seen Jondrette passing along the Rue Mouffetard, and was spying on his proceedings.
U||Jondrette walked straight ahead, without a suspicion that he was already held by a glance.
U||He quitted the Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him enter one of the most terrible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse; he remained there about a quarter of an hour, then returned to the Rue Mouffetard. He halted at an ironmonger‚Äôs shop, which then stood at the corner of the Rue Pierre-Lombard, and a few minutes later Marius saw him emerge from the shop, holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle, which he concealed beneath his great-coat. At the top of the Rue Petit-Gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the Rue du Petit-Banquier. The day was declining; the snow, which had ceased for a moment, had just begun again. Marius posted himself on the watch at the very corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, which was deserted, as usual, and did not follow Jondrette into it. It was lucky that he did so, for, on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where Marius had heard the long-haired man and the bearded man conversing, Jondrette turned round, made sure that no one was following him, did
U|| not see him, then sprang across the wall and disappeared.
U||The waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard of an ex-livery stable-keeper of bad repute, who had failed and who still kept a few old single-seated berlins under his sheds.
U||Marius thought that it would be wise to profit by Jondrette‚Äôs absence to return home; moreover, it was growing late; every evening, Ma‚Äôam Bougon when she set out for her dish-washing in town, had a habit of locking the door, which was always closed at dusk. Marius had given his key to the inspector of police; it was important, therefore, that he should make haste.
U||Evening had arrived, night had almost closed in; on the horizon and in the immensity of space, there remained but one spot illuminated by the sun, and that was the moon.
U||It was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of Salp√™tri√®re.
U||Marius returned to No. 50-52 with great strides. The door was still open when he arrived. He mounted the stairs on tip-toe and glided along the wall of the corridor to his chamber. This corridor, as the reader will remember, was bordered on both sides by attics, all of which were, for the moment, empty and to let. Ma‚Äôam Bougon was in the habit of leaving all the doors open. As he passed one of these attics, Marius thought he perceived in the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of four men, vaguely lighted up by a remnant of daylight, falling through a dormer window.
U||Marius made no attempt to see, not wishing to be seen himself. He succeeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without making any noise. It was high time. A moment later he heard Ma‚Äôam Bougon take her departure, locking the door of the house behind her.
U||CHAPTER XVI‚ÄîIN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE WORDS TO AN ENGLISH AIR WHICH WAS IN FASHION IN 1832
U||Marius seated himself on his bed. It might have been half-past five o‚Äôclock. Only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen. He heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch in the dark. He thought of the double march which was going on at that moment in the dark,‚Äîcrime advancing on one side, justice coming up on the other. He was not afraid, but he could not think without a shudder of what was about to take place. As is the case with all those who are suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure, the entire day produced upon him the effect of a dream, and in order to persuade himself that he was not the prey of a nightmare, he had to feel the cold barrels of the steel pistols in his trousers pockets.
U||It was no longer snowing; the moon disengaged itself more and more clearly from the mist, and its light, mingled with the white reflection of the snow which had fallen, communicated to the chamber a sort of twilight aspect.
U||There was a light in the Jondrette den. Marius saw the hole in the wall shining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to him.
U||It was true that the light could not be produced by a candle. However, there was not a sound in the Jondrette quarters, not a soul was moving there, not a soul speaking, not a breath; the silence was glacial and profound, and had it not been for that light, he might have thought himself next door to a sepulchre.
U||Marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed.
U||Several minutes elapsed. Marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges; a heavy step mounted the staircase, and hastened along the corridor; the latch of the hovel was noisily lifted; it was Jondrette returning.
U||Instantly, several voices arose. The whole family was in the garret. Only, it had been silent in the master‚Äôs absence, like wolf whelps in the absence of the wolf.
U||‚ÄúIt‚Äôs I,‚Äù said he.
U||‚ÄúGood evening, daddy,‚Äù yelped the girls.
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù said the mother.
U||‚ÄúAll‚Äôs going first-rate,‚Äù responded Jondrette, ‚Äúbut my feet are beastly cold. Good! You have dressed up. You have done well! You must inspire confidence.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAll ready to go out.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget what I told you. You will do everything sure?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúRest easy.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBecause‚Äî‚Äù said Jondrette. And he left the phrase unfinished.
U||Marius heard him lay something heavy on the table, probably the chisel which he had purchased.
U||‚ÄúBy the way,‚Äù said Jondrette, ‚Äúhave you been eating here?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the mother. ‚ÄúI got three large potatoes and some salt. I took advantage of the fire to cook them.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGood,‚Äù returned Jondrette. ‚ÄúTo-morrow I will take you out to dine with me. We will have a duck and fixings. You shall dine like Charles the Tenth; all is going well!‚Äù
U||Then he added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe mouse-trap is open. The cats are there.‚Äù
U||He lowered his voice still further, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúPut this in the fire.‚Äù
U||Marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some iron utensil, and Jondrette continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHave you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied the mother.
U||‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNearly six. The half-hour struck from Saint-M√©dard a while ago.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe devil!‚Äù ejaculated Jondrette; ‚Äúthe children must go and watch. Come you, do you listen here.‚Äù
U||A whispering ensued.
U||Jondrette‚Äôs voice became audible again:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHas old Bougon left?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the mother.
U||‚ÄúAre you sure that there is no one in our neighbor‚Äôs room?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe has not been in all day, and you know very well that this is his dinner hour.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are sure?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSure.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAll the same,‚Äù said Jondrette, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no harm in going to see whether he is there. Here, my girl, take the candle and go there.‚Äù
U||Marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed.
U||Hardly had he concealed himself, when he perceived a light through the crack of his door.
U||‚ÄúP‚Äôpa,‚Äù cried a voice, ‚Äúhe is not in here.‚Äù
U||He recognized the voice of the eldest daughter.
U||‚ÄúDid you go in?‚Äù demanded her father.
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù replied the girl, ‚Äúbut as his key is in the door, he must be out.‚Äù
U||The father exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGo in, nevertheless.‚Äù
U||The door opened, and Marius saw the tall Jondrette come in with a candle in her hand. She was as she had been in the morning, only still more repulsive in this light.
U||She walked straight up to the bed. Marius endured an indescribable moment of anxiety; but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the wall, and it was thither that she was directing her steps. She raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it. In the neighboring room, the sound of iron articles being moved was audible.
U||She smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand, and smiled into the mirror, humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice:‚Äî
U||Nos amours ont dur√© toute une semaine,
U||Mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts!
U||S‚Äôadorer huit jours, c‚Äô√©tait bien la peine!
U||Le temps des amours devrait durer toujours!
U||Devrait durer toujours! devrait durer toujours!28
U||In the meantime, Marius trembled. It seemed impossible to him that she should not hear his breathing.
U||She stepped to the window and looked out with the half-foolish way she had.
U||‚ÄúHow ugly Paris is when it has put on a white chemise!‚Äù said she.
U||She returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it, scrutinizing herself full-face and three-quarters face in turn.
U||‚ÄúWell!‚Äù cried her father, ‚Äúwhat are you about there?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am looking under the bed and the furniture,‚Äù she replied, continuing to arrange her hair; ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no one here.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBooby!‚Äù yelled her father. ‚ÄúCome here this minute! And don‚Äôt waste any time about it!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúComing! Coming!‚Äù said she. ‚ÄúOne has no time for anything in this hovel!‚Äù
U||She hummed:‚Äî
U||Vous me quittez pour aller √† la gloire;
U||Mon triste c≈ìur suivra partout.29
U||She cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out, shutting the door behind her.
U||A moment more, and Marius heard the sound of the two young girls‚Äô bare feet in the corridor, and Jondrette‚Äôs voice shouting to them:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúPay strict heed! One on the side of the barrier, the other at the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier. Don‚Äôt lose sight for a moment of the door of this house, and the moment you see anything, rush here on the instant! as hard as you can go! You have a key to get in.‚Äù
U||The eldest girl grumbled:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo-morrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots!‚Äù said the father.
U||They ran downstairs, and a few seconds later the shock of the outer door as it banged to announced that they were outside.
U||There now remained in the house only Marius, the Jondrettes and probably, also, the mysterious persons of whom Marius had caught a glimpse in the twilight, behind the door of the unused attic.
U||CHAPTER XVII‚ÄîTHE USE MADE OF MARIUS‚Äô FIVE-FRANC PIECE
U||Marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his post at his observatory. In a twinkling, and with the agility of his age, he had reached the hole in the partition.
U||He looked.
U||The interior of the Jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect, and Marius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed. A candle was burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris, but that was not what really lighted the chamber. The hovel was completely illuminated, as it were, by the reflection from a rather large sheet-iron brazier standing in the fireplace, and filled with burning charcoal, the brazier prepared by the Jondrette woman that morning. The charcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red; a blue flame flickered over it, and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchased by Jondrette in the Rue Pierre-Lombard, where it had been thrust into the brazier to heat. In one corner, near the door, and as though prepared for some definite use, two heaps were visible, which appeared to be, the one a heap of old iron, the other a heap of ropes. All this would have caused the mind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation, to waver between a very sinister a
U||nd a very simple idea. The lair thus lighted up more resembled a forge than a mouth of hell, but Jondrette, in this light, had rather the air of a demon than of a smith.
U||The heat of the brazier was so great, that the candle on the table was melting on the side next the chafing-dish, and was drooping over. An old dark-lantern of copper, worthy of Diogenes turned Cartouche, stood on the chimney-piece.
U||The brazier, placed in the fireplace itself, beside the nearly extinct brands, sent its vapors up the chimney, and gave out no odor.
U||The moon, entering through the four panes of the window, cast its whiteness into the crimson and flaming garret; and to the poetic spirit of Marius, who was dreamy even in the moment of action, it was like a thought of heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries of earth.
U||A breath of air which made its way in through the open pane, helped to dissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of the brazier.
U||The Jondrette lair was, if the reader recalls what we have said of the Gorbeau building, admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent and sombre deed, and as the envelope for a crime. It was the most retired chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted boulevard in Paris. If the system of ambush and traps had not already existed, they would have been invented there.
U||The whole thickness of a house and a multitude of uninhabited rooms separated this den from the boulevard, and the only window that existed opened on waste lands enclosed with walls and palisades.
U||Jondrette had lighted his pipe, seated himself on the seatless chair, and was engaged in smoking. His wife was talking to him in a low tone.
U||If Marius had been Courfeyrac, that is to say, one of those men who laugh on every occasion in life, he would have burst with laughter when his gaze fell on the Jondrette woman. She had on a black bonnet with plumes not unlike the hats of the heralds-at-arms at the coronation of Charles X., an immense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat, and the man‚Äôs shoes which her daughter had scorned in the morning. It was this toilette which had extracted from Jondrette the exclamation: ‚ÄúGood! You have dressed up. You have done well. You must inspire confidence!‚Äù
U||As for Jondrette, he had not taken off the new surtout, which was too large for him, and which M. Leblanc had given him, and his costume continued to present that contrast of coat and trousers which constituted the ideal of a poet in Courfeyrac‚Äôs eyes.
U||All at once, Jondrette lifted up his voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBy the way! Now that I think of it. In this weather, he will come in a carriage. Light the lantern, take it and go downstairs. You will stand behind the lower door. The very moment that you hear the carriage stop, you will open the door, instantly, he will come up, you will light the staircase and the corridor, and when he enters here, you will go downstairs again as speedily as possible, you will pay the coachman, and dismiss the fiacre.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd the money?‚Äù inquired the woman.
U||Jondrette fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five francs.
U||‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù she exclaimed.
U||Jondrette replied with dignity:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning.‚Äù
U||And he added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDo you know what? Two chairs will be needed here.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat for?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo sit on.‚Äù
U||Marius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this mild answer from Jondrette.
U||‚ÄúPardieu! I‚Äôll go and get one of our neighbor‚Äôs.‚Äù
U||And with a rapid movement, she opened the door of the den, and went out into the corridor.
U||Marius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode, reach his bed, and conceal himself beneath it.
U||‚ÄúTake the candle,‚Äù cried Jondrette.
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúit would embarrass me, I have the two chairs to carry. There is moonlight.‚Äù
U||Marius heard Mother Jondrette‚Äôs heavy hand fumbling at his lock in the dark. The door opened. He remained nailed to the spot with the shock and with horror.
U||The Jondrette entered.
U||The dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight between two blocks of shadow. One of these blocks of shadow entirely covered the wall against which Marius was leaning, so that he disappeared within it.
U||Mother Jondrette raised her eyes, did not see Marius, took the two chairs, the only ones which Marius possessed, and went away, letting the door fall heavily to behind her.
U||She re-entered the lair.
U||‚ÄúHere are the two chairs.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd here is the lantern. Go down as quick as you can.‚Äù
U||She hastily obeyed, and Jondrette was left alone.
U||He placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table, turned the chisel in the brazier, set in front of the fireplace an old screen which masked the chafing-dish, then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope, and bent down as though to examine something. Marius then recognized the fact, that what he had taken for a shapeless mass was a very well-made rope-ladder, with wooden rungs and two hooks with which to attach it.
U||This ladder, and some large tools, veritable masses of iron, which were mingled with the old iron piled up behind the door, had not been in the Jondrette hovel in the morning, and had evidently been brought thither in the afternoon, during Marius‚Äô absence.
U||‚ÄúThose are the utensils of an edge-tool maker,‚Äù thought Marius.
U||Had Marius been a little more learned in this line, he would have recognized in what he took for the engines of an edge-tool maker, certain instruments which will force a lock or pick a lock, and others which will cut or slice, the two families of tools which burglars call cadets and fauchants.
U||The fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite Marius. The brazier being concealed, the only light in the room was now furnished by the candle; the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on the chimney-piece cast a large shadow. There was something indescribably calm, threatening, and hideous about this chamber. One felt that there existed in it the anticipation of something terrible.
U||Jondrette had allowed his pipe to go out, a serious sign of preoccupation, and had again seated himself. The candle brought out the fierce and the fine angles of his countenance. He indulged in scowls and in abrupt unfoldings of the right hand, as though he were responding to the last counsels of a sombre inward monologue. In the course of one of these dark replies which he was making to himself, he pulled the table drawer rapidly towards him, took out a long kitchen knife which was concealed there, and tried the edge of its blade on his nail. That done, he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it.
U||Marius, on his side, grasped the pistol in his right pocket, drew it out and cocked it.
U||The pistol emitted a sharp, clear click, as he cocked it.
U||Jondrette started, half rose, listened a moment, then began to laugh and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat a fool I am! It‚Äôs the partition cracking!‚Äù
U||Marius kept the pistol in his hand.
U||CHAPTER XVIII‚ÄîMARIUS‚Äô TWO CHAIRS FORM A VIS-A-VIS
U||Suddenly, the distant and melancholy vibration of a clock shook the panes. Six o‚Äôclock was striking from Saint-M√©dard.
U||Jondrette marked off each stroke with a toss of his head. When the sixth had struck, he snuffed the candle with his fingers.
U||Then he began to pace up and down the room, listened at the corridor, walked on again, then listened once more.
U||‚ÄúProvided only that he comes!‚Äù he muttered, then he returned to his chair.
U||He had hardly reseated himself when the door opened.
U||Mother Jondrette had opened it, and now remained in the corridor making a horrible, amiable grimace, which one of the holes of the dark-lantern illuminated from below.
U||‚ÄúEnter, sir,‚Äù she said.
U||‚ÄúEnter, my benefactor,‚Äù repeated Jondrette, rising hastily.
U||M. Leblanc made his appearance.
U||He wore an air of serenity which rendered him singularly venerable.
U||He laid four louis on the table.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Fabantou,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúthis is for your rent and your most pressing necessities. We will attend to the rest hereafter.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMay God requite it to you, my generous benefactor!‚Äù said Jondrette.
U||And rapidly approaching his wife:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDismiss the carriage!‚Äù
U||She slipped out while her husband was lavishing salutes and offering M. Leblanc a chair. An instant later she returned and whispered in his ear:‚Äî
U||‚Äú‚ÄôTis done.‚Äù
U||The snow, which had not ceased falling since the morning, was so deep that the arrival of the fiacre had not been audible, and they did not now hear its departure.
U||Meanwhile, M. Leblanc had seated himself.
U||Jondrette had taken possession of the other chair, facing M. Leblanc.
U||Now, in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow, let the reader picture to himself in his own mind, a cold night, the solitudes of the Salp√™tri√®re covered with snow and white as winding-sheets in the moonlight, the taper-like lights of the street lanterns which shone redly here and there along those tragic boulevards, and the long rows of black elms, not a passer-by for perhaps a quarter of a league around, the Gorbeau hovel, at its highest pitch of silence, of horror, and of darkness; in that building, in the midst of those solitudes, in the midst of that darkness, the vast Jondrette garret lighted by a single candle, and in that den two men seated at a table, M. Leblanc tranquil, Jondrette smiling and alarming, the Jondrette woman, the female wolf, in one corner, and, behind the partition, Marius, invisible, erect, not losing a word, not missing a single movement, his eye on the watch, and pistol in hand.
U||However, Marius experienced only an emotion of horror, but no fear. He clasped the stock of the pistol firmly and felt reassured. ‚ÄúI shall be able to stop that wretch whenever I please,‚Äù he thought.
U||He felt that the police were there somewhere in ambuscade, waiting for the signal agreed upon and ready to stretch out their arm.
U||Moreover, he was in hopes, that this violent encounter between Jondrette and M. Leblanc would cast some light on all the things which he was interested in learning.
U||CHAPTER XIX‚ÄîOCCUPYING ONE‚ÄôS SELF WITH OBSCURE DEPTHS
U||Hardly was M. Leblanc seated, when he turned his eyes towards the pallets, which were empty.
U||‚ÄúHow is the poor little wounded girl?‚Äù he inquired.
U||‚ÄúBad,‚Äù replied Jondrette with a heart-broken and grateful smile, ‚Äúvery bad, my worthy sir. Her elder sister has taken her to the Bourbe to have her hurt dressed. You will see them presently; they will be back immediately.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMadame Fabantou seems to me to be better,‚Äù went on M. Leblanc, casting his eyes on the eccentric costume of the Jondrette woman, as she stood between him and the door, as though already guarding the exit, and gazed at him in an attitude of menace and almost of combat.
U||‚ÄúShe is dying,‚Äù said Jondrette. ‚ÄúBut what do you expect, sir! She has so much courage, that woman has! She‚Äôs not a woman, she‚Äôs an ox.‚Äù
U||The Jondrette, touched by his compliment, deprecated it with the affected airs of a flattered monster.
U||‚ÄúYou are always too good to me, Monsieur Jondrette!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúJondrette!‚Äù said M. Leblanc, ‚ÄúI thought your name was Fabantou?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFabantou, alias Jondrette!‚Äù replied the husband hurriedly. ‚ÄúAn artistic sobriquet!‚Äù
U||And launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which M. Leblanc did not catch, he continued with an emphatic and caressing inflection of voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAh! we have had a happy life together, this poor darling and I! What would there be left for us if we had not that? We are so wretched, my respectable sir! We have arms, but there is no work! We have the will, no work! I don‚Äôt know how the government arranges that, but, on my word of honor, sir, I am not Jacobin, sir, I am not a bousingot.30 I don‚Äôt wish them any evil, but if I were the ministers, on my most sacred word, things would be different. Here, for instance, I wanted to have my girls taught the trade of paper-box makers. You will say to me: ‚ÄòWhat! a trade?‚Äô Yes! A trade! A simple trade! A bread-winner! What a fall, my benefactor! What a degradation, when one has been what we have been! Alas! There is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity! One thing only, a picture, of which I think a great deal, but which I am willing to part with, for I must live! Item, one must live!‚Äù
U||While Jondrette thus talked, with an apparent incoherence which detracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his physiognomy, Marius raised his eyes, and perceived at the other end of the room a person whom he had not seen before. A man had just entered, so softly that the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges. This man wore a violet knitted vest, which was old, worn, spotted, cut and gaping at every fold, wide trousers of cotton velvet, wooden shoes on his feet, no shirt, had his neck bare, his bare arms tattooed, and his face smeared with black. He had seated himself in silence on the nearest bed, and, as he was behind Jondrette, he could only be indistinctly seen.
U||That sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze, caused M. Leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as Marius. He could not refrain from a gesture of surprise which did not escape Jondrette.
U||‚ÄúAh! I see!‚Äù exclaimed Jondrette, buttoning up his coat with an air of complaisance, ‚Äúyou are looking at your overcoat? It fits me! My faith, but it fits me!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWho is that man?‚Äù said M. Leblanc.
U||‚ÄúHim?‚Äù ejaculated Jondrette, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a neighbor of mine. Don‚Äôt pay any attention to him.‚Äù
U||The neighbor was a singular-looking individual. However, manufactories of chemical products abound in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Many of the workmen might have black faces. Besides this, M. Leblanc‚Äôs whole person was expressive of candid and intrepid confidence.
U||He went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúExcuse me; what were you saying, M. Fabantou?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI was telling you, sir, and dear protector,‚Äù replied Jondrette placing his elbows on the table and contemplating M. Leblanc with steady and tender eyes, not unlike the eyes of the boa-constrictor, ‚ÄúI was telling you, that I have a picture to sell.‚Äù
U||A slight sound came from the door. A second man had just entered and seated himself on the bed, behind Jondrette.
U||Like the first, his arms were bare, and he had a mask of ink or lampblack.
U||Although this man had, literally, glided into the room, he had not been able to prevent M. Leblanc catching sight of him.
U||‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mind them,‚Äù said Jondrette, ‚Äúthey are people who belong in the house. So I was saying, that there remains in my possession a valuable picture. But stop, sir, take a look at it.‚Äù
U||He rose, went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we have already mentioned, and turned it round, still leaving it supported against the wall. It really was something which resembled a picture, and which the candle illuminated, somewhat. Marius could make nothing out of it, as Jondrette stood between the picture and him; he only saw a coarse daub, and a sort of principal personage colored with the harsh crudity of foreign canvasses and screen paintings.
U||‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù asked M. Leblanc.
U||Jondrette exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúA painting by a master, a picture of great value, my benefactor! I am as much attached to it as I am to my two daughters; it recalls souvenirs to me! But I have told you, and I will not take it back, that I am so wretched that I will part with it.‚Äù
U||Either by chance, or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness, M. Leblanc‚Äôs glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined the picture.
U||There were now four men, three seated on the bed, one standing near the door-post, all four with bare arms and motionless, with faces smeared with black. One of those on the bed was leaning against the wall, with closed eyes, and it might have been supposed that he was asleep. He was old; his white hair contrasting with his blackened face produced a horrible effect. The other two seemed to be young; one wore a beard, the other wore his hair long. None of them had on shoes; those who did not wear socks were barefooted.
U||Jondrette noticed that M. Leblanc‚Äôs eye was fixed on these men.
U||‚ÄúThey are friends. They are neighbors,‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúTheir faces are black because they work in charcoal. They are chimney-builders. Don‚Äôt trouble yourself about them, my benefactor, but buy my picture. Have pity on my misery. I will not ask you much for it. How much do you think it is worth?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said M. Leblanc, looking Jondrette full in the eye, and with the manner of a man who is on his guard, ‚Äúit is some signboard for a tavern, and is worth about three francs.‚Äù
U||Jondrette replied sweetly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHave you your pocket-book with you? I should be satisfied with a thousand crowns.‚Äù
U||M. Leblanc sprang up, placed his back against the wall, and cast a rapid glance around the room. He had Jondrette on his left, on the side next the window, and the Jondrette woman and the four men on his right, on the side next the door. The four men did not stir, and did not even seem to be looking on.
U||Jondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone, with so vague an eye, and so lamentable an intonation, that M. Leblanc might have supposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad with misery.
U||‚ÄúIf you do not buy my picture, my dear benefactor,‚Äù said Jondrette, ‚ÄúI shall be left without resources; there will be nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river. When I think that I wanted to have my two girls taught the middle-class paper-box trade, the making of boxes for New Year‚Äôs gifts! Well! A table with a board at the end to keep the glasses from falling off is required, then a special stove is needed, a pot with three compartments for the different degrees of strength of the paste, according as it is to be used for wood, paper, or stuff, a paring-knife to cut the cardboard, a mould to adjust it, a hammer to nail the steels, pincers, how the devil do I know what all? And all that in order to earn four sous a day! And you have to work fourteen hours a day! And each box passes through the workwoman‚Äôs hands thirteen times! And you can‚Äôt wet the paper! And you mustn‚Äôt spot anything! And you must keep the paste hot. The devil, I tell you! Four sous a day! How do you suppose a man 
U||is to live?‚Äù
U||As he spoke, Jondrette did not look at M. Leblanc, who was observing him. M. Leblanc‚Äôs eye was fixed on Jondrette, and Jondrette‚Äôs eye was fixed on the door. Marius‚Äô eager attention was transferred from one to the other. M. Leblanc seemed to be asking himself: ‚ÄúIs this man an idiot?‚Äù Jondrette repeated two or three distinct times, with all manner of varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order: ‚ÄúThere is nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river! I went down three steps at the side of the bridge of Austerlitz the other day for that purpose.‚Äù
U||All at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash; the little man drew himself up and became terrible, took a step toward M. Leblanc and cried in a voice of thunder: ‚ÄúThat has nothing to do with the question! Do you know me?‚Äù
U||CHAPTER XX‚ÄîTHE TRAP
U||The door of the garret had just opened abruptly, and allowed a view of three men clad in blue linen blouses, and masked with masks of black paper. The first was thin, and had a long, iron-tipped cudgel; the second, who was a sort of colossus, carried, by the middle of the handle, with the blade downward, a butcher‚Äôs pole-axe for slaughtering cattle. The third, a man with thick-set shoulders, not so slender as the first, held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some prison.
U||It appeared that the arrival of these men was what Jondrette had been waiting for. A rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the cudgel, the thin one.
U||‚ÄúIs everything ready?‚Äù said Jondrette.
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied the thin man.
U||‚ÄúWhere is Montparnasse?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe young principal actor stopped to chat with your girl.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhich?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe eldest.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIs there a carriage at the door?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIs the team harnessed?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWith two good horses?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúExcellent.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIs it waiting where I ordered?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGood,‚Äù said Jondrette.
U||M. Leblanc was very pale. He was scrutinizing everything around him in the den, like a man who understands what he has fallen into, and his head, directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him, moved on his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness, but there was nothing in his air which resembled fear. He had improvised an intrenchment out of the table; and the man, who but an instant previously, had borne merely the appearance of a kindly old man, had suddenly become a sort of athlete, and placed his robust fist on the back of his chair, with a formidable and surprising gesture.
U||This old man, who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such a danger, seemed to possess one of those natures which are as courageous as they are kind, both easily and simply. The father of a woman whom we love is never a stranger to us. Marius felt proud of that unknown man.
U||Three of the men, of whom Jondrette had said: ‚ÄúThey are chimney-builders,‚Äù had armed themselves from the pile of old iron, one with a heavy pair of shears, the second with weighing-tongs, the third with a hammer, and had placed themselves across the entrance without uttering a syllable. The old man had remained on the bed, and had merely opened his eyes. The Jondrette woman had seated herself beside him.
U||Marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention would arrive, and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling, in the direction of the corridor, in readiness to discharge his pistol.
U||Jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel, turned once more to M. Leblanc, and repeated his question, accompanying it with that low, repressed, and terrible laugh which was peculiar to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSo you do not recognize me?‚Äù
U||M. Leblanc looked him full in the face, and replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||Then Jondrette advanced to the table. He leaned across the candle, crossing his arms, putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to M. Leblanc‚Äôs calm face, and advancing as far as possible without forcing M. Leblanc to retreat, and, in this posture of a wild beast who is about to bite, he exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMy name is not Fabantou, my name is not Jondrette, my name is Th√©nardier. I am the inn-keeper of Montfermeil! Do you understand? Th√©nardier! Now do you know me?‚Äù
U||An almost imperceptible flush crossed M. Leblanc‚Äôs brow, and he replied with a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level, with his accustomed placidity:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúNo more than before.‚Äù
U||Marius did not hear this reply. Any one who had seen him at that moment through the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard, stupid, thunder-struck. At the moment when Jondrette said: ‚ÄúMy name is Th√©nardier,‚Äù Marius had trembled in every limb, and had leaned against the wall, as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his heart. Then his right arm, all ready to discharge the signal shot, dropped slowly, and at the moment when Jondrette repeated, ‚ÄúTh√©nardier, do you understand?‚Äù Marius‚Äôs faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol fall. Jondrette, by revealing his identity, had not moved M. Leblanc, but he had quite upset Marius. That name of Th√©nardier, with which M. Leblanc did not seem to be acquainted, Marius knew well. Let the reader recall what that name meant to him! That name he had worn on his heart, inscribed in his father‚Äôs testament! He bore it at the bottom of his mind, in the depths of his memory, in that sacred injunction: ‚ÄúA certain Th√©nardier saved 
U||my life. If my son encounters him, he will do him all the good that lies in his power.‚Äù That name, it will be remembered, was one of the pieties of his soul; he mingled it with the name of his father in his worship. What! This man was that Th√©nardier, that inn-keeper of Montfermeil whom he had so long and so vainly sought! He had found him at last, and how? His father‚Äôs saviour was a ruffian! That man, to whose service Marius was burning to devote himself, was a monster! That liberator of Colonel Pontmercy was on the point of committing a crime whose scope Marius did not, as yet, clearly comprehend, but which resembled an assassination! And against whom, great God! what a fatality! What a bitter mockery of fate! His father had commanded him from the depths of his coffin to do all the good in his power to this Th√©nardier, and for four years Marius had cherished no other thought than to acquit this debt of his father‚Äôs, and at the moment when he was on the eve of having a brigand seized in the very act
U|| of crime by justice, destiny cried to him: ‚ÄúThis is Th√©nardier!‚Äù He could at last repay this man for his father‚Äôs life, saved amid a hail-storm of grape-shot on the heroic field of Waterloo, and repay it with the scaffold! He had sworn to himself that if ever he found that Th√©nardier, he would address him only by throwing himself at his feet; and now he actually had found him, but it was only to deliver him over to the executioner! His father said to him: ‚ÄúSuccor Th√©nardier!‚Äù And he replied to that adored and sainted voice by crushing Th√©nardier! He was about to offer to his father in his grave the spectacle of that man who had torn him from death at the peril of his own life, executed on the Place Saint-Jacques through the means of his son, of that Marius to whom he had entrusted that man by his will! And what a mockery to have so long worn on his breast his father‚Äôs last commands, written in his own hand, only to act in so horribly contrary a sense! But, on the other hand, now look on that
U|| trap and not prevent it! Condemn the victim and to spare the assassin! Could one be held to any gratitude towards so miserable a wretch? All the ideas which Marius had cherished for the last four years were pierced through and through, as it were, by this unforeseen blow.
U||He shuddered. Everything depended on him. Unknown to themselves, he held in his hand all those beings who were moving about there before his eyes. If he fired his pistol, M. Leblanc was saved, and Th√©nardier lost; if he did not fire, M. Leblanc would be sacrificed, and, who knows? Th√©nardier would escape. Should he dash down the one or allow the other to fall? Remorse awaited him in either case.
U||What was he to do? What should he choose? Be false to the most imperious souvenirs, to all those solemn vows to himself, to the most sacred duty, to the most venerated text! Should he ignore his father‚Äôs testament, or allow the perpetration of a crime! On the one hand, it seemed to him that he heard ‚Äúhis Ursule‚Äù supplicating for her father and on the other, the colonel commending Th√©nardier to his care. He felt that he was going mad. His knees gave way beneath him. And he had not even the time for deliberation, so great was the fury with which the scene before his eyes was hastening to its catastrophe. It was like a whirlwind of which he had thought himself the master, and which was now sweeping him away. He was on the verge of swooning.
U||In the meantime, Th√©nardier, whom we shall henceforth call by no other name, was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy and wild triumph.
U||He seized the candle in his fist, and set it on the chimney-piece with so violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished, and the tallow bespattered the wall.
U||Then he turned to M. Leblanc with a horrible look, and spit out these words:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDone for! Smoked brown! Cooked! Spitchcocked!‚Äù
U||And again he began to march back and forth, in full eruption.
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù he cried, ‚Äúso I‚Äôve found you again at last, Mister philanthropist! Mister threadbare millionnaire! Mister giver of dolls! you old ninny! Ah! so you don‚Äôt recognize me! No, it wasn‚Äôt you who came to Montfermeil, to my inn, eight years ago, on Christmas eve, 1823! It wasn‚Äôt you who carried off that Fantine‚Äôs child from me! The Lark! It wasn‚Äôt you who had a yellow great-coat! No! Nor a package of duds in your hand, as you had this morning here! Say, wife, it seems to be his mania to carry packets of woollen stockings into houses! Old charity monger, get out with you! Are you a hosier, Mister millionnaire? You give away your stock in trade to the poor, holy man! What bosh! merry Andrew! Ah! and you don‚Äôt recognize me? Well, I recognize you, that I do! I recognized you the very moment you poked your snout in here. Ah! you‚Äôll find out presently, that it isn‚Äôt all roses to thrust yourself in that fashion into people‚Äôs houses, under the pretext that they are taverns, in wretched cloth
U||es, with the air of a poor man, to whom one would give a sou, to deceive persons, to play the generous, to take away their means of livelihood, and to make threats in the woods, and you can‚Äôt call things quits because afterwards, when people are ruined, you bring a coat that is too large, and two miserable hospital blankets, you old blackguard, you child-stealer!‚Äù
U||He paused, and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment. One would have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole, like the Rhone; then, as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been saying to himself in a whisper, he smote the table with his fist, and shouted:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd with his goody-goody air!‚Äù
U||And, apostrophizing M. Leblanc:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúParbleu! You made game of me in the past! You are the cause of all my misfortunes! For fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom I had, and who certainly belonged to rich people, and who had already brought in a great deal of money, and from whom I might have extracted enough to live on all my life! A girl who would have made up to me for everything that I lost in that vile cook-shop, where there was nothing but one continual row, and where, like a fool, I ate up my last farthing! Oh! I wish all the wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it! Well, never mind! Say, now! You must have thought me ridiculous when you went off with the Lark! You had your cudgel in the forest. You were the stronger. Revenge. I‚Äôm the one to hold the trumps to-day! You‚Äôre in a sorry case, my good fellow! Oh, but I can laugh! Really, I laugh! Didn‚Äôt he fall into the trap! I told him that I was an actor, that my name was Fabantou, that I had played comedy with Mamselle Mars, with Mamselle Muche, that
U|| my landlord insisted on being paid tomorrow, the 4th of February, and he didn‚Äôt even notice that the 8th of January, and not the 4th of February is the time when the quarter runs out! Absurd idiot! And the four miserable Philippes which he has brought me! Scoundrel! He hadn‚Äôt the heart even to go as high as a hundred francs! And how he swallowed my platitudes! That did amuse me. I said to myself: ‚ÄòBlockhead! Come, I‚Äôve got you! I lick your paws this morning, but I‚Äôll gnaw your heart this evening!‚Äô‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier paused. He was out of breath. His little, narrow chest panted like a forge bellows. His eyes were full of the ignoble happiness of a feeble, cruel, and cowardly creature, which finds that it can, at last, harass what it has feared, and insult what it has flattered, the joy of a dwarf who should be able to set his heel on the head of Goliath, the joy of a jackal which is beginning to rend a sick bull, so nearly dead that he can no longer defend himself, but sufficiently alive to suffer still.
U||M. Leblanc did not interrupt him, but said to him when he paused:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI do not know what you mean to say. You are mistaken in me. I am a very poor man, and anything but a millionnaire. I do not know you. You are mistaking me for some other person.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù roared Th√©nardier hoarsely, ‚Äúa pretty lie! You stick to that pleasantry, do you! You‚Äôre floundering, my old buck! Ah! You don‚Äôt remember! You don‚Äôt see who I am?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúExcuse me, sir,‚Äù said M. Leblanc with a politeness of accent, which at that moment seemed peculiarly strange and powerful, ‚ÄúI see that you are a villain!‚Äù
U||Who has not remarked the fact that odious creatures possess a susceptibility of their own, that monsters are ticklish! At this word ‚Äúvillain,‚Äù the female Th√©nardier sprang from the bed, Th√©nardier grasped his chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you stir!‚Äù he shouted to his wife; and, turning to M. Leblanc:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúVillain! Yes, I know that you call us that, you rich gentlemen! Stop! it‚Äôs true that I became bankrupt, that I am in hiding, that I have no bread, that I have not a single sou, that I am a villain! It‚Äôs three days since I have had anything to eat, so I‚Äôm a villain! Ah! you folks warm your feet, you have Sakoski boots, you have wadded great-coats, like archbishops, you lodge on the first floor in houses that have porters, you eat truffles, you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunch in the month of January, and green peas, you gorge yourselves, and when you want to know whether it is cold, you look in the papers to see what the engineer Chevalier‚Äôs thermometer says about it. We, it is we who are thermometers. We don‚Äôt need to go out and look on the quay at the corner of the Tour de l‚ÄôHorologe, to find out the number of degrees of cold; we feel our blood congealing in our veins, and the ice forming round our hearts, and we say: ‚ÄòThere is no God!‚Äô And you come to our caverns, yes our caverns,
U|| for the purpose of calling us villains! But we‚Äôll devour you! But we‚Äôll devour you, poor little things! Just see here, Mister millionnaire: I have been a solid man, I have held a license, I have been an elector, I am a bourgeois, that I am! And it‚Äôs quite possible that you are not!‚Äù
U||Here Th√©nardier took a step towards the men who stood near the door, and added with a shudder:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhen I think that he has dared to come here and talk to me like a cobbler!‚Äù
U||Then addressing M. Leblanc with a fresh outburst of frenzy:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd listen to this also, Mister philanthropist! I‚Äôm not a suspicious character, not a bit of it! I‚Äôm not a man whose name nobody knows, and who comes and abducts children from houses! I‚Äôm an old French soldier, I ought to have been decorated! I was at Waterloo, so I was! And in the battle I saved a general called the Comte of I don‚Äôt know what. He told me his name, but his beastly voice was so weak that I didn‚Äôt hear. All I caught was Merci [thanks]. I‚Äôd rather have had his name than his thanks. That would have helped me to find him again. The picture that you see here, and which was painted by David at Bruqueselles,‚Äîdo you know what it represents? It represents me. David wished to immortalize that feat of prowess. I have that general on my back, and I am carrying him through the grape-shot. There‚Äôs the history of it! That general never did a single thing for me; he was no better than the rest! But nonetheless, I saved his life at the risk of my own, and I have the certificate of the fact 
U||in my pocket! I am a soldier of Waterloo, by all the furies! And now that I have had the goodness to tell you all this, let‚Äôs have an end of it. I want money, I want a deal of money, I must have an enormous lot of money, or I‚Äôll exterminate you, by the thunder of the good God!‚Äù
U||Marius had regained some measure of control over his anguish, and was listening. The last possibility of doubt had just vanished. It certainly was the Th√©nardier of the will. Marius shuddered at that reproach of ingratitude directed against his father, and which he was on the point of so fatally justifying. His perplexity was redoubled.
U||Moreover, there was in all these words of Th√©nardier, in his accent, in his gesture, in his glance which darted flames at every word, there was, in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing everything, in that mixture of braggadocio and abjectness, of pride and pettiness, of rage and folly, in that chaos of real griefs and false sentiments, in that immodesty of a malicious man tasting the voluptuous delights of violence, in that shameless nudity of a repulsive soul, in that conflagration of all sufferings combined with all hatreds, something which was as hideous as evil, and as heart-rending as the truth.
U||The picture of the master, the painting by David which he had proposed that M. Leblanc should purchase, was nothing else, as the reader has divined, than the sign of his tavern painted, as it will be remembered, by himself, the only relic which he had preserved from his shipwreck at Montfermeil.
U||As he had ceased to intercept Marius‚Äô visual ray, Marius could examine this thing, and in the daub, he actually did recognize a battle, a background of smoke, and a man carrying another man. It was the group composed of Pontmercy and Th√©nardier; the sergeant the rescuer, the colonel rescued. Marius was like a drunken man; this picture restored his father to life in some sort; it was no longer the signboard of the wine-shop at Montfermeil, it was a resurrection; a tomb had yawned, a phantom had risen there. Marius heard his heart beating in his temples, he had the cannon of Waterloo in his ears, his bleeding father, vaguely depicted on that sinister panel terrified him, and it seemed to him that the misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him.
U||When Th√©nardier had recovered his breath, he turned his bloodshot eyes on M. Leblanc, and said to him in a low, curt voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you?‚Äù
U||M. Leblanc held his peace.
U||In the midst of this silence, a cracked voice launched this lugubrious sarcasm from the corridor:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs any wood to be split, I‚Äôm there!‚Äù
U||It was the man with the axe, who was growing merry.
U||At the same moment, an enormous, bristling, and clayey face made its appearance at the door, with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth, but fangs.
U||It was the face of the man with the butcher‚Äôs axe.
U||‚ÄúWhy have you taken off your mask?‚Äù cried Th√©nardier in a rage.
U||‚ÄúFor fun,‚Äù retorted the man.
U||For the last few minutes M. Leblanc had appeared to be watching and following all the movements of Th√©nardier, who, blinded and dazzled by his own rage, was stalking to and fro in the den with full confidence that the door was guarded, and of holding an unarmed man fast, he being armed himself, of being nine against one, supposing that the female Th√©nardier counted for but one man.
U||During his address to the man with the pole-axe, he had turned his back to M. Leblanc.
U||M. Leblanc seized this moment, overturned the chair with his foot and the table with his fist, and with one bound, with prodigious agility, before Th√©nardier had time to turn round, he had reached the window. To open it, to scale the frame, to bestride it, was the work of a second only. He was half out when six robust fists seized him and dragged him back energetically into the hovel. These were the three ‚Äúchimney-builders,‚Äù who had flung themselves upon him. At the same time the Th√©nardier woman had wound her hands in his hair.
U||At the trampling which ensued, the other ruffians rushed up from the corridor. The old man on the bed, who seemed under the influence of wine, descended from the pallet and came reeling up, with a stone-breaker‚Äôs hammer in his hand.
U||One of the ‚Äúchimney-builders,‚Äù whose smirched face was lighted up by the candle, and in whom Marius recognized, in spite of his daubing, Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, lifted above M. Leblanc‚Äôs head a sort of bludgeon made of two balls of lead, at the two ends of a bar of iron.
U||Marius could not resist this sight. ‚ÄúMy father,‚Äù he thought, ‚Äúforgive me!‚Äù
U||And his finger sought the trigger of his pistol.
U||The shot was on the point of being discharged when Th√©nardier‚Äôs voice shouted:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDon‚Äôt harm him!‚Äù
U||This desperate attempt of the victim, far from exasperating Th√©nardier, had calmed him. There existed in him two men, the ferocious man and the adroit man. Up to that moment, in the excess of his triumph in the presence of the prey which had been brought down, and which did not stir, the ferocious man had prevailed; when the victim struggled and tried to resist, the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand.
U||‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hurt him!‚Äù he repeated, and without suspecting it, his first success was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged, and to paralyze Marius, in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared, and who, in the face of this new phase, saw no inconvenience in waiting a while longer.
U||Who knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver him from the horrible alternative of allowing Ursule‚Äôs father to perish, or of destroying the colonel‚Äôs saviour?
U||A herculean struggle had begun. With one blow full in the chest, M. Leblanc had sent the old man tumbling, rolling in the middle of the room, then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two more assailants, and he held one under each of his knees; the wretches were rattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite millstone; but the other four had seized the formidable old man by both arms and the back of his neck, and were holding him doubled up over the two ‚Äúchimney-builders‚Äù on the floor.
U||Thus, the master of some and mastered by the rest, crushing those beneath him and stifling under those on top of him, endeavoring in vain to shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him, M. Leblanc disappeared under the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boar beneath a howling pile of dogs and hounds.
U||They succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window, and there they held him in awe. The Th√©nardier woman had not released her clutch on his hair.
U||‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you mix yourself up in this affair,‚Äù said Th√©nardier. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll tear your shawl.‚Äù
U||The Th√©nardier obeyed, as the female wolf obeys the male wolf, with a growl.
U||‚ÄúNow,‚Äù said Th√©nardier, ‚Äúsearch him, you other fellows!‚Äù
U||M. Leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance.
U||They searched him.
U||He had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six francs, and his handkerchief.
U||Th√©nardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket.
U||‚ÄúWhat! No pocket-book?‚Äù he demanded.
U||‚ÄúNo, nor watch,‚Äù replied one of the ‚Äúchimney-builders.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNever mind,‚Äù murmured the masked man who carried the big key, in the voice of a ventriloquist, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a tough old fellow.‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier went to the corner near the door, picked up a bundle of ropes and threw them at the men.
U||‚ÄúTie him to the leg of the bed,‚Äù said he.
U||And, catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across the room by the blow from M. Leblanc‚Äôs fist, and who made no movement, he added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIs Boulatruelle dead?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù replied Bigrenaille, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs drunk.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSweep him into a corner,‚Äù said Th√©nardier.
U||Two of the ‚Äúchimney-builders‚Äù pushed the drunken man into the corner near the heap of old iron with their feet.
U||‚ÄúBabet,‚Äù said Th√©nardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel, ‚Äúwhy did you bring so many; they were not needed.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat can you do?‚Äù replied the man with the cudgel, ‚Äúthey all wanted to be in it. This is a bad season. There‚Äôs no business going on.‚Äù
U||The pallet on which M. Leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospital bed, elevated on four coarse wooden legs, roughly hewn.
U||M. Leblanc let them take their own course.
U||The ruffians bound him securely, in an upright attitude, with his feet on the ground at the head of the bed, the end which was most remote from the window, and nearest to the fireplace.
U||When the last knot had been tied, Th√©nardier took a chair and seated himself almost facing M. Leblanc.
U||Th√©nardier no longer looked like himself; in the course of a few moments his face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil and cunning sweetness.
U||Marius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile of a man in official life the almost bestial mouth which had been foaming but a moment before; he gazed with amazement on that fantastic and alarming metamorphosis, and he felt as a man might feel who should behold a tiger converted into a lawyer.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur‚Äî‚Äù said Th√©nardier.
U||And dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands on M. Leblanc:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúStand off a little, and let me have a talk with the gentleman.‚Äù
U||All retired towards the door.
U||He went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur, you did wrong to try to jump out of the window. You might have broken your leg. Now, if you will permit me, we will converse quietly. In the first place, I must communicate to you an observation which I have made which is, that you have not uttered the faintest cry.‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier was right, this detail was correct, although it had escaped Marius in his agitation. M. Leblanc had barely pronounced a few words, without raising his voice, and even during his struggle with the six ruffians near the window he had preserved the most profound and singular silence.
U||Th√©nardier continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMon Dieu! You might have shouted ‚Äòstop thief‚Äô a bit, and I should not have thought it improper. ‚ÄòMurder!‚Äô That, too, is said occasionally, and, so far as I am concerned, I should not have taken it in bad part. It is very natural that you should make a little row when you find yourself with persons who don‚Äôt inspire you with sufficient confidence. You might have done that, and no one would have troubled you on that account. You would not even have been gagged. And I will tell you why. This room is very private. That‚Äôs its only recommendation, but it has that in its favor. You might fire off a mortar and it would produce about as much noise at the nearest police station as the snores of a drunken man. Here a cannon would make a boum, and the thunder would make a pouf. It‚Äôs a handy lodging. But, in short, you did not shout, and it is better so. I present you my compliments, and I will tell you the conclusion that I draw from that fact: My dear sir, when a man shouts, who comes? The police. And 
U||after the police? Justice. Well! You have not made an outcry; that is because you don‚Äôt care to have the police and the courts come in any more than we do. It is because,‚ÄîI have long suspected it,‚Äîyou have some interest in hiding something. On our side we have the same interest. So we can come to an understanding.‚Äù
U||As he spoke thus, it seemed as though Th√©nardier, who kept his eyes fixed on M. Leblanc, were trying to plunge the sharp points which darted from the pupils into the very conscience of his prisoner. Moreover, his language, which was stamped with a sort of moderated, subdued insolence and crafty insolence, was reserved and almost choice, and in that rascal, who had been nothing but a robber a short time previously, one now felt ‚Äúthe man who had studied for the priesthood.‚Äù
U||The silence preserved by the prisoner, that precaution which had been carried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life, that resistance opposed to the first impulse of nature, which is to utter a cry, all this, it must be confessed, now that his attention had been called to it, troubled Marius, and affected him with painful astonishment.
U||Th√©nardier‚Äôs well-grounded observation still further obscured for Marius the dense mystery which enveloped that grave and singular person on whom Courfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of Monsieur Leblanc.
U||But whoever he was, bound with ropes, surrounded with executioners, half plunged, so to speak, in a grave which was closing in upon him to the extent of a degree with every moment that passed, in the presence of Th√©nardier‚Äôs wrath, as in the presence of his sweetness, this man remained impassive; and Marius could not refrain from admiring at such a moment the superbly melancholy visage.
U||Here, evidently, was a soul which was inaccessible to terror, and which did not know the meaning of despair. Here was one of those men who command amazement in desperate circumstances. Extreme as was the crisis, inevitable as was the catastrophe, there was nothing here of the agony of the drowning man, who opens his horror-filled eyes under the water.
U||Th√©nardier rose in an unpretending manner, went to the fireplace, shoved aside the screen, which he leaned against the neighboring pallet, and thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals, in which the prisoner could plainly see the chisel white-hot and spotted here and there with tiny scarlet stars.
U||Then Th√©nardier returned to his seat beside M. Leblanc.
U||‚ÄúI continue,‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúWe can come to an understanding. Let us arrange this matter in an amicable way. I was wrong to lose my temper just now, I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking of, I went a great deal too far, I said extravagant things. For example, because you are a millionnaire, I told you that I exacted money, a lot of money, a deal of money. That would not be reasonable. Mon Dieu, in spite of your riches, you have expenses of your own‚Äîwho has not? I don‚Äôt want to ruin you, I am not a greedy fellow, after all. I am not one of those people who, because they have the advantage of the position, profit by the fact to make themselves ridiculous. Why, I‚Äôm taking things into consideration and making a sacrifice on my side. I only want two hundred thousand francs.‚Äù
U||M. Leblanc uttered not a word.
U||Th√©nardier went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou see that I put not a little water in my wine; I‚Äôm very moderate. I don‚Äôt know the state of your fortune, but I do know that you don‚Äôt stick at money, and a benevolent man like yourself can certainly give two hundred thousand francs to the father of a family who is out of luck. Certainly, you are reasonable, too; you haven‚Äôt imagined that I should take all the trouble I have to-day and organized this affair this evening, which has been labor well bestowed, in the opinion of these gentlemen, merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go and drink red wine at fifteen sous and eat veal at Desnoyer‚Äôs. Two hundred thousand francs‚Äîit‚Äôs surely worth all that. This trifle once out of your pocket, I guarantee you that that‚Äôs the end of the matter, and that you have no further demands to fear. You will say to me: ‚ÄòBut I haven‚Äôt two hundred thousand francs about me.‚Äô Oh! I‚Äôm not extortionate. I don‚Äôt demand that. I only ask one thing of you. Have the goodness to write what I am about 
U||to dictate to you.‚Äù
U||Here Th√©nardier paused; then he added, emphasizing his words, and casting a smile in the direction of the brazier:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI warn you that I shall not admit that you don‚Äôt know how to write.‚Äù
U||A grand inquisitor might have envied that smile.
U||Th√©nardier pushed the table close to M. Leblanc, and took an inkstand, a pen, and a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open, and in which gleamed the long blade of the knife.
U||He placed the sheet of paper before M. Leblanc.
U||‚ÄúWrite,‚Äù said he.
U||The prisoner spoke at last.
U||‚ÄúHow do you expect me to write? I am bound.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true, excuse me!‚Äù ejaculated Th√©nardier, ‚Äúyou are quite right.‚Äù
U||And turning to Bigrenaille:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúUntie the gentleman‚Äôs right arm.‚Äù
U||Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, executed Th√©nardier‚Äôs order.
U||When the prisoner‚Äôs right arm was free, Th√©nardier dipped the pen in the ink and presented it to him.
U||‚ÄúUnderstand thoroughly, sir, that you are in our power, at our discretion, that no human power can get you out of this, and that we shall be really grieved if we are forced to proceed to disagreeable extremities. I know neither your name, nor your address, but I warn you, that you will remain bound until the person charged with carrying the letter which you are about to write shall have returned. Now, be so good as to write.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù demanded the prisoner.
U||‚ÄúI will dictate.‚Äù
U||M. Leblanc took the pen.
U||Th√©nardier began to dictate:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMy daughter‚Äî‚Äù
U||The prisoner shuddered, and raised his eyes to Th√©nardier.
U||‚ÄúPut down ‚ÄòMy dear daughter‚Äô‚Äî‚Äù said Th√©nardier.
U||M. Leblanc obeyed.
U||Th√©nardier continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCome instantly‚Äî‚Äù
U||He paused:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou address her as thou, do you not?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWho?‚Äù asked M. Leblanc.
U||‚ÄúParbleu!‚Äù cried Th√©nardier, ‚Äúthe little one, the Lark.‚Äù
U||M. Leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI do not know what you mean.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGo on, nevertheless,‚Äù ejaculated Th√©nardier, and he continued to dictate:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCome immediately, I am in absolute need of thee. The person who will deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me. I am waiting for thee. Come with confidence.‚Äù
U||M. Leblanc had written the whole of this.
U||Th√©nardier resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAh! erase ‚Äòcome with confidence‚Äô; that might lead her to suppose that everything was not as it should be, and that distrust is possible.‚Äù
U||M. Leblanc erased the three words.
U||‚ÄúNow,‚Äù pursued Th√©nardier, ‚Äúsign it. What‚Äôs your name?‚Äù
U||The prisoner laid down the pen and demanded:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFor whom is this letter?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou know well,‚Äù retorted Th√©nardier, ‚Äúfor the little one I just told you so.‚Äù
U||It was evident that Th√©nardier avoided naming the young girl in question. He said ‚Äúthe Lark,‚Äù he said ‚Äúthe little one,‚Äù but he did not pronounce her name‚Äîthe precaution of a clever man guarding his secret from his accomplices. To mention the name was to deliver the whole ‚Äúaffair‚Äù into their hands, and to tell them more about it than there was any need of their knowing.
U||He went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSign. What is your name?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúUrbain Fabre,‚Äù said the prisoner.
U||Th√©nardier, with the movement of a cat, dashed his hand into his pocket and drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on M. Leblanc. He looked for the mark on it, and held it close to the candle.
U||‚ÄúU. F. That‚Äôs it. Urbain Fabre. Well, sign it U. F.‚Äù
U||The prisoner signed.
U||‚ÄúAs two hands are required to fold the letter, give it to me, I will fold it.‚Äù
U||That done, Th√©nardier resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAddress it, ‚ÄòMademoiselle Fabre,‚Äô at your house. I know that you live a long distance from here, near Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, because you go to mass there every day, but I don‚Äôt know in what street. I see that you understand your situation. As you have not lied about your name, you will not lie about your address. Write it yourself.‚Äù
U||The prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment, then he took the pen and wrote:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMademoiselle Fabre, at M. Urbain Fabre‚Äôs, Rue Saint-Dominique-D‚ÄôEnfer, No. 17.‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion.
U||‚ÄúWife!‚Äù he cried.
U||The Th√©nardier woman hastened to him.
U||‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the letter. You know what you have to do. There is a carriage at the door. Set out at once, and return ditto.‚Äù
U||And addressing the man with the meat-axe:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSince you have taken off your nose-screen, accompany the mistress. You will get up behind the fiacre. You know where you left the team?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the man.
U||And depositing his axe in a corner, he followed Madame Th√©nardier.
U||As they set off, Th√©nardier thrust his head through the half-open door, and shouted into the corridor:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAbove all things, don‚Äôt lose the letter! remember that you carry two hundred thousand francs with you!‚Äù
U||The Th√©nardier‚Äôs hoarse voice replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBe easy. I have it in my bosom.‚Äù
U||A minute had not elapsed, when the sound of the cracking of a whip was heard, which rapidly retreated and died away.
U||‚ÄúGood!‚Äù growled Th√©nardier. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going at a fine pace. At such a gallop, the bourgeoise will be back inside three-quarters of an hour.‚Äù
U||He drew a chair close to the fireplace, folding his arms, and presenting his muddy boots to the brazier.
U||‚ÄúMy feet are cold!‚Äù said he.
U||Only five ruffians now remained in the den with Th√©nardier and the prisoner.
U||These men, through the black masks or paste which covered their faces, and made of them, at fear‚Äôs pleasure, charcoal-burners, negroes, or demons, had a stupid and gloomy air, and it could be felt that they perpetrated a crime like a bit of work, tranquilly, without either wrath or mercy, with a sort of ennui. They were crowded together in one corner like brutes, and remained silent.
U||Th√©nardier warmed his feet.
U||The prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity. A sombre calm had succeeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few moments before.
U||The candle, on which a large ‚Äústranger‚Äù had formed, cast but a dim light in the immense hovel, the brazier had grown dull, and all those monstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling.
U||No sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man, who was fast asleep.
U||Marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle. The enigma was more impenetrable than ever.
U||Who was this ‚Äúlittle one‚Äù whom Th√©nardier had called the Lark? Was she his ‚ÄúUrsule‚Äù? The prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word, ‚Äúthe Lark,‚Äù and had replied in the most natural manner in the world: ‚ÄúI do not know what you mean.‚Äù On the other hand, the two letters U. F. were explained; they meant Urbain Fabre; and Ursule was no longer named Ursule. This was what Marius perceived most clearly of all.
U||A sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post, from which he was observing and commanding this whole scene. There he stood, almost incapable of movement or reflection, as though annihilated by the abominable things viewed at such close quarters. He waited, in the hope of some incident, no matter of what nature, since he could not collect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide.
U||‚ÄúIn any case,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúif she is the Lark, I shall see her, for the Th√©nardier woman is to bring her hither. That will be the end, and then I will give my life and my blood if necessary, but I will deliver her! Nothing shall stop me.‚Äù
U||Nearly half an hour passed in this manner. Th√©nardier seemed to be absorbed in gloomy reflections, the prisoner did not stir. Still, Marius fancied that at intervals, and for the last few moments, he had heard a faint, dull noise in the direction of the prisoner.
U||All at once, Th√©nardier addressed the prisoner:
U||‚ÄúBy the way, Monsieur Fabre, I might as well say it to you at once.‚Äù
U||These few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation. Marius strained his ears.
U||‚ÄúMy wife will be back shortly, don‚Äôt get impatient. I think that the Lark really is your daughter, and it seems to me quite natural that you should keep her. Only, listen to me a bit. My wife will go and hunt her up with your letter. I told my wife to dress herself in the way she did, so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her. They will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind. Somewhere, outside the barrier, there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses. Your young lady will be taken to it. She will alight from the fiacre. My comrade will enter the other vehicle with her, and my wife will come back here to tell us: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs done.‚Äô As for the young lady, no harm will be done to her; the trap will conduct her to a place where she will be quiet, and just as soon as you have handed over to me those little two hundred thousand francs, she will be returned to you. If you have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù
U||The prisoner uttered not a syllable. After a pause, Th√©nardier continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very simple, as you see. There‚Äôll be no harm done unless you wish that there should be harm done. I‚Äôm telling you how things stand. I warn you so that you may be prepared.‚Äù
U||He paused: the prisoner did not break the silence, and Th√©nardier resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAs soon as my wife returns and says to me: ‚ÄòThe Lark is on the way,‚Äô we will release you, and you will be free to go and sleep at home. You see that our intentions are not evil.‚Äù
U||Terrible images passed through Marius‚Äô mind. What! That young girl whom they were abducting was not to be brought back? One of those monsters was to bear her off into the darkness? Whither? And what if it were she!
U||It was clear that it was she. Marius felt his heart stop beating.
U||What was he to do? Discharge the pistol? Place all those scoundrels in the hands of justice? But the horrible man with the meat-axe would, nonetheless, be out of reach with the young girl, and Marius reflected on Th√©nardier‚Äôs words, of which he perceived the bloody significance: ‚ÄúIf you have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark.‚Äù
U||Now, it was not alone by the colonel‚Äôs testament, it was by his own love, it was by the peril of the one he loved, that he felt himself restrained.
U||This frightful situation, which had already lasted above half an hour, was changing its aspect every moment.
U||Marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the most heart-breaking conjectures, seeking hope and finding none.
U||The tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of the den.
U||In the midst of this silence, the door at the bottom of the staircase was heard to open and shut again.
U||The prisoner made a movement in his bonds.
U||‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the bourgeoise,‚Äù said Th√©nardier.
U||He had hardly uttered the words, when the Th√©nardier woman did in fact rush hastily into the room, red, panting, breathless, with flaming eyes, and cried, as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFalse address!‚Äù
U||The ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and picked up his axe again.
U||She resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúNobody there! Rue Saint-Dominique, No. 17, no Monsieur Urbain Fabre! They know not what it means!‚Äù
U||She paused, choking, then went on:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Th√©nardier! That old fellow has duped you! You are too good, you see! If it had been me, I‚Äôd have chopped the beast in four quarters to begin with! And if he had acted ugly, I‚Äôd have boiled him alive! He would have been obliged to speak, and say where the girl is, and where he keeps his shiners! That‚Äôs the way I should have managed matters! People are perfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupider than women! Nobody at No. 17. It‚Äôs nothing but a big carriage gate! No Monsieur Fabre in the Rue Saint-Dominique! And after all that racing and fee to the coachman and all! I spoke to both the porter and the portress, a fine, stout woman, and they know nothing about him!‚Äù
U||Marius breathed freely once more.
U||She, Ursule or the Lark, he no longer knew what to call her, was safe.
U||While his exasperated wife vociferated, Th√©nardier had seated himself on the table.
U||For several minutes he uttered not a word, but swung his right foot, which hung down, and stared at the brazier with an air of savage reverie.
U||Finally, he said to the prisoner, with a slow and singularly ferocious tone:
U||‚ÄúA false address? What did you expect to gain by that?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo gain time!‚Äù cried the prisoner in a thundering voice, and at the same instant he shook off his bonds; they were cut. The prisoner was only attached to the bed now by one leg.
U||Before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward, he had bent down into the fireplace, had stretched out his hand to the brazier, and had then straightened himself up again, and now Th√©nardier, the female Th√©nardier, and the ruffians, huddled in amazement at the extremity of the hovel, stared at him in stupefaction, as almost free and in a formidable attitude, he brandished above his head the red-hot chisel, which emitted a threatening glow.
U||The judicial examination to which the ambush in the Gorbeau house eventually gave rise, established the fact that a large sou piece, cut and worked in a peculiar fashion, was found in the garret, when the police made their descent on it. This sou piece was one of those marvels of industry, which are engendered by the patience of the galleys in the shadows and for the shadows, marvels which are nothing else than instruments of escape. These hideous and delicate products of wonderful art are to jewellers‚Äô work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry. There are Benvenuto Cellinis in the galleys, just as there are Villons in language. The unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance finds means sometimes without tools, sometimes with a common wooden-handled knife, to saw a sou into two thin plates, to hollow out these plates without affecting the coinage stamp, and to make a furrow on the edge of the sou in such a manner that the plates will adhere again. This can be screwed together and unscrewed at will; it i
U||s a box. In this box he hides a watch-spring, and this watch-spring, properly handled, cuts good-sized chains and bars of iron. The unfortunate convict is supposed to possess merely a sou; not at all, he possesses liberty. It was a large sou of this sort which, during the subsequent search of the police, was found under the bed near the window. They also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou.
U||It is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person at the moment when the ruffians searched him, that he contrived to conceal it in his hand, and that afterward, having his right hand free, he unscrewed it, and used it as a saw to cut the cords which fastened him, which would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements which Marius had observed.
U||As he had not been able to bend down, for fear of betraying himself, he had not cut the bonds of his left leg.
U||The ruffians had recovered from their first surprise.
U||‚ÄúBe easy,‚Äù said Bigrenaille to Th√©nardier. ‚ÄúHe still holds by one leg, and he can‚Äôt get away. I‚Äôll answer for that. I tied that paw for him.‚Äù
U||In the meanwhile, the prisoner had begun to speak:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou are wretches, but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it. When you think that you can make me speak, that you can make me write what I do not choose to write, that you can make me say what I do not choose to say‚Äî‚Äù
U||He stripped up his left sleeve, and added:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSee here.‚Äù
U||At the same moment he extended his arm, and laid the glowing chisel which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh.
U||The crackling of the burning flesh became audible, and the odor peculiar to chambers of torture filled the hovel.
U||Red Hot Chisel
U||Marius reeled in utter horror, the very ruffians shuddered, hardly a muscle of the old man‚Äôs face contracted, and while the red-hot iron sank into the smoking wound, impassive and almost august, he fixed on Th√©nardier his beautiful glance, in which there was no hatred, and where suffering vanished in serene majesty.
U||With grand and lofty natures, the revolts of the flesh and the senses when subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth, and make it appear on the brow, just as rebellions among the soldiery force the captain to show himself.
U||‚ÄúWretches!‚Äù said he, ‚Äúhave no more fear of me than I have for you!‚Äù
U||And, tearing the chisel from the wound, he hurled it through the window, which had been left open; the horrible, glowing tool disappeared into the night, whirling as it flew, and fell far away on the snow.
U||The prisoner resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDo what you please with me.‚Äù He was disarmed.
U||‚ÄúSeize him!‚Äù said Th√©nardier.
U||Two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder, and the masked man with the ventriloquist‚Äôs voice took up his station in front of him, ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement.
U||At the same time, Marius heard below him, at the base of the partition, but so near that he could not see who was speaking, this colloquy conducted in a low tone:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThere is only one thing left to do.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCut his throat.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it.‚Äù
U||It was the husband and wife taking counsel together.
U||Th√©nardier walked slowly towards the table, opened the drawer, and took out the knife. Marius fretted with the handle of his pistol. Unprecedented perplexity! For the last hour he had had two voices in his conscience, the one enjoining him to respect his father‚Äôs testament, the other crying to him to rescue the prisoner. These two voices continued uninterruptedly that struggle which tormented him to agony. Up to that moment he had cherished a vague hope that he should find some means of reconciling these two duties, but nothing within the limits of possibility had presented itself.
U||However, the peril was urgent, the last bounds of delay had been reached; Th√©nardier was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant from the prisoner.
U||Marius cast a wild glance about him, the last mechanical resource of despair. All at once a shudder ran through him.
U||At his feet, on the table, a bright ray of light from the full moon illuminated and seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper. On this paper he read the following line written that very morning, in large letters, by the eldest of the Th√©nardier girls:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúTHE BOBBIES ARE HERE.‚Äù
U||An idea, a flash, crossed Marius‚Äô mind; this was the expedient of which he was in search, the solution of that frightful problem which was torturing him, of sparing the assassin and saving the victim.
U||He knelt down on his commode, stretched out his arm, seized the sheet of paper, softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall, wrapped the paper round it, and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of the den.
U||It was high time. Th√©nardier had conquered his last fears or his last scruples, and was advancing on the prisoner.
U||‚ÄúSomething is falling!‚Äù cried the Th√©nardier woman.
U||‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù asked her husband.
U||The woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster. She handed it to her husband.
U||‚ÄúWhere did this come from?‚Äù demanded Th√©nardier.
U||‚ÄúPardie!‚Äù ejaculated his wife, ‚Äúwhere do you suppose it came from? Through the window, of course.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI saw it pass,‚Äù said Bigrenaille.
U||Th√©nardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle.
U||‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in √âponine‚Äôs handwriting. The devil!‚Äù
U||He made a sign to his wife, who hastily drew near, and showed her the line written on the sheet of paper, then he added in a subdued voice:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúQuick! The ladder! Let‚Äôs leave the bacon in the mousetrap and decamp!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWithout cutting that man‚Äôs throat?‚Äù asked, the Th√©nardier woman.
U||‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt the time.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThrough what?‚Äù resumed Bigrenaille.
U||‚ÄúThrough the window,‚Äù replied Th√©nardier. ‚ÄúSince Ponine has thrown the stone through the window, it indicates that the house is not watched on that side.‚Äù
U||The mask with the ventriloquist‚Äôs voice deposited his huge key on the floor, raised both arms in the air, and opened and clenched his fists, three times rapidly without uttering a word.
U||This was the signal like the signal for clearing the decks for action on board ship.
U||The ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him; in the twinkling of an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window, and solidly fastened to the sill by the two iron hooks.
U||The prisoner paid no attention to what was going on around him. He seemed to be dreaming or praying.
U||As soon as the ladder was arranged, Th√©nardier cried:
U||‚ÄúCome! the bourgeoise first!‚Äù
U||And he rushed headlong to the window.
U||But just as he was about to throw his leg over, Bigrenaille seized him roughly by the collar.
U||‚ÄúNot much, come now, you old dog, after us!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAfter us!‚Äù yelled the ruffians.
U||‚ÄúYou are children,‚Äù said Th√©nardier, ‚Äúwe are losing time. The police are on our heels.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said the ruffians, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs draw lots to see who shall go down first.‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAre you mad! Are you crazy! What a pack of boobies! You want to waste time, do you? Draw lots, do you? By a wet finger, by a short straw! With written names! Thrown into a hat!‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWould you like my hat?‚Äù cried a voice on the threshold.
U||All wheeled round. It was Javert.
U||He had his hat in his hand, and was holding it out to them with a smile.
U||CHAPTER XXI‚ÄîONE SHOULD ALWAYS BEGIN BY ARRESTING THE VICTIMS
U||At nightfall, Javert had posted his men and had gone into ambush himself between the trees of the Rue de la Barri√®re-des-Gobelins which faced the Gorbeau house, on the other side of the boulevard. He had begun operations by opening ‚Äúhis pockets,‚Äù and dropping into it the two young girls who were charged with keeping a watch on the approaches to the den. But he had only ‚Äúcaged‚Äù Azelma. As for √âponine, she was not at her post, she had disappeared, and he had not been able to seize her. Then Javert had made a point and had bent his ear to waiting for the signal agreed upon. The comings and goings of the fiacres had greatly agitated him. At last, he had grown impatient, and, sure that there was a nest there, sure of being in ‚Äúluck,‚Äù having recognized many of the ruffians who had entered, he had finally decided to go upstairs without waiting for the pistol-shot.
U||It will be remembered that he had Marius‚Äô pass-key.
U||He had arrived just in the nick of time.
U||The terrified ruffians flung themselves on the arms which they had abandoned in all the corners at the moment of flight. In less than a second, these seven men, horrible to behold, had grouped themselves in an attitude of defence, one with his meat-axe, another with his key, another with his bludgeon, the rest with shears, pincers, and hammers. Th√©nardier had his knife in his fist. The Th√©nardier woman snatched up an enormous paving-stone which lay in the angle of the window and served her daughters as an ottoman.
U||Snatched up a Paving Stone
U||Javert put on his hat again, and advanced a couple of paces into the room, with arms folded, his cane under one arm, his sword in its sheath.
U||‚ÄúHalt there,‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúYou shall not go out by the window, you shall go through the door. It‚Äôs less unhealthy. There are seven of you, there are fifteen of us. Don‚Äôt let‚Äôs fall to collaring each other like men of Auvergne.‚Äù
U||Bigrenaille drew out a pistol which he had kept concealed under his blouse, and put it in Th√©nardier‚Äôs hand, whispering in the latter‚Äôs ear:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Javert. I don‚Äôt dare fire at that man. Do you dare?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúParbleu!‚Äù replied Th√©nardier.
U||‚ÄúWell, then, fire.‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier took the pistol and aimed at Javert.
U||Javert, who was only three paces from him, stared intently at him and contented himself with saying:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCome now, don‚Äôt fire. You‚Äôll miss fire.‚Äù
U||Th√©nardier pulled the trigger. The pistol missed fire.
U||‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt I tell you so!‚Äù ejaculated Javert.
U||Bigrenaille flung his bludgeon at Javert‚Äôs feet.
U||‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the emperor of the fiends! I surrender.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù Javert asked the rest of the ruffians.
U||They replied:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSo do we.‚Äù
U||Javert began again calmly:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, that‚Äôs good, I said so, you are nice fellows.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI only ask one thing,‚Äù said Bigrenaille, ‚Äúand that is, that I may not be denied tobacco while I am in confinement.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGranted,‚Äù said Javert.
U||And turning round and calling behind him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCome in now!‚Äù
U||A squad of policemen, sword in hand, and agents armed with bludgeons and cudgels, rushed in at Javert‚Äôs summons. They pinioned the ruffians.
U||This throng of men, sparely lighted by the single candle, filled the den with shadows.
U||‚ÄúHandcuff them all!‚Äù shouted Javert.
U||‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù cried a voice which was not the voice of a man, but of which no one would ever have said: ‚ÄúIt is a woman‚Äôs voice.‚Äù
U||The Th√©nardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of the window, and it was she who had just given vent to this roar.
U||The policemen and agents recoiled.
U||She had thrown off her shawl, but retained her bonnet; her husband, who was crouching behind her, was almost hidden under the discarded shawl, and she was shielding him with her body, as she elevated the paving-stone above her head with the gesture of a giantess on the point of hurling a rock.
U||‚ÄúBeware!‚Äù she shouted.
U||All crowded back towards the corridor. A broad open space was cleared in the middle of the garret.
U||The Th√©nardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowed themselves to be pinioned, and muttered in hoarse and guttural accents:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe cowards!‚Äù
U||Javert smiled, and advanced across the open space which the Th√©nardier was devouring with her eyes.
U||‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come near me,‚Äù she cried, ‚Äúor I‚Äôll crush you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat a grenadier!‚Äù ejaculated Javert; ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got a beard like a man, mother, but I have claws like a woman.‚Äù
U||And he continued to advance.
U||The Th√©nardier, dishevelled and terrible, set her feet far apart, threw herself backwards, and hurled the paving-stone at Javert‚Äôs head. Javert ducked, the stone passed over him, struck the wall behind, knocked off a huge piece of plastering, and, rebounding from angle to angle across the hovel, now luckily almost empty, rested at Javert‚Äôs feet.
U||At the same moment, Javert reached the Th√©nardier couple. One of his big hands descended on the woman‚Äôs shoulder; the other on the husband‚Äôs head.
U||‚ÄúThe handcuffs!‚Äù he shouted.
U||The policemen trooped in in force, and in a few seconds Javert‚Äôs order had been executed.
U||The Th√©nardier female, overwhelmed, stared at her pinioned hands, and at those of her husband, who had dropped to the floor, and exclaimed, weeping:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMy daughters!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThey are in the jug,‚Äù said Javert.
U||In the meanwhile, the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleep behind the door, and were shaking him:‚Äî
U||He awoke, stammering:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIs it all over, Jondrette?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied Javert.
U||The six pinioned ruffians were standing, and still preserved their spectral mien; all three besmeared with black, all three masked.
U||‚ÄúKeep on your masks,‚Äù said Javert.
U||And passing them in review with a glance of a Frederick II. at a Potsdam parade, he said to the three ‚Äúchimney-builders‚Äù:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGood day, Bigrenaille! good day, Brujon! good day, Deuxmilliards!‚Äù
U||Then turning to the three masked men, he said to the man with the meat-axe:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGood day, Gueulemer!‚Äù
U||And to the man with the cudgel:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGood day, Babet!‚Äù
U||And to the ventriloquist:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYour health, Claquesous.‚Äù
U||At that moment, he caught sight of the ruffians‚Äô prisoner, who, ever since the entrance of the police, had not uttered a word, and had held his head down.
U||‚ÄúUntie the gentleman!‚Äù said Javert, ‚Äúand let no one go out!‚Äù
U||That said, he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table, where the candle and the writing-materials still remained, drew a stamped paper from his pocket, and began to prepare his report.
U||When he had written the first lines, which are formulas that never vary, he raised his eyes:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLet the gentleman whom these gentlemen bound step forward.‚Äù
U||The policemen glanced round them.
U||‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Javert, ‚Äúwhere is he?‚Äù
U||The prisoner of the ruffians, M. Leblanc, M. Urbain Fabre, the father of Ursule or the Lark, had disappeared.
U||The door was guarded, but the window was not. As soon as he had found himself released from his bonds, and while Javert was drawing up his report, he had taken advantage of confusion, the crowd, the darkness, and of a moment when the general attention was diverted from him, to dash out of the window.
U||An agent sprang to the opening and looked out. He saw no one outside.
U||The rope ladder was still shaking.
U||‚ÄúThe devil!‚Äù ejaculated Javert between his teeth, ‚Äúhe must have been the most valuable of the lot.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER XXII‚ÄîTHE LITTLE ONE WHO WAS CRYING IN VOLUME TWO
U||On the day following that on which these events took place in the house on the Boulevard de l‚ÄôH√¥pital, a child, who seemed to be coming from the direction of the bridge of Austerlitz, was ascending the side-alley on the right in the direction of the Barri√®re de Fontainebleau.
U||Night had fully come.
U||This lad was pale, thin, clad in rags, with linen trousers in the month of February, and was singing at the top of his voice.
U||At the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, a bent old woman was rummaging in a heap of refuse by the light of a street lantern; the child jostled her as he passed, then recoiled, exclaiming:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHello! And I took it for an enormous, enormous dog!‚Äù
U||He pronounced the word enormous the second time with a jeering swell of the voice which might be tolerably well represented by capitals: ‚Äúan enormous, ENORMOUS dog.‚Äù
U||The old woman straightened herself up in a fury.
U||‚ÄúNasty brat!‚Äù she grumbled. ‚ÄúIf I hadn‚Äôt been bending over, I know well where I would have planted my foot on you.‚Äù
U||The boy was already far away.
U||‚ÄúKisss! kisss!‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúAfter that, I don‚Äôt think I was mistaken!‚Äù
U||The old woman, choking with indignation, now rose completely upright, and the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face, all hollowed into angles and wrinkles, with crow‚Äôs-feet meeting the corners of her mouth.
U||Her body was lost in the darkness, and only her head was visible. One would have pronounced her a mask of Decrepitude carved out by a light from the night.
U||The boy surveyed her.
U||‚ÄúMadame,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúdoes not possess that style of beauty which pleases me.‚Äù
U||He then pursued his road, and resumed his song:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLe roi Coupdesabot
U||S‚Äôen allait √† la chasse,
U||√Ä la chasse aux corbeaux‚Äî‚Äù
U||At the end of these three lines he paused. He had arrived in front of No. 50-52, and finding the door fastened, he began to assault it with resounding and heroic kicks, which betrayed rather the man‚Äôs shoes that he was wearing than the child‚Äôs feet which he owned.
U||In the meanwhile, the very old woman whom he had encountered at the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier hastened up behind him, uttering clamorous cries and indulging in lavish and exaggerated gestures.
U||‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this? What‚Äôs this? Lord God! He‚Äôs battering the door down! He‚Äôs knocking the house down.‚Äù
U||The kicks continued.
U||The old woman strained her lungs.
U||‚ÄúIs that the way buildings are treated nowadays?‚Äù
U||All at once she paused.
U||She had recognized the gamin.
U||‚ÄúWhat! so it‚Äôs that imp!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy, it‚Äôs the old lady,‚Äù said the lad. ‚ÄúGood day, Bougonmuche. I have come to see my ancestors.‚Äù
U||The old woman retorted with a composite grimace, and a wonderful improvisation of hatred taking advantage of feebleness and ugliness, which was, unfortunately, wasted in the dark:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no one here.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBah!‚Äù retorted the boy, ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs my father?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAt La Force.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCome, now! And my mother?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAt Saint-Lazare.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell! And my sisters?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAt the Madelonettes.‚Äù
U||The lad scratched his head behind his ear, stared at Ma‚Äôam Bougon, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù
U||Then he executed a pirouette on his heel; a moment later, the old woman, who had remained on the door-step, heard him singing in his clear, young voice, as he plunged under the black elm-trees, in the wintry wind:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúLe roi Coupdesabot
U||S‚Äôen allait √† la chasse,
U||√Ä la chasse aux corbeaux,
U||Mont√© sur deux √©chasses.
U||Quand on passait dessous,
U||On lui payait deux sous.‚Äù31

U||THE IDYL IN THE RUE PLUMET AND THE EPIC IN THE RUE SAINT-DENIS
U||BOOK FIRST‚ÄîA FEW PAGES OF HISTORY
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîWELL CUT
U||1831 and 1832, the two years which are immediately connected with the Revolution of July, form one of the most peculiar and striking moments of history. These two years rise like two mountains midway between those which precede and those which follow them. They have a revolutionary grandeur. Precipices are to be distinguished there. The social masses, the very assizes of civilization, the solid group of superposed and adhering interests, the century-old profiles of the ancient French formation, appear and disappear in them every instant, athwart the storm clouds of systems, of passions, and of theories. These appearances and disappearances have been designated as movement and resistance. At intervals, truth, that daylight of the human soul, can be descried shining there.
U||This remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning to be sufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the principal lines even at the present day.
U||We shall make the attempt.
U||The Restoration had been one of those intermediate phases, hard to define, in which there is fatigue, buzzing, murmurs, sleep, tumult, and which are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a halting-place.
U||These epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire to convert them to profit. In the beginning, the nation asks nothing but repose; it thirsts for but one thing, peace; it has but one ambition, to be small. Which is the translation of remaining tranquil. Of great events, great hazards, great adventures, great men, thank God, we have seen enough, we have them heaped higher than our heads. We would exchange C√¶sar for Prusias, and Napoleon for the King of Yvetot. ‚ÄúWhat a good little king was he!‚Äù We have marched since daybreak, we have reached the evening of a long and toilsome day; we have made our first change with Mirabeau, the second with Robespierre, the third with Bonaparte; we are worn out. Each one demands a bed.
U||Devotion which is weary, heroism which has grown old, ambitions which are sated, fortunes which are made, seek, demand, implore, solicit, what? A shelter. They have it. They take possession of peace, of tranquillity, of leisure; behold, they are content. But, at the same time certain facts arise, compel recognition, and knock at the door in their turn. These facts are the products of revolutions and wars, they are, they exist, they have the right to install themselves in society, and they do install themselves therein; and most of the time, facts are the stewards of the household and fouriers32 who do nothing but prepare lodgings for principles.
U||This, then, is what appears to philosophical politicians:‚Äî
U||At the same time that weary men demand repose, accomplished facts demand guarantees. Guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men.
U||This is what England demanded of the Stuarts after the Protector; this is what France demanded of the Bourbons after the Empire.
U||These guarantees are a necessity of the times. They must be accorded. Princes ‚Äúgrant‚Äù them, but in reality, it is the force of things which gives them. A profound truth, and one useful to know, which the Stuarts did not suspect in 1662 and which the Bourbons did not even obtain a glimpse of in 1814.
U||The predestined family, which returned to France when Napoleon fell, had the fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed, and that what it had bestowed it could take back again; that the House of Bourbon possessed the right divine, that France possessed nothing, and that the political right conceded in the charter of Louis XVIII. was merely a branch of the right divine, was detached by the House of Bourbon and graciously given to the people until such day as it should please the King to reassume it. Still, the House of Bourbon should have felt, from the displeasure created by the gift, that it did not come from it.
U||This house was churlish to the nineteenth century. It put on an ill-tempered look at every development of the nation. To make use of a trivial word, that is to say, of a popular and a true word, it looked glum. The people saw this.
U||It thought it possessed strength because the Empire had been carried away before it like a theatrical stage-setting. It did not perceive that it had, itself, been brought in in the same fashion. It did not perceive that it also lay in that hand which had removed Napoleon.
U||It thought that it had roots, because it was the past. It was mistaken; it formed a part of the past, but the whole past was France. The roots of French society were not fixed in the Bourbons, but in the nations. These obscure and lively roots constituted, not the right of a family, but the history of a people. They were everywhere, except under the throne.
U||The House of Bourbon was to France the illustrious and bleeding knot in her history, but was no longer the principal element of her destiny, and the necessary base of her politics. She could get along without the Bourbons; she had done without them for two and twenty years; there had been a break of continuity; they did not suspect the fact. And how should they have suspected it, they who fancied that Louis XVII. reigned on the 9th of Thermidor, and that Louis XVIII. was reigning at the battle of Marengo? Never, since the origin of history, had princes been so blind in the presence of facts and the portion of divine authority which facts contain and promulgate. Never had that pretension here below which is called the right of kings denied to such a point the right from on high.
U||A capital error which led this family to lay its hand once more on the guarantees ‚Äúgranted‚Äù in 1814, on the concessions, as it termed them. Sad. A sad thing! What it termed its concessions were our conquests; what it termed our encroachments were our rights.
U||When the hour seemed to it to have come, the Restoration, supposing itself victorious over Bonaparte and well-rooted in the country, that is to say, believing itself to be strong and deep, abruptly decided on its plan of action, and risked its stroke. One morning it drew itself up before the face of France, and, elevating its voice, it contested the collective title and the individual right of the nation to sovereignty, of the citizen to liberty. In other words, it denied to the nation that which made it a nation, and to the citizen that which made him a citizen.
U||This is the foundation of those famous acts which are called the ordinances of July. The Restoration fell.
U||It fell justly. But, we admit, it had not been absolutely hostile to all forms of progress. Great things had been accomplished, with it alongside.
U||Under the Restoration, the nation had grown accustomed to calm discussion, which had been lacking under the Republic, and to grandeur in peace, which had been wanting under the Empire. France free and strong had offered an encouraging spectacle to the other peoples of Europe. The Revolution had had the word under Robespierre; the cannon had had the word under Bonaparte; it was under Louis XVIII. and Charles X. that it was the turn of intelligence to have the word. The wind ceased, the torch was lighted once more. On the lofty heights, the pure light of mind could be seen flickering. A magnificent, useful, and charming spectacle. For a space of fifteen years, those great principles which are so old for the thinker, so new for the statesman, could be seen at work in perfect peace, on the public square; equality before the law, liberty of conscience, liberty of speech, liberty of the press, the accessibility of all aptitudes to all functions. Thus it proceeded until 1830. The Bourbons were an instrument of civi
U||lization which broke in the hands of Providence.
U||The fall of the Bourbons was full of grandeur, not on their side, but on the side of the nation. They quitted the throne with gravity, but without authority; their descent into the night was not one of those solemn disappearances which leave a sombre emotion in history; it was neither the spectral calm of Charles I., nor the eagle scream of Napoleon. They departed, that is all. They laid down the crown, and retained no aureole. They were worthy, but they were not august. They lacked, in a certain measure, the majesty of their misfortune. Charles X. during the voyage from Cherbourg, causing a round table to be cut over into a square table, appeared to be more anxious about imperilled etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy. This diminution saddened devoted men who loved their persons, and serious men who honored their race. The populace was admirable. The nation, attacked one morning with weapons, by a sort of royal insurrection, felt itself in the possession of so much force that it did not go into a rag
U||e. It defended itself, restrained itself, restored things to their places, the government to law, the Bourbons to exile, alas! and then halted! It took the old king Charles X. from beneath that dais which had sheltered Louis XIV. and set him gently on the ground. It touched the royal personages only with sadness and precaution. It was not one man, it was not a few men, it was France, France entire, France victorious and intoxicated with her victory, who seemed to be coming to herself, and who put into practice, before the eyes of the whole world, these grave words of Guillaume du Vair after the day of the Barricades:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favors of the great, and to spring, like a bird from bough to bough, from an afflicted fortune to a flourishing one, to show themselves harsh towards their Prince in his adversity; but as for me, the fortune of my Kings and especially of my afflicted Kings, will always be venerable to me.‚Äù
U||The Bourbons carried away with them respect, but not regret. As we have just stated, their misfortune was greater than they were. They faded out in the horizon.
U||The Revolution of July instantly had friends and enemies throughout the entire world. The first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm, the others turned away, each according to his nature. At the first blush, the princes of Europe, the owls of this dawn, shut their eyes, wounded and stupefied, and only opened them to threaten. A fright which can be comprehended, a wrath which can be pardoned. This strange revolution had hardly produced a shock; it had not even paid to vanquished royalty the honor of treating it as an enemy, and of shedding its blood. In the eyes of despotic governments, who are always interested in having liberty calumniate itself, the Revolution of July committed the fault of being formidable and of remaining gentle. Nothing, however, was attempted or plotted against it. The most discontented, the most irritated, the most trembling, saluted it; whatever our egotism and our rancor may be, a mysterious respect springs from events in which we are sensible of the collaboration of some one w
U||ho is working above man.
U||The Revolution of July is the triumph of right overthrowing the fact. A thing which is full of splendor.
U||Right overthrowing the fact. Hence the brilliancy of the Revolution of 1830, hence, also, its mildness. Right triumphant has no need of being violent.
U||Right is the just and the true.
U||The property of right is to remain eternally beautiful and pure. The fact, even when most necessary to all appearances, even when most thoroughly accepted by contemporaries, if it exist only as a fact, and if it contain only too little of right, or none at all, is infallibly destined to become, in the course of time, deformed, impure, perhaps, even monstrous. If one desires to learn at one blow, to what degree of hideousness the fact can attain, viewed at the distance of centuries, let him look at Machiavelli. Machiavelli is not an evil genius, nor a demon, nor a miserable and cowardly writer; he is nothing but the fact. And he is not only the Italian fact; he is the European fact, the fact of the sixteenth century. He seems hideous, and so he is, in the presence of the moral idea of the nineteenth.
U||This conflict of right and fact has been going on ever since the origin of society. To terminate this duel, to amalgamate the pure idea with the humane reality, to cause right to penetrate pacifically into the fact and the fact into right, that is the task of sages.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîBADLY SEWED
U||But the task of sages is one thing, the task of clever men is another. The Revolution of 1830 came to a sudden halt.
U||As soon as a revolution has made the coast, the skilful make haste to prepare the shipwreck.
U||The skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title of Statesmen; so that this word, statesmen, has ended by becoming somewhat of a slang word. It must be borne in mind, in fact, that wherever there is nothing but skill, there is necessarily pettiness. To say ‚Äúthe skilful‚Äù amounts to saying ‚Äúthe mediocre.‚Äù
U||In the same way, to say ‚Äústatesmen‚Äù is sometimes equivalent to saying ‚Äútraitors.‚Äù If, then, we are to believe the skilful, revolutions like the Revolution of July are severed arteries; a prompt ligature is indispensable. The right, too grandly proclaimed, is shaken. Also, right once firmly fixed, the state must be strengthened. Liberty once assured, attention must be directed to power.
U||Here the sages are not, as yet, separated from the skilful, but they begin to be distrustful. Power, very good. But, in the first place, what is power? In the second, whence comes it? The skilful do not seem to hear the murmured objection, and they continue their man≈ìuvres.
U||According to the politicians, who are ingenious in putting the mask of necessity on profitable fictions, the first requirement of a people after a revolution, when this people forms part of a monarchical continent, is to procure for itself a dynasty. In this way, say they, peace, that is to say, time to dress our wounds, and to repair the house, can be had after a revolution. The dynasty conceals the scaffolding and covers the ambulance. Now, it is not always easy to procure a dynasty.
U||If it is absolutely necessary, the first man of genius or even the first man of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the manufacturing of a king. You have, in the first case, Napoleon; in the second, Iturbide.
U||But the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make a dynasty. There is necessarily required a certain modicum of antiquity in a race, and the wrinkle of the centuries cannot be improvised.
U||If we place ourselves at the point of view of the ‚Äústatesmen,‚Äù after making all allowances, of course, after a revolution, what are the qualities of the king which result from it? He may be and it is useful for him to be a revolutionary; that is to say, a participant in his own person in that revolution, that he should have lent a hand to it, that he should have either compromised or distinguished himself therein, that he should have touched the axe or wielded the sword in it.
U||What are the qualities of a dynasty? It should be national; that is to say, revolutionary at a distance, not through acts committed, but by reason of ideas accepted. It should be composed of past and be historic; be composed of future and be sympathetic.
U||All this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves with finding a man, Cromwell or Napoleon; and why the second absolutely insisted on finding a family, the House of Brunswick or the House of Orleans.
U||Royal houses resemble those Indian fig-trees, each branch of which, bending over to the earth, takes root and becomes a fig-tree itself. Each branch may become a dynasty. On the sole condition that it shall bend down to the people.
U||Such is the theory of the skilful.
U||Here, then, lies the great art: to make a little render to success the sound of a catastrophe in order that those who profit by it may tremble from it also, to season with fear every step that is taken, to augment the curve of the transition to the point of retarding progress, to dull that aurora, to denounce and retrench the harshness of enthusiasm, to cut all angles and nails, to wad triumph, to muffle up right, to envelop the giant-people in flannel, and to put it to bed very speedily, to impose a diet on that excess of health, to put Hercules on the treatment of a convalescent, to dilute the event with the expedient, to offer to spirits thirsting for the ideal that nectar thinned out with a potion, to take one‚Äôs precautions against too much success, to garnish the revolution with a shade.
U||1830 practised this theory, already applied to England by 1688.
U||1830 is a revolution arrested midway. Half of progress, quasi-right. Now, logic knows not the ‚Äúalmost,‚Äù absolutely as the sun knows not the candle.
U||Who arrests revolutions half-way? The bourgeoisie?
U||Why?
U||Because the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction. Yesterday it was appetite, to-day it is plenitude, to-morrow it will be satiety.
U||The phenomenon of 1814 after Napoleon was reproduced in 1830 after Charles X.
U||The attempt has been made, and wrongly, to make a class of the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of the people. The bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down. A chair is not a caste.
U||But through a desire to sit down too soon, one may arrest the very march of the human race. This has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie.
U||One is not a class because one has committed a fault. Selfishness is not one of the divisions of the social order.
U||Moreover, we must be just to selfishness. The state to which that part of the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired after the shock of 1830 was not the inertia which is complicated with indifference and laziness, and which contains a little shame; it was not the slumber which presupposes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams; it was the halt.
U||The halt is a word formed of a singular double and almost contradictory sense: a troop on the march, that is to say, movement; a stand, that is to say, repose.
U||The halt is the restoration of forces; it is repose armed and on the alert; it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels and holds itself on its guard.
U||The halt presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat of to-morrow.
U||It is the partition between 1830 and 1848.
U||What we here call combat may also be designated as progress.
U||The bourgeoisie then, as well as the statesmen, required a man who should express this word Halt. An Although-Because. A composite individuality, signifying revolution and signifying stability, in other terms, strengthening the present by the evident compatibility of the past with the future.
U||This man was ‚Äúalready found.‚Äù His name was Louis Philippe d‚ÄôOrleans.
U||The 221 made Louis Philippe King. Lafayette undertook the coronation.
U||He called it the best of republics. The town-hall of Paris took the place of the Cathedral of Rheims.
U||This substitution of a half-throne for a whole throne was ‚Äúthe work of 1830.‚Äù
U||When the skilful had finished, the immense vice of their solution became apparent. All this had been accomplished outside the bounds of absolute right. Absolute right cried: ‚ÄúI protest!‚Äù then, terrible to say, it retired into the darkness.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîLOUIS PHILIPPE
U||Revolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand, they strike firmly and choose well. Even incomplete, even debased and abused and reduced to the state of a junior revolution like the Revolution of 1830, they nearly always retain sufficient providential lucidity to prevent them from falling amiss. Their eclipse is never an abdication.
U||Nevertheless, let us not boast too loudly; revolutions also may be deceived, and grave errors have been seen.
U||Let us return to 1830. 1830, in its deviation, had good luck. In the establishment which entitled itself order after the revolution had been cut short, the King amounted to more than royalty. Louis Philippe was a rare man.
U||The son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuating circumstances, but also as worthy of esteem as that father had been of blame; possessing all private virtues and many public virtues; careful of his health, of his fortune, of his person, of his affairs, knowing the value of a minute and not always the value of a year; sober, serene, peaceable, patient; a good man and a good prince; sleeping with his wife, and having in his palace lackeys charged with the duty of showing the conjugal bed to the bourgeois, an ostentation of the regular sleeping-apartment which had become useful after the former illegitimate displays of the elder branch; knowing all the languages of Europe, and, what is more rare, all the languages of all interests, and speaking them; an admirable representative of the ‚Äúmiddle class,‚Äù but outstripping it, and in every way greater than it; possessing excellent sense, while appreciating the blood from which he had sprung, counting most of all on his intrinsic worth, and, on 
U||the question of his race, very particular, declaring himself Orleans and not Bourbon; thoroughly the first Prince of the Blood Royal while he was still only a Serene Highness, but a frank bourgeois from the day he became king; diffuse in public, concise in private; reputed, but not proved to be a miser; at bottom, one of those economists who are readily prodigal at their own fancy or duty; lettered, but not very sensitive to letters; a gentleman, but not a chevalier; simple, calm, and strong; adored by his family and his household; a fascinating talker, an undeceived statesman, inwardly cold, dominated by immediate interest, always governing at the shortest range, incapable of rancor and of gratitude, making use without mercy of superiority on mediocrity, clever in getting parliamentary majorities to put in the wrong those mysterious unanimities which mutter dully under thrones; unreserved, sometimes imprudent in his lack of reserve, but with marvellous address in that imprudence; fertile in expedients, in c
U||ountenances, in masks; making France fear Europe and Europe France! Incontestably fond of his country, but preferring his family; assuming more domination than authority and more authority than dignity, a disposition which has this unfortunate property, that as it turns everything to success, it admits of ruse and does not absolutely repudiate baseness, but which has this valuable side, that it preserves politics from violent shocks, the state from fractures, and society from catastrophes; minute, correct, vigilant, attentive, sagacious, indefatigable; contradicting himself at times and giving himself the lie; bold against Austria at Ancona, obstinate against England in Spain, bombarding Antwerp, and paying off Pritchard; singing the Marseillaise with conviction, inaccessible to despondency, to lassitude, to the taste for the beautiful and the ideal, to daring generosity, to Utopia, to chim√¶ras, to wrath, to vanity, to fear; possessing all the forms of personal intrepidity; a general at Valmy; a soldier at 
U||Jemappes; attacked eight times by regicides and always smiling. Brave as a grenadier, courageous as a thinker; uneasy only in the face of the chances of a European shaking up, and unfitted for great political adventures; always ready to risk his life, never his work; disguising his will in influence, in order that he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather than as a king; endowed with observation and not with divination; not very attentive to minds, but knowing men, that is to say requiring to see in order to judge; prompt and penetrating good sense, practical wisdom, easy speech, prodigious memory; drawing incessantly on this memory, his only point of resemblance with C√¶sar, Alexander, and Napoleon; knowing deeds, facts, details, dates, proper names, ignorant of tendencies, passions, the diverse geniuses of the crowd, the interior aspirations, the hidden and obscure uprisings of souls, in a word, all that can be designated as the invisible currents of consciences; accepted by the surface, but little in a
U||ccord with France lower down; extricating himself by dint of tact; governing too much and not enough; his own first minister; excellent at creating out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas; mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization, of order and organization, an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery, the founder and lawyer of a dynasty; having something of Charlemagne and something of an attorney; in short, a lofty and original figure, a prince who understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasiness of France, and power in spite of the jealousy of Europe. Louis Philippe will be classed among the eminent men of his century, and would be ranked among the most illustrious governors of history had he loved glory but a little, and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree as the feeling for what is useful.
U||Louis Philippe had been handsome, and in his old age he remained graceful; not always approved by the nation, he always was so by the masses; he pleased. He had that gift of charming. He lacked majesty; he wore no crown, although a king, and no white hair, although an old man; his manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the new; a mixture of the noble and the bourgeois which suited 1830; Louis Philippe was transition reigning; he had preserved the ancient pronunciation and the ancient orthography which he placed at the service of opinions modern; he loved Poland and Hungary, but he wrote les Polonois, and he pronounced les Hongrais. He wore the uniform of the national guard, like Charles X., and the ribbon of the Legion of Honor, like Napoleon.
U||He went a little to chapel, not at all to the chase, never to the opera. Incorruptible by sacristans, by whippers-in, by ballet-dancers; this made a part of his bourgeois popularity. He had no heart. He went out with his umbrella under his arm, and this umbrella long formed a part of his aureole. He was a bit of a mason, a bit of a gardener, something of a doctor; he bled a postilion who had tumbled from his horse; Louis Philippe no more went about without his lancet, than did Henri IV. without his poniard. The Royalists jeered at this ridiculous king, the first who had ever shed blood with the object of healing.
U||For the grievances against Louis Philippe, there is one deduction to be made; there is that which accuses royalty, that which accuses the reign, that which accuses the King; three columns which all give different totals. Democratic right confiscated, progress becomes a matter of secondary interest, the protests of the street violently repressed, military execution of insurrections, the rising passed over by arms, the Rue Transnonain, the counsels of war, the absorption of the real country by the legal country, on half shares with three hundred thousand privileged persons,‚Äîthese are the deeds of royalty; Belgium refused, Algeria too harshly conquered, and, as in the case of India by the English, with more barbarism than civilization, the breach of faith, to Abd-el-Kader, Blaye, Deutz bought, Pritchard paid,‚Äîthese are the doings of the reign; the policy which was more domestic than national was the doing of the King.
U||As will be seen, the proper deduction having been made, the King‚Äôs charge is decreased.
U||This is his great fault; he was modest in the name of France.
U||Whence arises this fault?
U||We will state it.
U||Louis Philippe was rather too much of a paternal king; that incubation of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of everything and does not like to be disturbed; hence excessive timidity, which is displeasing to the people, who have the 14th of July in their civil and Austerlitz in their military tradition.
U||Moreover, if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled first of all, that deep tenderness of Louis Philippe towards his family was deserved by the family. That domestic group was worthy of admiration. Virtues there dwelt side by side with talents. One of Louis Philippe‚Äôs daughters, Marie d‚ÄôOrleans, placed the name of her race among artists, as Charles d‚ÄôOrleans had placed it among poets. She made of her soul a marble which she named Jeanne d‚ÄôArc. Two of Louis Philippe‚Äôs daughters elicited from Metternich this eulogium: ‚ÄúThey are young people such as are rarely seen, and princes such as are never seen.‚Äù
U||This, without any dissimulation, and also without any exaggeration, is the truth about Louis Philippe.
U||To be Prince Equality, to bear in his own person the contradiction of the Restoration and the Revolution, to have that disquieting side of the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power, therein lay the fortune of Louis Philippe in 1830; never was there a more complete adaptation of a man to an event; the one entered into the other, and the incarnation took place. Louis Philippe is 1830 made man. Moreover, he had in his favor that great recommendation to the throne, exile. He had been proscribed, a wanderer, poor. He had lived by his own labor. In Switzerland, this heir to the richest princely domains in France had sold an old horse in order to obtain bread. At Reichenau, he gave lessons in mathematics, while his sister Adelaide did wool work and sewed. These souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie enthusiastic. He had, with his own hands, demolished the iron cage of Mont-Saint-Michel, built by Louis XI., and used by Louis XV. He was the companion of Dumouriez, he was the frie
U||nd of Lafayette; he had belonged to the Jacobins‚Äô club; Mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder; Danton had said to him: ‚ÄúYoung man!‚Äù At the age of four and twenty, in ‚Äô93, being then M. de Chartres, he had witnessed, from the depth of a box, the trial of Louis XVI., so well named that poor tyrant. The blind clairvoyance of the Revolution, breaking royalty in the King and the King with royalty, did so almost without noticing the man in the fierce crushing of the idea, the vast storm of the Assembly-Tribunal, the public wrath interrogating, Capet not knowing what to reply, the alarming, stupefied vacillation by that royal head beneath that sombre breath, the relative innocence of all in that catastrophe, of those who condemned as well as of the man condemned,‚Äîhe had looked on those things, he had contemplated that giddiness; he had seen the centuries appear before the bar of the Assembly-Convention; he had beheld, behind Louis XVI., that unfortunate passer-by who was made responsible, the terrible 
U||culprit, the monarchy, rise through the shadows; and there had lingered in his soul the respectful fear of these immense justices of the populace, which are almost as impersonal as the justice of God.
U||The trace left in him by the Revolution was prodigious. Its memory was like a living imprint of those great years, minute by minute. One day, in the presence of a witness whom we are not permitted to doubt, he rectified from memory the whole of the letter A in the alphabetical list of the Constituent Assembly.
U||Louis Philippe was a king of the broad daylight. While he reigned the press was free, the tribune was free, conscience and speech were free. The laws of September are open to sight. Although fully aware of the gnawing power of light on privileges, he left his throne exposed to the light. History will do justice to him for this loyalty.
U||Louis Philippe, like all historical men who have passed from the scene, is to-day put on his trial by the human conscience. His case is, as yet, only in the lower court.
U||The hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent, has not yet sounded for him; the moment has not come to pronounce a definite judgment on this king; the austere and illustrious historian Louis Blanc has himself recently softened his first verdict; Louis Philippe was elected by those two almosts which are called the 221 and 1830, that is to say, by a half-Parliament, and a half-revolution; and in any case, from the superior point of view where philosophy must place itself, we cannot judge him here, as the reader has seen above, except with certain reservations in the name of the absolute democratic principle; in the eyes of the absolute, outside these two rights, the right of man in the first place, the right of the people in the second, all is usurpation; but what we can say, even at the present day, that after making these reserves is, that to sum up the whole, and in whatever manner he is considered, Louis Philippe, taken in himself, and from the point of view of human goodness, will remain
U||, to use the antique language of ancient history, one of the best princes who ever sat on a throne.
U||What is there against him? That throne. Take away Louis Philippe the king, there remains the man. And the man is good. He is good at times even to the point of being admirable. Often, in the midst of his gravest souvenirs, after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the continent, he returned at night to his apartments, and there, exhausted with fatigue, overwhelmed with sleep, what did he do? He took a death sentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit, considering it something to hold his own against Europe, but that it was a still greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner. He obstinately maintained his opinion against his keeper of the seals; he disputed the ground with the guillotine foot by foot against the crown attorneys, those chatterers of the law, as he called them. Sometimes the pile of sentences covered his table; he examined them all; it was anguish to him to abandon these miserable, condemned heads. One day, he said to the same witness to whom we have recently ref
U||erred: ‚ÄúI won seven last night.‚Äù During the early years of his reign, the death penalty was as good as abolished, and the erection of a scaffold was a violence committed against the King. The Gr√®ve having disappeared with the elder branch, a bourgeois place of execution was instituted under the name of the Barri√®re-Saint-Jacques; ‚Äúpractical men‚Äù felt the necessity of a quasi-legitimate guillotine; and this was one of the victories of Casimir P√©rier, who represented the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie, over Louis Philippe, who represented its liberal sides. Louis Philippe annotated Beccaria with his own hand. After the Fieschi machine, he exclaimed: ‚ÄúWhat a pity that I was not wounded! Then I might have pardoned!‚Äù On another occasion, alluding to the resistance offered by his ministry, he wrote in connection with a political criminal, who is one of the most generous figures of our day: ‚ÄúHis pardon is granted; it only remains for me to obtain it.‚Äù Louis Philippe was as gentle as Louis IX. an
U||d as kindly as Henri IV.
U||Now, to our mind, in history, where kindness is the rarest of pearls, the man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great.
U||Louis Philippe having been severely judged by some, harshly, perhaps, by others, it is quite natural that a man, himself a phantom at the present day, who knew that king, should come and testify in his favor before history; this deposition, whatever else it may be, is evidently and above all things, entirely disinterested; an epitaph penned by a dead man is sincere; one shade may console another shade; the sharing of the same shadows confers the right to praise it; it is not greatly to be feared that it will ever be said of two tombs in exile: ‚ÄúThis one flattered the other.‚Äù
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîCRACKS BENEATH THE FOUNDATION
U||At the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point of penetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which envelop the beginning of Louis Philippe‚Äôs reign, it was necessary that there should be no equivoque, and it became requisite that this book should offer some explanation with regard to this king.
U||Louis Philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority without violence, without any direct action on his part, by virtue of a revolutionary change, evidently quite distinct from the real aim of the Revolution, but in which he, the Duc d‚ÄôOrl√©ans, exercised no personal initiative. He had been born a Prince, and he believed himself to have been elected King. He had not served this mandate on himself; he had not taken it; it had been offered to him, and he had accepted it; convinced, wrongly, to be sure, but convinced nevertheless, that the offer was in accordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in accordance with duty. Hence his possession was in good faith. Now, we say it in good conscience, Louis Philippe being in possession in perfect good faith, and the democracy being in good faith in its attack, the amount of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither on the King nor on the democracy. A clash of principles resembles a clash of elements. The ocean defends the water
U||, the hurricane defends the air, the King defends Royalty, the democracy defends the people; the relative, which is the monarchy, resists the absolute, which is the republic; society bleeds in this conflict, but that which constitutes its suffering to-day will constitute its safety later on; and, in any case, those who combat are not to be blamed; one of the two parties is evidently mistaken; the right is not, like the Colossus of Rhodes, on two shores at once, with one foot on the republic, and one in Royalty; it is indivisible, and all on one side; but those who are in error are so sincerely; a blind man is no more a criminal than a Vendean is a ruffian. Let us, then, impute to the fatality of things alone these formidable collisions. Whatever the nature of these tempests may be, human irresponsibility is mingled with them.
U||Let us complete this exposition.
U||The government of 1840 led a hard life immediately. Born yesterday, it was obliged to fight to-day.
U||Hardly installed, it was already everywhere conscious of vague movements of traction on the apparatus of July so recently laid, and so lacking in solidity.
U||Resistance was born on the morrow; perhaps even, it was born on the preceding evening. From month to month the hostility increased, and from being concealed it became patent.
U||The Revolution of July, which gained but little acceptance outside of France by kings, had been diversely interpreted in France, as we have said.
U||God delivers over to men his visible will in events, an obscure text written in a mysterious tongue. Men immediately make translations of it; translations hasty, incorrect, full of errors, of gaps, and of nonsense. Very few minds comprehend the divine language. The most sagacious, the calmest, the most profound, decipher slowly, and when they arrive with their text, the task has long been completed; there are already twenty translations on the public place. From each remaining springs a party, and from each misinterpretation a faction; and each party thinks that it alone has the true text, and each faction thinks that it possesses the light.
U||Power itself is often a faction.
U||There are, in revolutions, swimmers who go against the current; they are the old parties.
U||For the old parties who clung to heredity by the grace of God, think that revolutions, having sprung from the right to revolt, one has the right to revolt against them. Error. For in these revolutions, the one who revolts is not the people; it is the king. Revolution is precisely the contrary of revolt. Every revolution, being a normal outcome, contains within itself its legitimacy, which false revolutionists sometimes dishonor, but which remains even when soiled, which survives even when stained with blood.
U||Revolutions spring not from an accident, but from necessity. A revolution is a return from the fictitious to the real. It is because it must be that it is.
U||Nonetheless did the old legitimist parties assail the Revolution of 1830 with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning. Errors make excellent projectiles. They strike it cleverly in its vulnerable spot, in default of a cuirass, in its lack of logic; they attacked this revolution in its royalty. They shouted to it: ‚ÄúRevolution, why this king?‚Äù Factions are blind men who aim correctly.
U||This cry was uttered equally by the republicans. But coming from them, this cry was logical. What was blindness in the legitimists was clearness of vision in the democrats. 1830 had bankrupted the people. The enraged democracy reproached it with this.
U||Between the attack of the past and the attack of the future, the establishment of July struggled. It represented the minute at loggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical centuries, on the other hand with eternal right.
U||In addition, and beside all this, as it was no longer revolution and had become a monarchy, 1830 was obliged to take precedence of all Europe. To keep the peace, was an increase of complication. A harmony established contrary to sense is often more onerous than a war. From this secret conflict, always muzzled, but always growling, was born armed peace, that ruinous expedient of civilization which in the harness of the European cabinets is suspicious in itself. The Royalty of July reared up, in spite of the fact that it caught it in the harness of European cabinets. Metternich would gladly have put it in kicking-straps. Pushed on in France by progress, it pushed on the monarchies, those loiterers in Europe. After having been towed, it undertook to tow.
U||Meanwhile, within her, pauperism, the proletariat, salary, education, penal servitude, prostitution, the fate of the woman, wealth, misery, production, consumption, division, exchange, coin, credit, the rights of capital, the rights of labor,‚Äîall these questions were multiplied above society, a terrible slope.
U||Outside of political parties properly so called, another movement became manifest. Philosophical fermentation replied to democratic fermentation. The elect felt troubled as well as the masses; in another manner, but quite as much.
U||Thinkers meditated, while the soil, that is to say, the people, traversed by revolutionary currents, trembled under them with indescribably vague epileptic shocks. These dreamers, some isolated, others united in families and almost in communion, turned over social questions in a pacific but profound manner; impassive miners, who tranquilly pushed their galleries into the depths of a volcano, hardly disturbed by the dull commotion and the furnaces of which they caught glimpses.
U||This tranquillity was not the least beautiful spectacle of this agitated epoch.
U||These men left to political parties the question of rights, they occupied themselves with the question of happiness.
U||The well-being of man, that was what they wanted to extract from society.
U||They raised material questions, questions of agriculture, of industry, of commerce, almost to the dignity of a religion. In civilization, such as it has formed itself, a little by the command of God, a great deal by the agency of man, interests combine, unite, and amalgamate in a manner to form a veritable hard rock, in accordance with a dynamic law, patiently studied by economists, those geologists of politics. These men who grouped themselves under different appellations, but who may all be designated by the generic title of socialists, endeavored to pierce that rock and to cause it to spout forth the living waters of human felicity.
U||From the question of the scaffold to the question of war, their works embraced everything. To the rights of man, as proclaimed by the French Revolution, they added the rights of woman and the rights of the child.
U||The reader will not be surprised if, for various reasons, we do not here treat in a thorough manner, from the theoretical point of view, the questions raised by socialism. We confine ourselves to indicating them.
U||All the problems that the socialists proposed to themselves, cosmogonic visions, reverie and mysticism being cast aside, can be reduced to two principal problems.
U||First problem: To produce wealth.
U||Second problem: To share it.
U||The first problem contains the question of work.
U||The second contains the question of salary.
U||In the first problem the employment of forces is in question.
U||In the second, the distribution of enjoyment.
U||From the proper employment of forces results public power.
U||From a good distribution of enjoyments results individual happiness.
U||By a good distribution, not an equal but an equitable distribution must be understood.
U||From these two things combined, the public power without, individual happiness within, results social prosperity.
U||Social prosperity means the man happy, the citizen free, the nation great.
U||England solves the first of these two problems. She creates wealth admirably, she divides it badly. This solution which is complete on one side only leads her fatally to two extremes: monstrous opulence, monstrous wretchedness. All enjoyments for some, all privations for the rest, that is to say, for the people; privilege, exception, monopoly, feudalism, born from toil itself. A false and dangerous situation, which sates public power or private misery, which sets the roots of the State in the sufferings of the individual. A badly constituted grandeur in which are combined all the material elements and into which no moral element enters.
U||Communism and agrarian law think that they solve the second problem. They are mistaken. Their division kills production. Equal partition abolishes emulation; and consequently labor. It is a partition made by the butcher, which kills that which it divides. It is therefore impossible to pause over these pretended solutions. Slaying wealth is not the same thing as dividing it.
U||The two problems require to be solved together, to be well solved. The two problems must be combined and made but one.
U||Solve only the first of the two problems; you will be Venice, you will be England. You will have, like Venice, an artificial power, or, like England, a material power; you will be the wicked rich man. You will die by an act of violence, as Venice died, or by bankruptcy, as England will fall. And the world will allow to die and fall all that is merely selfishness, all that does not represent for the human race either a virtue or an idea.
U||It is well understood here, that by the words Venice, England, we designate not the peoples, but social structures; the oligarchies superposed on nations, and not the nations themselves. The nations always have our respect and our sympathy. Venice, as a people, will live again; England, the aristocracy, will fall, but England, the nation, is immortal. That said, we continue.
U||Solve the two problems, encourage the wealthy, and protect the poor, suppress misery, put an end to the unjust farming out of the feeble by the strong, put a bridle on the iniquitous jealousy of the man who is making his way against the man who has reached the goal, adjust, mathematically and fraternally, salary to labor, mingle gratuitous and compulsory education with the growth of childhood, and make of science the base of manliness, develop minds while keeping arms busy, be at one and the same time a powerful people and a family of happy men, render property democratic, not by abolishing it, but by making it universal, so that every citizen, without exception, may be a proprietor, an easier matter than is generally supposed; in two words, learn how to produce wealth and how to distribute it, and you will have at once moral and material greatness; and you will be worthy to call yourself France.
U||This is what socialism said outside and above a few sects which have gone astray; that is what it sought in facts, that is what it sketched out in minds.
U||Efforts worthy of admiration! Sacred attempts!
U||These doctrines, these theories, these resistances, the unforeseen necessity for the statesman to take philosophers into account, confused evidences of which we catch a glimpse, a new system of politics to be created, which shall be in accord with the old world without too much disaccord with the new revolutionary ideal, a situation in which it became necessary to use Lafayette to defend Polignac, the intuition of progress transparent beneath the revolt, the chambers and streets, the competitions to be brought into equilibrium around him, his faith in the Revolution, perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation born of the vague acceptance of a superior definitive right, his desire to remain of his race, his domestic spirit, his sincere respect for the people, his own honesty, preoccupied Louis Philippe almost painfully, and there were moments when strong and courageous as he was, he was overwhelmed by the difficulties of being a king.
U||He felt under his feet a formidable disaggregation, which was not, nevertheless, a reduction to dust, France being more France than ever.
U||Piles of shadows covered the horizon. A strange shade, gradually drawing nearer, extended little by little over men, over things, over ideas; a shade which came from wraths and systems. Everything which had been hastily stifled was moving and fermenting. At times the conscience of the honest man resumed its breathing, so great was the discomfort of that air in which sophisms were intermingled with truths. Spirits trembled in the social anxiety like leaves at the approach of a storm. The electric tension was such that at certain instants, the first comer, a stranger, brought light. Then the twilight obscurity closed in again. At intervals, deep and dull mutterings allowed a judgment to be formed as to the quantity of thunder contained by the cloud.
U||Twenty months had barely elapsed since the Revolution of July, the year 1832 had opened with an aspect of something impending and threatening.
U||The distress of the people, the laborers without bread, the last Prince de Cond√© engulfed in the shadows, Brussels expelling the Nassaus as Paris did the Bourbons, Belgium offering herself to a French Prince and giving herself to an English Prince, the Russian hatred of Nicolas, behind us the demons of the South, Ferdinand in Spain, Miguel in Portugal, the earth quaking in Italy, Metternich extending his hand over Bologna, France treating Austria sharply at Ancona, at the North no one knew what sinister sound of the hammer nailing up Poland in her coffin, irritated glances watching France narrowly all over Europe, England, a suspected ally, ready to give a push to that which was tottering and to hurl herself on that which should fall, the peerage sheltering itself behind Beccaria to refuse four heads to the law, the fleurs-de-lys erased from the King‚Äôs carriage, the cross torn from Notre Dame, Lafayette lessened, Laffitte ruined, Benjamin Constant dead in indigence, Casimir P√©rier dead in the exhaustion 
U||of his power; political and social malady breaking out simultaneously in the two capitals of the kingdom, the one in the city of thought, the other in the city of toil; at Paris civil war, at Lyons servile war; in the two cities, the same glare of the furnace; a crater-like crimson on the brow of the people; the South rendered fanatic, the West troubled, the Duchesse de Berry in la Vend√©e, plots, conspiracies, risings, cholera, added the sombre roar of tumult of events to the sombre roar of ideas.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîFACTS WHENCE HISTORY SPRINGS AND WHICH HISTORY IGNORES
U||Towards the end of April, everything had become aggravated. The fermentation entered the boiling state. Ever since 1830, petty partial revolts had been going on here and there, which were quickly suppressed, but ever bursting forth afresh, the sign of a vast underlying conflagration. Something terrible was in preparation. Glimpses could be caught of the features still indistinct and imperfectly lighted, of a possible revolution. France kept an eye on Paris; Paris kept an eye on the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.
U||The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which was in a dull glow, was beginning its ebullition.
U||A Street Orator
U||The wine-shops of the Rue de Charonne were, although the union of the two epithets seems singular when applied to wine-shops, grave and stormy.
U||The government was there purely and simply called in question. There people publicly discussed the question of fighting or of keeping quiet. There were back shops where workingmen were made to swear that they would hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm, and ‚Äúthat they would fight without counting the number of the enemy.‚Äù This engagement once entered into, a man seated in the corner of the wine-shop ‚Äúassumed a sonorous tone,‚Äù and said, ‚ÄúYou understand! You have sworn!‚Äù
U||Sometimes they went upstairs, to a private room on the first floor, and there scenes that were almost masonic were enacted. They made the initiated take oaths to render service to himself as well as to the fathers of families. That was the formula.
U||In the tap-rooms, ‚Äúsubversive‚Äù pamphlets were read. They treated the government with contempt, says a secret report of that time.
U||Words like the following could be heard there:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the names of the leaders. We folks shall not know the day until two hours beforehand.‚Äù One workman said: ‚ÄúThere are three hundred of us, let each contribute ten sous, that will make one hundred and fifty francs with which to procure powder and shot.‚Äù
U||Another said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ask for six months, I don‚Äôt ask for even two. In less than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government. With twenty-five thousand men we can face them.‚Äù Another said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt sleep at night, because I make cartridges all night.‚Äù From time to time, men ‚Äúof bourgeois appearance, and in good coats‚Äù came and ‚Äúcaused embarrassment,‚Äù and with the air of ‚Äúcommand,‚Äù shook hands with the most important, and then went away. They never stayed more than ten minutes. Significant remarks were exchanged in a low tone: ‚ÄúThe plot is ripe, the matter is arranged.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt was murmured by all who were there,‚Äù to borrow the very expression of one of those who were present. The exaltation was such that one day, a workingman exclaimed, before the whole wine-shop: ‚ÄúWe have no arms!‚Äù One of his comrades replied: ‚ÄúThe soldiers have!‚Äù thus parodying without being aware of the fact, Bonaparte‚Äôs proclamation to the army in Italy: ‚ÄúWhen they had anything of a mor
U||e secret nature on hand,‚Äù adds one report, ‚Äúthey did not communicate it to each other.‚Äù It is not easy to understand what they could conceal after what they said.
U||These reunions were sometimes periodical. At certain ones of them, there were never more than eight or ten persons present, and they were always the same. In others, any one entered who wished, and the room was so full that they were forced to stand. Some went thither through enthusiasm and passion; others because it was on their way to their work. As during the Revolution, there were patriotic women in some of these wine-shops who embraced newcomers.
U||Other expressive facts came to light.
U||A man would enter a shop, drink, and go his way with the remark: ‚ÄúWine-merchant, the revolution will pay what is due to you.‚Äù
U||Revolutionary agents were appointed in a wine-shop facing the Rue de Charonne. The balloting was carried on in their caps.
U||Workingmen met at the house of a fencing-master who gave lessons in the Rue de Cotte. There there was a trophy of arms formed of wooden broadswords, canes, clubs, and foils. One day, the buttons were removed from the foils.
U||A workman said: ‚ÄúThere are twenty-five of us, but they don‚Äôt count on me, because I am looked upon as a machine.‚Äù Later on, that machine became Quenisset.
U||The indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired a strange and indescribable notoriety. A woman sweeping off her doorsteps said to another woman: ‚ÄúFor a long time, there has been a strong force busy making cartridges.‚Äù In the open street, proclamation could be seen addressed to the National Guard in the departments. One of these proclamations was signed: Burtot, wine-merchant.
U||One day a man with his beard worn like a collar and with an Italian accent mounted a stone post at the door of a liquor-seller in the March√© Lenoir, and read aloud a singular document, which seemed to emanate from an occult power. Groups formed around him, and applauded.
U||The passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected and noted down. ‚Äú‚ÄîOur doctrines are trammelled, our proclamations torn, our bill-stickers are spied upon and thrown into prison.‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúThe breakdown which has recently taken place in cottons has converted to us many mediums.‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúThe future of nations is being worked out in our obscure ranks.‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúHere are the fixed terms: action or reaction, revolution or counter-revolution. For, at our epoch, we no longer believe either in inertia or in immobility. For the people against the people, that is the question. There is no other.‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúOn the day when we cease to suit you, break us, but up to that day, help us to march on.‚Äù All this in broad daylight.
U||Other deeds, more audacious still, were suspicious in the eyes of the people by reason of their very audacity. On the 4th of April, 1832, a passer-by mounted the post on the corner which forms the angle of the Rue Sainte-Marguerite and shouted: ‚ÄúI am a Babouvist!‚Äù But beneath Babeuf, the people scented Gisquet.
U||Among other things, this man said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDown with property! The opposition of the left is cowardly and treacherous. When it wants to be on the right side, it preaches revolution, it is democratic in order to escape being beaten, and royalist so that it may not have to fight. The republicans are beasts with feathers. Distrust the republicans, citizens of the laboring classes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSilence, citizen spy!‚Äù cried an artisan.
U||This shout put an end to the discourse.
U||Mysterious incidents occurred.
U||At nightfall, a workingman encountered near the canal a ‚Äúvery well dressed man,‚Äù who said to him: ‚ÄúWhither are you bound, citizen?‚Äù ‚ÄúSir,‚Äù replied the workingman, ‚ÄúI have not the honor of your acquaintance.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know you very well, however.‚Äù And the man added: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be alarmed, I am an agent of the committee. You are suspected of not being quite faithful. You know that if you reveal anything, there is an eye fixed on you.‚Äù Then he shook hands with the workingman and went away, saying: ‚ÄúWe shall meet again soon.‚Äù
U||The police, who were on the alert, collected singular dialogues, not only in the wine-shops, but in the street.
U||‚ÄúGet yourself received very soon,‚Äù said a weaver to a cabinet-maker.
U||‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThere is going to be a shot to fire.‚Äù
U||Two ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies, fraught with evident Jacquerie:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWho governs us?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúM. Philippe.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo, it is the bourgeoisie.‚Äù
U||The reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word Jacquerie in a bad sense. The Jacques were the poor.
U||On another occasion two men were heard to say to each other as they passed by: ‚ÄúWe have a good plan of attack.‚Äù
U||Only the following was caught of a private conversation between four men who were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the Barri√®re du Tr√¥ne:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúEverything possible will be done to prevent his walking about Paris any more.‚Äù
U||Who was the he? Menacing obscurity.
U||‚ÄúThe principal leaders,‚Äù as they said in the faubourg, held themselves apart. It was supposed that they met for consultation in a wine-shop near the point Saint-Eustache. A certain Aug‚Äî, chief of the Society aid for tailors, Rue Mond√©tour, had the reputation of serving as intermediary central between the leaders and the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.
U||Nevertheless, there was always a great deal of mystery about these leaders, and no certain fact can invalidate the singular arrogance of this reply made later on by a man accused before the Court of Peers:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWho was your leader?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI knew of none and I recognized none.‚Äù
U||There was nothing but words, transparent but vague; sometimes idle reports, rumors, hearsay. Other indications cropped up.
U||A carpenter, occupied in nailing boards to a fence around the ground on which a house was in process of construction, in the Rue de Reuilly found on that plot the torn fragment of a letter on which were still legible the following lines:‚Äî
U||The committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in the sections for the different societies.
U||And, as a postscript:‚Äî
U||We have learned that there are guns in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonni√®re, No. 5 [bis], to the number of five or six thousand, in the house of a gunsmith in that court. The section owns no arms.
U||What excited the carpenter and caused him to show this thing to his neighbors was the fact, that a few paces further on he picked up another paper, torn like the first, and still more significant, of which we reproduce a facsimile, because of the historical interest attaching to these strange documents:‚Äî
U||[Illustration: Q C D E Learn this list by heart. After so doing you will tear it up. The men admitted will do the same when you have transmitted their orders to them. Health and Fraternity, u og a‚Äô fe L.]
U||Q C D E
U||Learn this list by heart. After so doing you will tear it up. The men admitted will do the same when you have transmitted their orders to them.
U||Health and Fraternity,
U||u og a‚Äô fe
U||L.
U||It was only later on that the persons who were in the secret of this find at the time, learned the significance of those four capital letters: quinturions, centurions, decurions, √©claireurs [scouts], and the sense of the letters: u og a‚Äô fe, which was a date, and meant April 15th, 1832. Under each capital letter were inscribed names followed by very characteristic notes. Thus: Q. Bannerel. 8 guns, 83 cartridges. A safe man.‚ÄîC. Boubi√®re. 1 pistol, 40 cartridges.‚ÄîD. Rollet. 1 foil, 1 pistol, 1 pound of powder.‚ÄîE. Tessier. 1 sword, 1 cartridge-box. Exact.‚Äî Terreur. 8 guns. Brave, etc.
U||Finally, this carpenter found, still in the same enclosure, a third paper on which was written in pencil, but very legibly, this sort of enigmatical list:‚Äî
U||Unit√©: Blanchard: Arbre-Sec. 6.
U||Barra. Soize. Salle-au-Comte.
U||Kosciusko. Aubry the Butcher?
U||J. J. R.
U||Caius Gracchus.
U||Right of revision. Dufond. Four.
U||Fall of the Girondists. Derbac. Maubu√©e.
U||Washington. Pinson. 1 pistol, 86 cartridges.
U||Marseillaise.
U||Sovereignty of the people. Michel. Quincampoix. Sword.
U||Hoche.
U||Marceau. Plato. Arbre-Sec.
U||Warsaw. Tilly, crier of the Populaire.
U||The honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew its significance. It appears that this list was the complete nomenclature of the sections of the fourth arondissement of the Society of the Rights of Man, with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections. To-day, when all these facts which were obscure are nothing more than history, we may publish them. It should be added, that the foundation of the Society of the Rights of Man seems to have been posterior to the date when this paper was found. Perhaps this was only a rough draft.
U||Still, according to all the remarks and the words, according to written notes, material facts begin to make their appearance.
U||In the Rue Popincourt, in the house of a dealer in bric-√†-brac, there were seized seven sheets of gray paper, all folded alike lengthwise and in four; these sheets enclosed twenty-six squares of this same gray paper folded in the form of a cartridge, and a card, on which was written the following:‚Äî
U||Saltpetre . . . . . . . . . . . 12 ounces.
U||Sulphur . . . . . . . . . . . 2 ounces.
U||Charcoal . . . . . . . . . . . 2 ounces and a half.
U||Water . . . . . . . . . . . 2 ounces.
U||The report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled a strong smell of powder.
U||A mason returning from his day‚Äôs work, left behind him a little package on a bench near the bridge of Austerlitz. This package was taken to the police station. It was opened, and in it were found two printed dialogues, signed Lahauti√®re, a song entitled: ‚ÄúWorkmen, band together,‚Äù and a tin box full of cartridges.
U||One artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him to see how warm he was; the other man felt a pistol under his waistcoat.
U||In a ditch on the boulevard, between P√®re-Lachaise and the Barri√®re du Tr√¥ne, at the most deserted spot, some children, while playing, discovered beneath a mass of shavings and refuse bits of wood, a bag containing a bullet-mould, a wooden punch for the preparation of cartridges, a wooden bowl, in which there were grains of hunting-powder, and a little cast-iron pot whose interior presented evident traces of melted lead.
U||Police agents, making their way suddenly and unexpectedly at five o‚Äôclock in the morning, into the dwelling of a certain Pardon, who was afterwards a member of the Barricade-Merry section and got himself killed in the insurrection of April, 1834, found him standing near his bed, and holding in his hand some cartridges which he was in the act of preparing.
U||Towards the hour when workingmen repose, two men were seen to meet between the Barri√®re Picpus and the Barri√®re Charenton in a little lane between two walls, near a wine-shop, in front of which there was a ‚ÄúJeu de Siam.‚Äù33 One drew a pistol from beneath his blouse and handed it to the other. As he was handing it to him, he noticed that the perspiration of his chest had made the powder damp. He primed the pistol and added more powder to what was already in the pan. Then the two men parted.
U||A certain Gallais, afterwards killed in the Rue Beaubourg in the affair of April, boasted of having in his house seven hundred cartridges and twenty-four flints.
U||The government one day received a warning that arms and two hundred thousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg. On the following week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed. The remarkable point about it was, that the police were not able to seize a single one.
U||An intercepted letter read: ‚ÄúThe day is not far distant when, within four hours by the clock, eighty thousand patriots will be under arms.‚Äù
U||All this fermentation was public, one might almost say tranquil. The approaching insurrection was preparing its storm calmly in the face of the government. No singularity was lacking to this still subterranean crisis, which was already perceptible. The bourgeois talked peaceably to the working-classes of what was in preparation. They said: ‚ÄúHow is the rising coming along?‚Äù in the same tone in which they would have said: ‚ÄúHow is your wife?‚Äù
U||A furniture-dealer, of the Rue Moreau, inquired: ‚ÄúWell, when are you going to make the attack?‚Äù
U||Another shop-keeper said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe attack will be made soon.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI know it. A month ago, there were fifteen thousand of you, now there are twenty-five thousand.‚Äù He offered his gun, and a neighbor offered a small pistol which he was willing to sell for seven francs.
U||Moreover, the revolutionary fever was growing. Not a point in Paris nor in France was exempt from it. The artery was beating everywhere. Like those membranes which arise from certain inflammations and form in the human body, the network of secret societies began to spread all over the country. From the associations of the Friends of the People, which was at the same time public and secret, sprang the Society of the Rights of Man, which also dated from one of the orders of the day: Pluvi√¥se, Year 40 of the republican era, which was destined to survive even the mandate of the Court of Assizes which pronounced its dissolution, and which did not hesitate to bestow on its sections significant names like the following:‚Äî
U||Pikes.
U||Tocsin.
U||Signal cannon.
U||Phrygian cap.
U||January 21.
U||The beggars.
U||The vagabonds.
U||Forward march.
U||Robespierre.
U||Level.
U||√áa Ira.
U||The Society of the Rights of Man engendered the Society of Action. These were impatient individuals who broke away and hastened ahead. Other associations sought to recruit themselves from the great mother societies. The members of sections complained that they were torn asunder. Thus, the Gallic Society, and the committee of organization of the Municipalities. Thus the associations for the liberty of the press, for individual liberty, for the instruction of the people against indirect taxes. Then the Society of Equal Workingmen which was divided into three fractions, the levellers, the communists, the reformers. Then the Army of the Bastilles, a sort of cohort organized on a military footing, four men commanded by a corporal, ten by a sergeant, twenty by a sub-lieutenant, forty by a lieutenant; there were never more than five men who knew each other. Creation where precaution is combined with audacity and which seemed stamped with the genius of Venice.
U||The central committee, which was at the head, had two arms, the Society of Action, and the Army of the Bastilles.
U||A legitimist association, the Chevaliers of Fidelity, stirred about among these the republican affiliations. It was denounced and repudiated there.
U||The Parisian societies had ramifications in the principal cities, Lyons, Nantes, Lille, Marseilles, and each had its Society of the Rights of Man, the Charbonni√®re, and The Free Men. All had a revolutionary society which was called the Cougourde. We have already mentioned this word.
U||In Paris, the Faubourg Saint-Marceau kept up an equal buzzing with the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and the schools were no less moved than the faubourgs. A caf√© in the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe and the wine-shop of the Seven Billiards, Rue des Mathurins-Saint-Jacques, served as rallying points for the students. The Society of the Friends of the A B C affiliated to the Mutualists of Angers, and to the Cougourde of Aix, met, as we have seen, in the Caf√© Musain. These same young men assembled also, as we have stated already, in a restaurant wine-shop of the Rue Mond√©tour which was called Corinthe. These meetings were secret. Others were as public as possible, and the reader can judge of their boldness from these fragments of an interrogatory undergone in one of the ulterior prosecutions: ‚ÄúWhere was this meeting held?‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the Rue de la Paix.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt whose house?‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the street.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat sections were there?‚Äù ‚ÄúOnly one.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhich?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Manuel section.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho was its leader?‚Äù ‚ÄúI.‚Äù ‚ÄúYo
U||u are too young to have decided alone upon the bold course of attacking the government. Where did your instructions come from?‚Äù ‚ÄúFrom the central committee.‚Äù
U||The army was mined at the same time as the population, as was proved subsequently by the operations of B√©ford, Luneville, and √âpinard. They counted on the fifty-second regiment, on the fifth, on the eighth, on the thirty-seventh, and on the twentieth light cavalry. In Burgundy and in the southern towns they planted the liberty tree; that is to say, a pole surmounted by a red cap.
U||Such was the situation.
U||The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, more than any other group of the population, as we stated in the beginning, accentuated this situation and made it felt. That was the sore point. This old faubourg, peopled like an ant-hill, laborious, courageous, and angry as a hive of bees, was quivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult. Everything was in a state of agitation there, without any interruption, however, of the regular work. It is impossible to convey an idea of this lively yet sombre physiognomy. In this faubourg exists poignant distress hidden under attic roofs; there also exist rare and ardent minds. It is particularly in the matter of distress and intelligence that it is dangerous to have extremes meet.
U||The Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also other causes to tremble; for it received the counter-shock of commercial crises, of failures, strikes, slack seasons, all inherent to great political disturbances. In times of revolution misery is both cause and effect. The blow which it deals rebounds upon it. This population full of proud virtue, capable to the highest degree of latent heat, always ready to fly to arms, prompt to explode, irritated, deep, undermined, seemed to be only awaiting the fall of a spark. Whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chased by the wind of events, it is impossible not to think of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at the very gates of Paris that powder-house of suffering and ideas.
U||The wine-shops of the Faubourg Antoine, which have been more than once drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused, possess historical notoriety. In troublous times people grow intoxicated there more on words than on wine. A sort of prophetic spirit and an afflatus of the future circulates there, swelling hearts and enlarging souls. The cabarets of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine resemble those taverns of Mont Aventine erected on the cave of the Sibyl and communicating with the profound and sacred breath; taverns where the tables were almost tripods, and where was drunk what Ennius calls the sibylline wine.
U||The Faubourg Saint-Antoine is a reservoir of people. Revolutionary agitations create fissures there, through which trickles the popular sovereignty. This sovereignty may do evil; it can be mistaken like any other; but, even when led astray, it remains great. We may say of it as of the blind cyclops, Ingens.
U||In ‚Äô93, according as the idea which was floating about was good or evil, according as it was the day of fanaticism or of enthusiasm, there leaped forth from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine now savage legions, now heroic bands.
U||Savage. Let us explain this word. When these bristling men, who in the early days of the revolutionary chaos, tattered, howling, wild, with uplifted bludgeon, pike on high, hurled themselves upon ancient Paris in an uproar, what did they want? They wanted an end to oppression, an end to tyranny, an end to the sword, work for men, instruction for the child, social sweetness for the woman, liberty, equality, fraternity, bread for all, the idea for all, the Edenizing of the world. Progress; and that holy, sweet, and good thing, progress, they claimed in terrible wise, driven to extremities as they were, half naked, club in fist, a roar in their mouths. They were savages, yes; but the savages of civilization.
U||They proclaimed right furiously; they were desirous, if only with fear and trembling, to force the human race to paradise. They seemed barbarians, and they were saviours. They demanded light with the mask of night.
U||Facing these men, who were ferocious, we admit, and terrifying, but ferocious and terrifying for good ends, there are other men, smiling, embroidered, gilded, beribboned, starred, in silk stockings, in white plumes, in yellow gloves, in varnished shoes, who, with their elbows on a velvet table, beside a marble chimney-piece, insist gently on demeanor and the preservation of the past, of the Middle Ages, of divine right, of fanaticism, of innocence, of slavery, of the death penalty, of war, glorifying in low tones and with politeness, the sword, the stake, and the scaffold. For our part, if we were forced to make a choice between the barbarians of civilization and the civilized men of barbarism, we should choose the barbarians.
U||But, thank Heaven, still another choice is possible. No perpendicular fall is necessary, in front any more than in the rear.
U||Neither despotism nor terrorism. We desire progress with a gentle slope.
U||God takes care of that. God‚Äôs whole policy consists in rendering slopes less steep.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîENJOLRAS AND HIS LIEUTENANTS
U||It was about this epoch that Enjolras, in view of a possible catastrophe, instituted a kind of mysterious census.
U||All were present at a secret meeting at the Caf√© Musain.
U||Enjolras said, mixing his words with a few half-enigmatical but significant metaphors:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIt is proper that we should know where we stand and on whom we may count. If combatants are required, they must be provided. It can do no harm to have something with which to strike. Passers-by always have more chance of being gored when there are bulls on the road than when there are none. Let us, therefore, reckon a little on the herd. How many of us are there? There is no question of postponing this task until to-morrow. Revolutionists should always be hurried; progress has no time to lose. Let us mistrust the unexpected. Let us not be caught unprepared. We must go over all the seams that we have made and see whether they hold fast. This business ought to be concluded to-day. Courfeyrac, you will see the polytechnic students. It is their day to go out. To-day is Wednesday. Feuilly, you will see those of the Glaci√®re, will you not? Combeferre has promised me to go to Picpus. There is a perfect swarm and an excellent one there. Bahorel will visit the Estrapade. Prouvaire, the masons are growing lukewarm
U||; you will bring us news from the lodge of the Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honor√©. Joly will go to Dupuytren‚Äôs clinical lecture, and feel the pulse of the medical school. Bossuet will take a little turn in the court and talk with the young law licentiates. I will take charge of the Cougourde myself.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat arranges everything,‚Äù said Courfeyrac.
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat else is there?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA very important thing.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù asked Courfeyrac.
U||‚ÄúThe Barri√®re du Maine,‚Äù replied Enjolras.
U||Enjolras remained for a moment as though absorbed in reflection, then he resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAt the Barri√®re du Maine there are marble-workers, painters, and journeymen in the studios of sculptors. They are an enthusiastic family, but liable to cool off. I don‚Äôt know what has been the matter with them for some time past. They are thinking of something else. They are becoming extinguished. They pass their time playing dominoes. There is urgent need that some one should go and talk with them a little, but with firmness. They meet at Richefeu‚Äôs. They are to be found there between twelve and one o‚Äôclock. Those ashes must be fanned into a glow. For that errand I had counted on that abstracted Marius, who is a good fellow on the whole, but he no longer comes to us. I need some one for the Barri√®re du Maine. I have no one.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat about me?‚Äù said Grantaire. ‚ÄúHere am I.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou indoctrinate republicans! you warm up hearts that have grown cold in the name of principle!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAre you good for anything?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have a vague ambition in that direction,‚Äù said Grantaire.
U||‚ÄúYou do not believe in everything.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI believe in you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúGrantaire will you do me a service?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAnything. I‚Äôll black your boots.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt meddle with our affairs. Sleep yourself sober from your absinthe.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are an ingrate, Enjolras.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou the man to go to the Barri√®re du Maine! You capable of it!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI am capable of descending the Rue de Gr√®s, of crossing the Place Saint-Michel, of sloping through the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, of taking the Rue de Vaugirard, of passing the Carmelites, of turning into the Rue d‚ÄôAssas, of reaching the Rue du Cherche-Midi, of leaving behind me the Conseil de Guerre, of pacing the Rue des Vieilles-Tuileries, of striding across the boulevard, of following the Chauss√©e du Maine, of passing the barrier, and entering Richefeu‚Äôs. I am capable of that. My shoes are capable of that.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDo you know anything of those comrades who meet at Richefeu‚Äôs?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNot much. We only address each other as thou.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat will you say to them?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will speak to them of Robespierre, pardi! Of Danton. Of principles.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI. But I don‚Äôt receive justice. When I set about it, I am terrible. I have read Prudhomme, I know the Social Contract, I know my constitution of the year Two by heart. ‚ÄòThe liberty of one citizen ends where the liberty of another citizen begins.‚Äô Do you take me for a brute? I have an old bank-bill of the Republic in my drawer. The Rights of Man, the sovereignty of the people, sapristi! I am even a bit of a H√©bertist. I can talk the most superb twaddle for six hours by the clock, watch in hand.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBe serious,‚Äù said Enjolras.
U||‚ÄúI am wild,‚Äù replied Grantaire.
U||Enjolras meditated for a few moments, and made the gesture of a man who has taken a resolution.
U||‚ÄúGrantaire,‚Äù he said gravely, ‚ÄúI consent to try you. You shall go to the Barri√®re du Maine.‚Äù
U||Grantaire lived in furnished lodgings very near the Caf√© Musain. He went out, and five minutes later he returned. He had gone home to put on a Robespierre waistcoat.
U||‚ÄúRed,‚Äù said he as he entered, and he looked intently at Enjolras. Then, with the palm of his energetic hand, he laid the two scarlet points of the waistcoat across his breast.
U||And stepping up to Enjolras, he whispered in his ear:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBe easy.‚Äù
U||He jammed his hat on resolutely and departed.
U||A quarter of an hour later, the back room of the Caf√© Musain was deserted. All the friends of the A B C were gone, each in his own direction, each to his own task. Enjolras, who had reserved the Cougourde of Aix for himself, was the last to leave.
U||Those members of the Cougourde of Aix who were in Paris then met on the plain of Issy, in one of the abandoned quarries which are so numerous in that side of Paris.
U||As Enjolras walked towards this place, he passed the whole situation in review in his own mind. The gravity of events was self-evident. When facts, the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady, move heavily, the slightest complication stops and entangles them. A phenomenon whence arises ruin and new births. Enjolras descried a luminous uplifting beneath the gloomy skirts of the future. Who knows? Perhaps the moment was at hand. The people were again taking possession of right, and what a fine spectacle! The revolution was again majestically taking possession of France and saying to the world: ‚ÄúThe sequel to-morrow!‚Äù Enjolras was content. The furnace was being heated. He had at that moment a powder train of friends scattered all over Paris. He composed, in his own mind, with Combeferre‚Äôs philosophical and penetrating eloquence, Feuilly‚Äôs cosmopolitan enthusiasm, Courfeyrac‚Äôs dash, Bahorel‚Äôs smile, Jean Prouvaire‚Äôs melancholy, Joly‚Äôs science, Bossuet‚Äôs sarcasms, a sort of electric spark w
U||hich took fire nearly everywhere at once. All hands to work. Surely, the result would answer to the effort. This was well. This made him think of Grantaire.
U||‚ÄúHold,‚Äù said he to himself, ‚Äúthe Barri√®re du Maine will not take me far out of my way. What if I were to go on as far as Richefeu‚Äôs? Let us have a look at what Grantaire is about, and see how he is getting on.‚Äù
U||One o‚Äôclock was striking from the Vaugirard steeple when Enjolras reached the Richefeu smoking-room.
U||He pushed open the door, entered, folded his arms, letting the door fall to and strike his shoulders, and gazed at that room filled with tables, men, and smoke.
U||A voice broke forth from the mist of smoke, interrupted by another voice. It was Grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary.
U||Grantaire was sitting opposite another figure, at a marble Saint-Anne table, strewn with grains of bran and dotted with dominos. He was hammering the table with his fist, and this is what Enjolras heard:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúDouble-six.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFours.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe pig! I have no more.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are dead. A two.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSix.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThree.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOne.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my move.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFour points.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNot much.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your turn.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have made an enormous mistake.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are doing well.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúFifteen.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSeven more.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat makes me twenty-two.‚Äù [Thoughtfully, ‚ÄúTwenty-two!‚Äù]
U||‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt expecting that double-six. If I had placed it at the beginning, the whole play would have been changed.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA two again.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOne.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOne! Well, five.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt any.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt was your play, I believe?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBlank.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat luck he has! Ah! You are lucky! [Long reverie.] Two.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúOne.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNeither five nor one. That‚Äôs bad for you.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDomino.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPlague take it!‚Äù
U||BOOK SECOND‚Äî√âPONINE
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîTHE LARK‚ÄôS MEADOW
U||Marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose track he had set Javert; but Javert had no sooner quitted the building, bearing off his prisoners in three hackney-coaches, than Marius also glided out of the house. It was only nine o‚Äôclock in the evening. Marius betook himself to Courfeyrac. Courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable inhabitant of the Latin Quarter, he had gone to live in the Rue de la Verrerie ‚Äúfor political reasons‚Äù; this quarter was one where, at that epoch, insurrection liked to install itself. Marius said to Courfeyrac: ‚ÄúI have come to sleep with you.‚Äù Courfeyrac dragged a mattress off his bed, which was furnished with two, spread it out on the floor, and said: ‚ÄúThere.‚Äù
U||At seven o‚Äôclock on the following morning, Marius returned to the hovel, paid the quarter‚Äôs rent which he owed to Ma‚Äôam Bougon, had his books, his bed, his table, his commode, and his two chairs loaded on a hand-cart and went off without leaving his address, so that when Javert returned in the course of the morning, for the purpose of questioning Marius as to the events of the preceding evening, he found only Ma‚Äôam Bougon, who answered: ‚ÄúMoved away!‚Äù
U||Ma‚Äôam Bougon was convinced that Marius was to some extent an accomplice of the robbers who had been seized the night before. ‚ÄúWho would ever have said it?‚Äù she exclaimed to the portresses of the quarter, ‚Äúa young man like that, who had the air of a girl!‚Äù
U||Marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence. The first was, that he now had a horror of that house, where he had beheld, so close at hand, and in its most repulsive and most ferocious development, a social deformity which is, perhaps, even more terrible than the wicked rich man, the wicked poor man. The second was, that he did not wish to figure in the lawsuit which would insue in all probability, and be brought in to testify against Th√©nardier.
U||Javert thought that the young man, whose name he had forgotten, was afraid, and had fled, or perhaps, had not even returned home at the time of the ambush; he made some efforts to find him, however, but without success.
U||A month passed, then another. Marius was still with Courfeyrac. He had learned from a young licentiate in law, an habitual frequenter of the courts, that Th√©nardier was in close confinement. Every Monday, Marius had five francs handed in to the clerk‚Äôs office of La Force for Th√©nardier.
U||As Marius had no longer any money, he borrowed the five francs from Courfeyrac. It was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed money. These periodical five francs were a double riddle to Courfeyrac who lent and to Th√©nardier who received them. ‚ÄúTo whom can they go?‚Äù thought Courfeyrac. ‚ÄúWhence can this come to me?‚Äù Th√©nardier asked himself.
U||Moreover, Marius was heart-broken. Everything had plunged through a trap-door once more. He no longer saw anything before him; his life was again buried in mystery where he wandered fumblingly. He had for a moment beheld very close at hand, in that obscurity, the young girl whom he loved, the old man who seemed to be her father, those unknown beings, who were his only interest and his only hope in this world; and, at the very moment when he thought himself on the point of grasping them, a gust had swept all these shadows away. Not a spark of certainty and truth had been emitted even in the most terrible of collisions. No conjecture was possible. He no longer knew even the name that he thought he knew. It certainly was not Ursule. And the Lark was a nickname. And what was he to think of the old man? Was he actually in hiding from the police? The white-haired workman whom Marius had encountered in the vicinity of the Invalides recurred to his mind. It now seemed probable that that workingman and M. Leblanc wer
U||e one and the same person. So he disguised himself? That man had his heroic and his equivocal sides. Why had he not called for help? Why had he fled? Was he, or was he not, the father of the young girl? Was he, in short, the man whom Th√©nardier thought that he recognized? Th√©nardier might have been mistaken. These formed so many insoluble problems. All this, it is true, detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the Luxembourg. Heart-rending distress; Marius bore a passion in his heart, and night over his eyes. He was thrust onward, he was drawn, and he could not stir. All had vanished, save love. Of love itself he had lost the instincts and the sudden illuminations. Ordinarily, this flame which burns us lights us also a little, and casts some useful gleams without. But Marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of passion. He never said to himself: ‚ÄúWhat if I were to go to such a place? What if I were to try such and such a thing?‚Äù The girl whom he could no longer call Ursule 
U||was evidently somewhere; nothing warned Marius in what direction he should seek her. His whole life was now summed up in two words; absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable fog. To see her once again; he still aspired to this, but he no longer expected it.
U||To crown all, his poverty had returned. He felt that icy breath close to him, on his heels. In the midst of his torments, and long before this, he had discontinued his work, and nothing is more dangerous than discontinued work; it is a habit which vanishes. A habit which is easy to get rid of, and difficult to take up again.
U||A certain amount of dreaming is good, like a narcotic in discreet doses. It lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor, which are sometimes severe, and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which corrects the over-harsh contours of pure thought, fills in gaps here and there, binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas. But too much dreaming sinks and drowns. Woe to the brain-worker who allows himself to fall entirely from thought into reverie! He thinks that he can re-ascend with equal ease, and he tells himself that, after all, it is the same thing. Error!
U||Thought is the toil of the intelligence, reverie its voluptuousness. To replace thought with reverie is to confound a poison with a food.
U||Marius had begun in that way, as the reader will remember. Passion had supervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chim√¶ras without object or bottom. One no longer emerges from one‚Äôs self except for the purpose of going off to dream. Idle production. Tumultuous and stagnant gulf. And, in proportion as labor diminishes, needs increase. This is a law. Man, in a state of reverie, is generally prodigal and slack; the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds.
U||There is, in that mode of life, good mingled with evil, for if enervation is baleful, generosity is good and healthful. But the poor man who is generous and noble, and who does not work, is lost. Resources are exhausted, needs crop up.
U||Fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as well as the most feeble and most vicious are drawn, and which ends in one of two holds, suicide or crime.
U||By dint of going outdoors to think, the day comes when one goes out to throw one‚Äôs self in the water.
U||Excess of reverie breeds men like Escousse and Lebras.
U||Marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace, with his eyes fixed on the girl whom he no longer saw. What we have just written seems strange, and yet it is true. The memory of an absent being kindles in the darkness of the heart; the more it has disappeared, the more it beams; the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon; the star of the inner night. She‚Äîthat was Marius‚Äô whole thought. He meditated of nothing else; he was confusedly conscious that his old coat was becoming an impossible coat, and that his new coat was growing old, that his shirts were wearing out, that his hat was wearing out, that his boots were giving out, and he said to himself: ‚ÄúIf I could but see her once again before I die!‚Äù
U||One sweet idea alone was left to him, that she had loved him, that her glance had told him so, that she did not know his name, but that she did know his soul, and that, wherever she was, however mysterious the place, she still loved him perhaps. Who knows whether she were not thinking of him as he was thinking of her? Sometimes, in those inexplicable hours such as are experienced by every heart that loves, though he had no reasons for anything but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy, he said to himself: ‚ÄúIt is her thoughts that are coming to me!‚Äù Then he added: ‚ÄúPerhaps my thoughts reach her also.‚Äù
U||This illusion, at which he shook his head a moment later, was sufficient, nevertheless, to throw beams, which at times resembled hope, into his soul. From time to time, especially at that evening hour which is the most depressing to even the dreamy, he allowed the purest, the most impersonal, the most ideal of the reveries which filled his brain, to fall upon a notebook which contained nothing else. He called this ‚Äúwriting to her.‚Äù
U||It must not be supposed that his reason was deranged. Quite the contrary. He had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly towards any fixed goal, but he was endowed with more clear-sightedness and rectitude than ever. Marius surveyed by a calm and real, although peculiar light, what passed before his eyes, even the most indifferent deeds and men; he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort of honest dejection and candid disinterestedness. His judgment, which was almost wholly disassociated from hope, held itself aloof and soared on high.
U||In this state of mind nothing escaped him, nothing deceived him, and every moment he was discovering the foundation of life, of humanity, and of destiny. Happy, even in the midst of anguish, is he to whom God has given a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness! He who has not viewed the things of this world and the heart of man under this double light has seen nothing and knows nothing of the true.
U||The soul which loves and suffers is in a state of sublimity.
U||However, day followed day, and nothing new presented itself. It merely seemed to him, that the sombre space which still remained to be traversed by him was growing shorter with every instant. He thought that he already distinctly perceived the brink of the bottomless abyss.
U||‚ÄúWhat!‚Äù he repeated to himself, ‚Äúshall I not see her again before then!‚Äù
U||When you have ascended the Rue Saint-Jacques, left the barrier on one side and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance, you reach the Rue de la Sant√©, then the Glaci√®re, and, a little while before arriving at the little river of the Gobelins, you come to a sort of field which is the only spot in the long and monotonous chain of the boulevards of Paris, where Ruysdael would be tempted to sit down.
U||There is something indescribable there which exhales grace, a green meadow traversed by tightly stretched lines, from which flutter rags drying in the wind, and an old market-gardener‚Äôs house, built in the time of Louis XIII., with its great roof oddly pierced with dormer windows, dilapidated palisades, a little water amid poplar-trees, women, voices, laughter; on the horizon the Panth√©on, the pole of the Deaf-Mutes, the Val-de-Gr√¢ce, black, squat, fantastic, amusing, magnificent, and in the background, the severe square crests of the towers of Notre Dame.
U||As the place is worth looking at, no one goes thither. Hardly one cart or wagoner passes in a quarter of an hour.
U||It chanced that Marius‚Äô solitary strolls led him to this plot of ground, near the water. That day, there was a rarity on the boulevard, a passer-by. Marius, vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of the place, asked this passer-by:‚Äî‚ÄúWhat is the name of this spot?‚Äù
U||The person replied: ‚ÄúIt is the Lark‚Äôs meadow.‚Äù
U||And he added: ‚ÄúIt was here that Ulbach killed the shepherdess of Ivry.‚Äù
U||But after the word ‚ÄúLark‚Äù Marius heard nothing more. These sudden congealments in the state of reverie, which a single word suffices to evoke, do occur. The entire thought is abruptly condensed around an idea, and it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else.
U||The Lark was the appellation which had replaced Ursule in the depths of Marius‚Äô melancholy.‚Äî‚ÄúStop,‚Äù said he with a sort of unreasoning stupor peculiar to these mysterious asides, ‚Äúthis is her meadow. I shall know where she lives now.‚Äù
U||It was absurd, but irresistible.
U||And every day he returned to that meadow of the Lark.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîEMBRYONIC FORMATION OF CRIMES IN THE INCUBATION OF PRISONS
U||Javert‚Äôs triumph in the Gorbeau hovel seemed complete, but had not been so.
U||In the first place, and this constituted the principal anxiety, Javert had not taken the prisoner prisoner. The assassinated man who flees is more suspicious than the assassin, and it is probable that this personage, who had been so precious a capture for the ruffians, would be no less fine a prize for the authorities.
U||And then, Montparnasse had escaped Javert.
U||Another opportunity of laying hands on that ‚Äúdevil‚Äôs dandy‚Äù must be waited for. Montparnasse had, in fact, encountered √âponine as she stood on the watch under the trees of the boulevard, and had led her off, preferring to play Nemorin with the daughter rather than Schinderhannes with the father. It was well that he did so. He was free. As for √âponine, Javert had caused her to be seized; a mediocre consolation. √âponine had joined Azelma at Les Madelonettes.
U||And finally, on the way from the Gorbeau house to La Force, one of the principal prisoners, Claquesous, had been lost. It was not known how this had been effected, the police agents and the sergeants ‚Äúcould not understand it at all.‚Äù He had converted himself into vapor, he had slipped through the handcuffs, he had trickled through the crevices of the carriage, the fiacre was cracked, and he had fled; all that they were able to say was, that on arriving at the prison, there was no Claquesous. Either the fairies or the police had had a hand in it. Had Claquesous melted into the shadows like a snow-flake in water? Had there been unavowed connivance of the police agents? Did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder? Was he concentric with infraction and repression? Had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws in authority? Javert did not accept such comminations, and would have bristled up against such compromises; but his squad included other inspectors besides himself, who wer
U||e more initiated than he, perhaps, although they were his subordinates in the secrets of the Prefecture, and Claquesous had been such a villain that he might make a very good agent. It is an excellent thing for ruffianism and an admirable thing for the police to be on such intimate juggling terms with the night. These double-edged rascals do exist. However that may be, Claquesous had gone astray and was not found again. Javert appeared to be more irritated than amazed at this.
U||As for Marius, ‚Äúthat booby of a lawyer,‚Äù who had probably become frightened, and whose name Javert had forgotten, Javert attached very little importance to him. Moreover, a lawyer can be hunted up at any time. But was he a lawyer after all?
U||The investigation had begun.
U||The magistrate had thought it advisable not to put one of these men of the band of Patron Minette in close confinement, in the hope that he would chatter. This man was Brujon, the long-haired man of the Rue du Petit-Banquier. He had been let loose in the Charlemagne courtyard, and the eyes of the watchers were fixed on him.
U||This name of Brujon is one of the souvenirs of La Force. In that hideous courtyard, called the court of the B√¢timent-Neuf (New Building), which the administration called the court Saint-Bernard, and which the robbers called the Fosse-aux-Lions (The Lion‚Äôs Ditch), on that wall covered with scales and leprosy, which rose on the left to a level with the roofs, near an old door of rusty iron which led to the ancient chapel of the ducal residence of La Force, then turned in a dormitory for ruffians, there could still be seen, twelve years ago, a sort of fortress roughly carved in the stone with a nail, and beneath it this signature:‚Äî
U||BRUJON, 1811.
U||The Brujon of 1811 was the father of the Brujon of 1832.
U||The latter, of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the Gorbeau house, was a very cunning and very adroit young spark, with a bewildered and plaintive air. It was in consequence of this plaintive air that the magistrate had released him, thinking him more useful in the Charlemagne yard than in close confinement.
U||Robbers do not interrupt their profession because they are in the hands of justice. They do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle as that. To be in prison for one crime is no reason for not beginning on another crime. They are artists, who have one picture in the salon, and who toil, nonetheless, on a new work in their studios.
U||Brujon seemed to be stupefied by prison. He could sometimes be seen standing by the hour together in front of the sutler‚Äôs window in the Charlemagne yard, staring like an idiot at the sordid list of prices which began with: garlic, 62 centimes, and ended with: cigar, 5 centimes. Or he passed his time in trembling, chattering his teeth, saying that he had a fever, and inquiring whether one of the eight and twenty beds in the fever ward was vacant.
U||All at once, towards the end of February, 1832, it was discovered that Brujon, that somnolent fellow, had had three different commissions executed by the errand-men of the establishment, not under his own name, but in the name of three of his comrades; and they had cost him in all fifty sous, an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention of the prison corporal.
U||Inquiries were instituted, and on consulting the tariff of commissions posted in the convict‚Äôs parlor, it was learned that the fifty sous could be analyzed as follows: three commissions; one to the Panth√©on, ten sous; one to Val-de-Gr√¢ce, fifteen sous; and one to the Barri√®re de Grenelle, twenty-five sous. This last was the dearest of the whole tariff. Now, at the Panth√©on, at the Val-de-Gr√¢ce, and at the Barri√®re de Grenelle were situated the domiciles of the three very redoubtable prowlers of the barriers, Kruideniers, alias Bizarro, Glorieux, an ex-convict, and Barre-Carosse, upon whom the attention of the police was directed by this incident. It was thought that these men were members of Patron Minette; two of those leaders, Babet and Gueulemer, had been captured. It was supposed that the messages, which had been addressed, not to houses, but to people who were waiting for them in the street, must have contained information with regard to some crime that had been plotted. They were in possession 
U||of other indications; they laid hand on the three prowlers, and supposed that they had circumvented some one or other of Brujon‚Äôs machinations.
U||About a week after these measures had been taken, one night, as the superintendent of the watch, who had been inspecting the lower dormitory in the B√¢timent-Neuf, was about to drop his chestnut in the box‚Äîthis was the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed their duties punctually; every hour a chestnut must be dropped into all the boxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories‚Äîa watchman looked through the peep-hole of the dormitory and beheld Brujon sitting on his bed and writing something by the light of the hall-lamp. The guardian entered, Brujon was put in a solitary cell for a month, but they were not able to seize what he had written. The police learned nothing further about it.
U||What is certain is, that on the following morning, a ‚Äúpostilion‚Äù was flung from the Charlemagne yard into the Lions‚Äô Ditch, over the five-story building which separated the two court-yards.
U||What prisoners call a ‚Äúpostilion‚Äù is a pallet of bread artistically moulded, which is sent into Ireland, that is to say, over the roofs of a prison, from one courtyard to another. Etymology: over England; from one land to another; into Ireland. This little pellet falls in the yard. The man who picks it up opens it and finds in it a note addressed to some prisoner in that yard. If it is a prisoner who finds the treasure, he forwards the note to its destination; if it is a keeper, or one of the prisoners secretly sold who are called sheep in prisons and foxes in the galleys, the note is taken to the office and handed over to the police.
U||On this occasion, the postilion reached its address, although the person to whom it was addressed was, at that moment, in solitary confinement. This person was no other than Babet, one of the four heads of Patron Minette.
U||The postilion contained a roll of paper on which only these two lines were written:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBabet. There is an affair in the Rue Plumet. A gate on a garden.‚Äù
U||This is what Brujon had written the night before.
U||In spite of male and female searchers, Babet managed to pass the note on from La Force to the Salp√™tri√®re, to a ‚Äúgood friend‚Äù whom he had and who was shut up there. This woman in turn transmitted the note to another woman of her acquaintance, a certain Magnon, who was strongly suspected by the police, though not yet arrested. This Magnon, whose name the reader has already seen, had relations with the Th√©nardier, which will be described in detail later on, and she could, by going to see √âponine, serve as a bridge between the Salp√™tri√®re and Les Madelonettes.
U||It happened, that at precisely that moment, as proofs were wanting in the investigation directed against Th√©nardier in the matter of his daughters, √âponine and Azelma were released. When √âponine came out, Magnon, who was watching the gate of the Madelonettes, handed her Brujon‚Äôs note to Babet, charging her to look into the matter.
U||√âponine went to the Rue Plumet, recognized the gate and the garden, observed the house, spied, lurked, and, a few days later, brought to Magnon, who delivers in the Rue Clocheperce, a biscuit, which Magnon transmitted to Babet‚Äôs mistress in the Salp√™tri√®re. A biscuit, in the shady symbolism of prisons, signifies: Nothing to be done.
U||So that in less than a week from that time, as Brujon and Babet met in the circle of La Force, the one on his way to the examination, the other on his way from it:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWell?‚Äù asked Brujon, ‚Äúthe Rue P.?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBiscuit,‚Äù replied Babet. Thus did the f≈ìtus of crime engendered by Brujon in La Force miscarry.
U||This miscarriage had its consequences, however, which were perfectly distinct from Brujon‚Äôs programme. The reader will see what they were.
U||Often when we think we are knotting one thread, we are tying quite another.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîAPPARITION TO FATHER MABEUF
U||Marius no longer went to see any one, but he sometimes encountered Father Mabeuf by chance.
U||While Marius was slowly descending those melancholy steps which may be called the cellar stairs, and which lead to places without light, where the happy can be heard walking overhead, M. Mabeuf was descending on his side.
U||The Flora of Cauteretz no longer sold at all. The experiments on indigo had not been successful in the little garden of Austerlitz, which had a bad exposure. M. Mabeuf could cultivate there only a few plants which love shade and dampness. Nevertheless, he did not become discouraged. He had obtained a corner in the Jardin des Plantes, with a good exposure, to make his trials with indigo ‚Äúat his own expense.‚Äù For this purpose he had pawned his copperplates of the Flora. He had reduced his breakfast to two eggs, and he left one of these for his old servant, to whom he had paid no wages for the last fifteen months. And often his breakfast was his only meal. He no longer smiled with his infantile smile, he had grown morose and no longer received visitors. Marius did well not to dream of going thither. Sometimes, at the hour when M. Mabeuf was on his way to the Jardin des Plantes, the old man and the young man passed each other on the Boulevard de l‚ÄôH√¥pital. They did not speak, and only exchanged a melancho
U||ly sign of the head. A heart-breaking thing it is that there comes a moment when misery looses bonds! Two men who have been friends become two chance passers-by.
U||Royol the bookseller was dead. M. Mabeuf no longer knew his books, his garden, or his indigo: these were the three forms which happiness, pleasure, and hope had assumed for him. This sufficed him for his living. He said to himself: ‚ÄúWhen I shall have made my balls of blueing, I shall be rich, I will withdraw my copperplates from the pawn-shop, I will put my Flora in vogue again with trickery, plenty of money and advertisements in the newspapers and I will buy, I know well where, a copy of Pierre de M√©dine‚Äôs Art de Naviguer, with wood-cuts, edition of 1655.‚Äù In the meantime, he toiled all day over his plot of indigo, and at night he returned home to water his garden, and to read his books. At that epoch, M. Mabeuf was nearly eighty years of age.
U||One evening he had a singular apparition.
U||He had returned home while it was still broad daylight. Mother Plutarque, whose health was declining, was ill and in bed. He had dined on a bone, on which a little meat lingered, and a bit of bread that he had found on the kitchen table, and had seated himself on an overturned stone post, which took the place of a bench in his garden.
U||Near this bench there rose, after the fashion in orchard-gardens, a sort of large chest, of beams and planks, much dilapidated, a rabbit-hutch on the ground floor, a fruit-closet on the first. There was nothing in the hutch, but there were a few apples in the fruit-closet,‚Äîthe remains of the winter‚Äôs provision.
U||M. Mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading, with the aid of his glasses, two books of which he was passionately fond and in which, a serious thing at his age, he was interested. His natural timidity rendered him accessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certain degree. The first of these books was the famous treatise of President Delancre, De l‚ÄôInconstance des D√©mons; the other was a quarto by Mutor de la Rubaudi√®re, Sur les Diables de Vauvert et les Gobelins de la Bi√®vre. This last-mentioned old volume interested him all the more, because his garden had been one of the spots haunted by goblins in former times. The twilight had begun to whiten what was on high and to blacken all below. As he read, over the top of the book which he held in his hand, Father Mabeuf was surveying his plants, and among others a magnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations; four days of heat, wind, and sun without a drop of rain, had passed; the stalks were bending, the buds drooping, the lea
U||ves falling; all this needed water, the rhododendron was particularly sad. Father Mabeuf was one of those persons for whom plants have souls. The old man had toiled all day over his indigo plot, he was worn out with fatigue, but he rose, laid his books on the bench, and walked, all bent over and with tottering footsteps, to the well, but when he had grasped the chain, he could not even draw it sufficiently to unhook it. Then he turned round and cast a glance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded with stars.
U||The evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man beneath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy. The night promised to be as arid as the day had been.
U||‚ÄúStars everywhere!‚Äù thought the old man; ‚Äúnot the tiniest cloud! Not a drop of water!‚Äù
U||And his head, which had been upraised for a moment, fell back upon his breast.
U||He raised it again, and once more looked at the sky, murmuring:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúA tear of dew! A little pity!‚Äù
U||He tried again to unhook the chain of the well, and could not.
U||At that moment, he heard a voice saying:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFather Mabeuf, would you like to have me water your garden for you?‚Äù
U||At the same time, a noise as of a wild animal passing became audible in the hedge, and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall, slender girl, who drew herself up in front of him and stared boldly at him. She had less the air of a human being than of a form which had just blossomed forth from the twilight.
U||Before Father Mabeuf, who was easily terrified, and who was, as we have said, quick to take alarm, was able to reply by a single syllable, this being, whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness, had unhooked the chain, plunged in and withdrawn the bucket, and filled the watering-pot, and the goodman beheld this apparition, which had bare feet and a tattered petticoat, running about among the flower-beds distributing life around her. The sound of the watering-pot on the leaves filled Father Mabeuf‚Äôs soul with ecstasy. It seemed to him that the rhododendron was happy now.
U||The first bucketful emptied, the girl drew a second, then a third. She watered the whole garden.
U||There was something about her, as she thus ran about among paths, where her outline appeared perfectly black, waving her angular arms, and with her fichu all in rags, that resembled a bat.
U||When she had finished, Father Mabeuf approached her with tears in his eyes, and laid his hand on her brow.
U||‚ÄúGod will bless you,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúyou are an angel since you take care of the flowers.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúI am the devil, but that‚Äôs all the same to me.‚Äù
U||The old man exclaimed, without either waiting for or hearing her response:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat a pity that I am so unhappy and so poor, and that I can do nothing for you!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou can do something,‚Äù said she.
U||‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTell me where M. Marius lives.‚Äù
U||The old man did not understand. ‚ÄúWhat Monsieur Marius?‚Äù
U||He raised his glassy eyes and seemed to be seeking something that had vanished.
U||‚ÄúA young man who used to come here.‚Äù
U||In the meantime, M. Mabeuf had searched his memory.
U||‚ÄúAh! yes‚Äî‚Äù he exclaimed. ‚ÄúI know what you mean. Wait! Monsieur Marius‚Äîthe Baron Marius Pontmercy, parbleu! He lives,‚Äîor rather, he no longer lives,‚Äîah well, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù
U||As he spoke, he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron, and he continued:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúHold, I know now. He very often passes along the boulevard, and goes in the direction of the Glaci√®re, Rue Croulebarbe. The meadow of the Lark. Go there. It is not hard to meet him.‚Äù
U||When M. Mabeuf straightened himself up, there was no longer any one there; the girl had disappeared.
U||He was decidedly terrified.
U||‚ÄúReally,‚Äù he thought, ‚Äúif my garden had not been watered, I should think that she was a spirit.‚Äù
U||An hour later, when he was in bed, it came back to him, and as he fell asleep, at that confused moment when thought, like that fabulous bird which changes itself into a fish in order to cross the sea, little by little assumes the form of a dream in order to traverse slumber, he said to himself in a bewildered way:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúIn sooth, that greatly resembles what Rubaudi√®re narrates of the goblins. Could it have been a goblin?‚Äù
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîAN APPARITION TO MARIUS
U||Some days after this visit of a ‚Äúspirit‚Äù to Farmer Mabeuf, one morning,‚Äîit was on a Monday, the day when Marius borrowed the hundred-sou piece from Courfeyrac for Th√©nardier‚ÄîMarius had put this coin in his pocket, and before carrying it to the clerk‚Äôs office, he had gone ‚Äúto take a little stroll,‚Äù in the hope that this would make him work on his return. It was always thus, however. As soon as he rose, he seated himself before a book and a sheet of paper in order to scribble some translation; his task at that epoch consisted in turning into French a celebrated quarrel between Germans, the Gans and Savigny controversy; he took Savigny, he took Gans, read four lines, tried to write one, could not, saw a star between him and his paper, and rose from his chair, saying: ‚ÄúI shall go out. That will put me in spirits.‚Äù
U||And off he went to the Lark‚Äôs meadow.
U||There he beheld more than ever the star, and less than ever Savigny and Gans.
U||He returned home, tried to take up his work again, and did not succeed; there was no means of re-knotting a single one of the threads which were broken in his brain; then he said to himself: ‚ÄúI will not go out to-morrow. It prevents my working.‚Äù And he went out every day.
U||He lived in the Lark‚Äôs meadow more than in Courfeyrac‚Äôs lodgings. That was his real address: Boulevard de la Sant√©, at the seventh tree from the Rue Croulebarbe.
U||That morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on the parapet of the River des Gobelins. A cheerful sunlight penetrated the freshly unfolded and luminous leaves.
U||He was dreaming of ‚ÄúHer.‚Äù And his meditation turning to a reproach, fell back upon himself; he reflected dolefully on his idleness, his paralysis of soul, which was gaining on him, and of that night which was growing more dense every moment before him, to such a point that he no longer even saw the sun.
U||Nevertheless, athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas which was not even a monologue, so feeble had action become in him, and he had no longer the force to care to despair, athwart this melancholy absorption, sensations from without did reach him. He heard behind him, beneath him, on both banks of the river, the laundresses of the Gobelins beating their linen, and above his head, the birds chattering and singing in the elm-trees. On the one hand, the sound of liberty, the careless happiness of the leisure which has wings; on the other, the sound of toil. What caused him to meditate deeply, and almost reflect, were two cheerful sounds.
U||All at once, in the midst of his dejected ecstasy, he heard a familiar voice saying:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúCome! Here he is!‚Äù
U||He raised his eyes, and recognized that wretched child who had come to him one morning, the elder of the Th√©nardier daughters, √âponine; he knew her name now. Strange to say, she had grown poorer and prettier, two steps which it had not seemed within her power to take. She had accomplished a double progress, towards the light and towards distress. She was barefooted and in rags, as on the day when she had so resolutely entered his chamber, only her rags were two months older now, the holes were larger, the tatters more sordid. It was the same harsh voice, the same brow dimmed and wrinkled with tan, the same free, wild, and vacillating glance. She had besides, more than formerly, in her face that indescribably terrified and lamentable something which sojourn in a prison adds to wretchedness.
U||She had bits of straw and hay in her hair, not like Ophelia through having gone mad from the contagion of Hamlet‚Äôs madness, but because she had slept in the loft of some stable.
U||And in spite of it all, she was beautiful. What a star art thou, O youth!
U||In the meantime, she had halted in front of Marius with a trace of joy in her livid countenance, and something which resembled a smile.
U||She stood for several moments as though incapable of speech.
U||‚ÄúSo I have met you at last!‚Äù she said at length. ‚ÄúFather Mabeuf was right, it was on this boulevard! How I have hunted for you! If you only knew! Do you know? I have been in the jug. A fortnight! They let me out! seeing that there was nothing against me, and that, moreover, I had not reached years of discretion. I lack two months of it. Oh! how I have hunted for you! These six weeks! So you don‚Äôt live down there any more?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Marius.
U||‚ÄúAh! I understand. Because of that affair. Those take-downs are disagreeable. You cleared out. Come now! Why do you wear old hats like this! A young man like you ought to have fine clothes. Do you know, Monsieur Marius, Father Mabeuf calls you Baron Marius, I don‚Äôt know what. It isn‚Äôt true that you are a baron? Barons are old fellows, they go to the Luxembourg, in front of the ch√¢teau, where there is the most sun, and they read the Quotidienne for a sou. I once carried a letter to a baron of that sort. He was over a hundred years old. Say, where do you live now?‚Äù
U||Marius made no reply.
U||‚ÄúAh!‚Äù she went on, ‚Äúyou have a hole in your shirt. I must sew it up for you.‚Äù
U||She resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem glad to see me.‚Äù
U||Marius held his peace; she remained silent for a moment, then exclaimed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBut if I choose, nevertheless, I could force you to look glad!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù demanded Marius. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAh! you used to call me thou,‚Äù she retorted.
U||‚ÄúWell, then, what dost thou mean?‚Äù
U||She bit her lips; she seemed to hesitate, as though a prey to some sort of inward conflict. At last she appeared to come to a decision.
U||‚ÄúSo much the worse, I don‚Äôt care. You have a melancholy air, I want you to be pleased. Only promise me that you will smile. I want to see you smile and hear you say: ‚ÄòAh, well, that‚Äôs good.‚Äô Poor Mr. Marius! you know? You promised me that you would give me anything I like‚Äî‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes! Only speak!‚Äù
U||She looked Marius full in the eye, and said:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúI have the address.‚Äù
U||Marius turned pale. All the blood flowed back to his heart.
U||‚ÄúWhat address?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe address that you asked me to get!‚Äù
U||She added, as though with an effort:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe address‚Äîyou know very well!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYes!‚Äù stammered Marius.
U||‚ÄúOf that young lady.‚Äù
U||This word uttered, she sighed deeply.
U||Marius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized her hand distractedly.
U||‚ÄúOh! Well! lead me thither! Tell me! Ask of me anything you wish! Where is it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCome with me,‚Äù she responded. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the street or number very well; it is in quite the other direction from here, but I know the house well, I will take you to it.‚Äù
U||She withdrew her hand and went on, in a tone which could have rent the heart of an observer, but which did not even graze Marius in his intoxicated and ecstatic state:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúOh! how glad you are!‚Äù
U||A cloud swept across Marius‚Äô brow. He seized √âponine by the arm:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúSwear one thing to me!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSwear!‚Äù said she, ‚Äúwhat does that mean? Come! You want me to swear?‚Äù
U||And she laughed.
U||‚ÄúYour father! promise me, √âponine! Swear to me that you will not give this address to your father!‚Äù
U||She turned to him with a stupefied air.
U||‚Äú√âponine! How do you know that my name is √âponine?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúPromise what I tell you!‚Äù
U||But she did not seem to hear him.
U||‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice! You have called me √âponine!‚Äù
U||Marius grasped both her arms at once.
U||‚ÄúBut answer me, in the name of Heaven! pay attention to what I am saying to you, swear to me that you will not tell your father this address that you know!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMy father!‚Äù said she. ‚ÄúAh yes, my father! Be at ease. He‚Äôs in close confinement. Besides, what do I care for my father!‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut you do not promise me!‚Äù exclaimed Marius.
U||‚ÄúLet go of me!‚Äù she said, bursting into a laugh, ‚Äúhow you do shake me! Yes! Yes! I promise that! I swear that to you! What is that to me? I will not tell my father the address. There! Is that right? Is that it?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNor to any one?‚Äù said Marius.
U||‚ÄúNor to any one.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNow,‚Äù resumed Marius, ‚Äútake me there.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúImmediately?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúImmediately.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCome along. Ah! how pleased he is!‚Äù said she.
U||After a few steps she halted.
U||‚ÄúYou are following me too closely, Monsieur Marius. Let me go on ahead, and follow me so, without seeming to do it. A nice young man like you must not be seen with a woman like me.‚Äù
U||No tongue can express all that lay in that word, woman, thus pronounced by that child.
U||She proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more; Marius joined her. She addressed him sideways, and without turning towards him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúBy the way, you know that you promised me something?‚Äù
U||Marius fumbled in his pocket. All that he owned in the world was the five francs intended for Th√©nardier the father. He took them and laid them in √âponine‚Äôs hand.
U||She opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground, and gazed at him with a gloomy air.
U||‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want your money,‚Äù said she.
U||BOOK THIRD‚ÄîTHE HOUSE IN THE RUE PLUMET
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîTHE HOUSE WITH A SECRET
U||About the middle of the last century, a chief justice in the Parliament of Paris having a mistress and concealing the fact, for at that period the grand seignors displayed their mistresses, and the bourgeois concealed them, had ‚Äúa little house‚Äù built in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the deserted Rue Blomet, which is now called Rue Plumet, not far from the spot which was then designated as Combat des Animaux.
U||This house was composed of a single-storied pavilion; two rooms on the ground floor, two chambers on the first floor, a kitchen downstairs, a boudoir upstairs, an attic under the roof, the whole preceded by a garden with a large gate opening on the street. This garden was about an acre and a half in extent. This was all that could be seen by passers-by; but behind the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard, and at the end of the courtyard a low building consisting of two rooms and a cellar, a sort of preparation destined to conceal a child and nurse in case of need. This building communicated in the rear by a masked door which opened by a secret spring, with a long, narrow, paved winding corridor, open to the sky, hemmed in with two lofty walls, which, hidden with wonderful art, and lost as it were between garden enclosures and cultivated land, all of whose angles and detours it followed, ended in another door, also with a secret lock which opened a quarter of a league away, almost in another quarter, at the 
U||solitary extremity of the Rue du Babylone.
U||Through this the chief justice entered, so that even those who were spying on him and following him would merely have observed that the justice betook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere, and would never have suspected that to go to the Rue de Babylone was to go to the Rue Blomet. Thanks to clever purchasers of land, the magistrate had been able to make a secret, sewer-like passage on his own property, and consequently, without interference. Later on, he had sold in little parcels, for gardens and market gardens, the lots of ground adjoining the corridor, and the proprietors of these lots on both sides thought they had a party wall before their eyes, and did not even suspect the long, paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their flower-beds and their orchards. Only the birds beheld this curiosity. It is probable that the linnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal about the chief justice.
U||The pavilion, built of stone in the taste of Mansard, wainscoted and furnished in the Watteau style, rocaille on the inside, old-fashioned on the outside, walled in with a triple hedge of flowers, had something discreet, coquettish, and solemn about it, as befits a caprice of love and magistracy.
U||This house and corridor, which have now disappeared, were in existence fifteen years ago. In ‚Äô93 a coppersmith had purchased the house with the idea of demolishing it, but had not been able to pay the price; the nation made him bankrupt. So that it was the house which demolished the coppersmith. After that, the house remained uninhabited, and fell slowly to ruin, as does every dwelling to which the presence of man does not communicate life. It had remained fitted with its old furniture, was always for sale or to let, and the ten or a dozen people who passed through the Rue Plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow and illegible bit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since 1819.
U||Towards the end of the Restoration, these same passers-by might have noticed that the bill had disappeared, and even that the shutters on the first floor were open. The house was occupied, in fact. The windows had short curtains, a sign that there was a woman about.
U||In the month of October, 1829, a man of a certain age had presented himself and had hired the house just as it stood, including, of course, the back building and the lane which ended in the Rue de Babylone. He had had the secret openings of the two doors to this passage repaired. The house, as we have just mentioned, was still very nearly furnished with the justice‚Äôs old fitting; the new tenant had ordered some repairs, had added what was lacking here and there, had replaced the paving-stones in the yard, bricks in the floors, steps in the stairs, missing bits in the inlaid floors and the glass in the lattice windows, and had finally installed himself there with a young girl and an elderly maid-servant, without commotion, rather like a person who is slipping in than like a man who is entering his own house. The neighbors did not gossip about him, for the reason that there were no neighbors.
U||This unobtrusive tenant was Jean Valjean, the young girl was Cosette. The servant was a woman named Toussaint, whom Jean Valjean had saved from the hospital and from wretchedness, and who was elderly, a stammerer, and from the provinces, three qualities which had decided Jean Valjean to take her with him. He had hired the house under the name of M. Fauchelevent, independent gentleman. In all that has been related heretofore, the reader has, doubtless, been no less prompt than Th√©nardier to recognize Jean Valjean.
U||Why had Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the Petit-Picpus? What had happened?
U||Nothing had happened.
U||It will be remembered that Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, so happy that his conscience finally took the alarm. He saw Cosette every day, he felt paternity spring up and develop within him more and more, he brooded over the soul of that child, he said to himself that she was his, that nothing could take her from him, that this would last indefinitely, that she would certainly become a nun, being thereto gently incited every day, that thus the convent was henceforth the universe for her as it was for him, that he should grow old there, and that she would grow up there, that she would grow old there, and that he should die there; that, in short, delightful hope, no separation was possible. On reflecting upon this, he fell into perplexity. He interrogated himself. He asked himself if all that happiness were really his, if it were not composed of the happiness of another, of the happiness of that child which he, an old man, was confiscating and stealing; if that were not theft? He said to himself, that th
U||is child had a right to know life before renouncing it, that to deprive her in advance, and in some sort without consulting her, of all joys, under the pretext of saving her from all trials, to take advantage of her ignorance of her isolation, in order to make an artificial vocation germinate in her, was to rob a human creature of its nature and to lie to God. And who knows if, when she came to be aware of all this some day, and found herself a nun to her sorrow, Cosette would not come to hate him? A last, almost selfish thought, and less heroic than the rest, but which was intolerable to him. He resolved to quit the convent.
U||He resolved on this; he recognized with anguish, the fact that it was necessary. As for objections, there were none. Five years‚Äô sojourn between these four walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyed or dispersed the elements of fear. He could return tranquilly among men. He had grown old, and all had undergone a change. Who would recognize him now? And then, to face the worst, there was danger only for himself, and he had no right to condemn Cosette to the cloister for the reason that he had been condemned to the galleys. Besides, what is danger in comparison with the right? Finally, nothing prevented his being prudent and taking his precautions.
U||As for Cosette‚Äôs education, it was almost finished and complete.
U||His determination once taken, he awaited an opportunity. It was not long in presenting itself. Old Fauchelevent died.
U||Jean Valjean demanded an audience with the revered prioress and told her that, having come into a little inheritance at the death of his brother, which permitted him henceforth to live without working, he should leave the service of the convent and take his daughter with him; but that, as it was not just that Cosette, since she had not taken the vows, should have received her education gratuitously, he humbly begged the Reverend Prioress to see fit that he should offer to the community, as indemnity, for the five years which Cosette had spent there, the sum of five thousand francs.
U||It was thus that Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the Perpetual Adoration.
U||On leaving the convent, he took in his own arms the little valise the key to which he still wore on his person, and would permit no porter to touch it. This puzzled Cosette, because of the odor of embalming which proceeded from it.
U||Let us state at once, that this trunk never quitted him more. He always had it in his chamber. It was the first and only thing sometimes, that he carried off in his moving when he moved about. Cosette laughed at it, and called this valise his inseparable, saying: ‚ÄúI am jealous of it.‚Äù
U||Nevertheless, Jean Valjean did not reappear in the open air without profound anxiety.
U||He discovered the house in the Rue Plumet, and hid himself from sight there. Henceforth he was in the possession of the name:‚ÄîUltime Fauchelevent.
U||At the same time he hired two other apartments in Paris, in order that he might attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the same quarter, and so that he could, at need, take himself off at the slightest disquietude which should assail him, and in short, so that he might not again be caught unprovided as on the night when he had so miraculously escaped from Javert. These two apartments were very pitiable, poor in appearance, and in two quarters which were far remote from each other, the one in the Rue de l‚ÄôOuest, the other in the Rue de l‚ÄôHomme Arm√©.
U||He went from time to time, now to the Rue de l‚ÄôHomme Arm√©, now to the Rue de l‚ÄôOuest, to pass a month or six weeks, without taking Toussaint. He had himself served by the porters, and gave himself out as a gentleman from the suburbs, living on his funds, and having a little temporary resting-place in town. This lofty virtue had three domiciles in Paris for the sake of escaping from the police.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîJEAN VALJEAN AS A NATIONAL GUARD
U||However, properly speaking, he lived in the Rue Plumet, and he had arranged his existence there in the following fashion:‚Äî
U||Cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion; she had the big sleeping-room with the painted pier-glasses, the boudoir with the gilded fillets, the justice‚Äôs drawing-room furnished with tapestries and vast armchairs; she had the garden. Jean Valjean had a canopied bed of antique damask in three colors and a beautiful Persian rug purchased in the Rue du Figuier-Saint-Paul at Mother Gaucher‚Äôs, put into Cosette‚Äôs chamber, and, in order to redeem the severity of these magnificent old things, he had amalgamated with this bric-√†-brac all the gay and graceful little pieces of furniture suitable to young girls, an √©tag√®re, a bookcase filled with gilt-edged books, an inkstand, a blotting-book, paper, a work-table incrusted with mother of pearl, a silver-gilt dressing-case, a toilet service in Japanese porcelain. Long damask curtains with a red foundation and three colors, like those on the bed, hung at the windows of the first floor. On the ground floor, the curtains were of tapestry. All winter long, Coset
U||te‚Äôs little house was heated from top to bottom. Jean Valjean inhabited the sort of porter‚Äôs lodge which was situated at the end of the back courtyard, with a mattress on a folding-bed, a white wood table, two straw chairs, an earthenware water-jug, a few old volumes on a shelf, his beloved valise in one corner, and never any fire. He dined with Cosette, and he had a loaf of black bread on the table for his own use.
U||When Toussaint came, he had said to her: ‚ÄúIt is the young lady who is the mistress of this house.‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúAnd you, monsieur?‚Äù Toussaint replied in amazement.‚Äî‚ÄúI am a much better thing than the master, I am the father.‚Äù
U||Cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent, and she regulated their expenditure, which was very modest. Every day, Jean Valjean put his arm through Cosette‚Äôs and took her for a walk. He led her to the Luxembourg, to the least frequented walk, and every Sunday he took her to mass at Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, because that was a long way off. As it was a very poor quarter, he bestowed alms largely there, and the poor people surrounded him in church, which had drawn down upon him Th√©nardier‚Äôs epistle: ‚ÄúTo the benevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.‚Äù He was fond of taking Cosette to visit the poor and the sick. No stranger ever entered the house in the Rue Plumet. Toussaint brought their provisions, and Jean Valjean went himself for water to a fountain nearby on the boulevard. Their wood and wine were put into a half-subterranean hollow lined with rock-work which lay near the Rue de Babylone and which had formerly served the chief-justice as a grotto; for at the epoch o
U||f follies and ‚ÄúLittle Houses‚Äù no love was without a grotto.
U||In the door opening on the Rue de Babylone, there was a box destined for the reception of letters and papers; only, as the three inhabitants of the pavilion in the Rue Plumet received neither papers nor letters, the entire usefulness of that box, formerly the go-between of a love affair, and the confidant of a love-lorn lawyer, was now limited to the tax-collector‚Äôs notices, and the summons of the guard. For M. Fauchelevent, independent gentleman, belonged to the national guard; he had not been able to escape through the fine meshes of the census of 1831. The municipal information collected at that time had even reached the convent of the Petit-Picpus, a sort of impenetrable and holy cloud, whence Jean Valjean had emerged in venerable guise, and, consequently, worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the town-hall.
U||Three or four times a year, Jean Valjean donned his uniform and mounted guard; he did this willingly, however; it was a correct disguise which mixed him with every one, and yet left him solitary. Jean Valjean had just attained his sixtieth birthday, the age of legal exemption; but he did not appear to be over fifty; moreover, he had no desire to escape his sergeant-major nor to quibble with Comte de Lobau; he possessed no civil status, he was concealing his name, he was concealing his identity, so he concealed his age, he concealed everything; and, as we have just said, he willingly did his duty as a national guard; the sum of his ambition lay in resembling any other man who paid his taxes. This man had for his ideal, within, the angel, without, the bourgeois.
U||Let us note one detail, however; when Jean Valjean went out with Cosette, he dressed as the reader has already seen, and had the air of a retired officer. When he went out alone, which was generally at night, he was always dressed in a workingman‚Äôs trousers and blouse, and wore a cap which concealed his face. Was this precaution or humility? Both. Cosette was accustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny, and hardly noticed her father‚Äôs peculiarities. As for Toussaint, she venerated Jean Valjean, and thought everything he did right.
U||One day, her butcher, who had caught a glimpse of Jean Valjean, said to her: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a queer fish.‚Äù She replied: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a saint.‚Äù
U||Neither Jean Valjean nor Cosette nor Toussaint ever entered or emerged except by the door on the Rue de Babylone. Unless seen through the garden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in the Rue Plumet. That gate was always closed. Jean Valjean had left the garden uncultivated, in order not to attract attention.
U||In this, possibly, he made a mistake.
U||CHAPTER III‚ÄîFOLIIS AC FRONDIBUS
U||The garden thus left to itself for more than half a century had become extraordinary and charming. The passers-by of forty years ago halted to gaze at it, without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh and verdant depths. More than one dreamer of that epoch often allowed his thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of that ancient, padlocked gate, twisted, tottering, fastened to two green and moss-covered pillars, and oddly crowned with a pediment of undecipherable arabesque.
U||There was a stone bench in one corner, one or two mouldy statues, several lattices which had lost their nails with time, were rotting on the wall, and there were no walks nor turf; but there was enough grass everywhere. Gardening had taken its departure, and nature had returned. Weeds abounded, which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of land. The festival of gilliflowers was something splendid. Nothing in this garden obstructed the sacred effort of things towards life; venerable growth reigned there among them. The trees had bent over towards the nettles, the plant had sprung upward, the branch had inclined, that which crawls on the earth had gone in search of that which expands in the air, that which floats on the wind had bent over towards that which trails in the moss; trunks, boughs, leaves, fibres, clusters, tendrils, shoots, spines, thorns, had mingled, crossed, married, confounded themselves in each other; vegetation in a deep and close embrace, had celebrated and accomplished there, under t
U||he well-pleased eye of the Creator, in that enclosure three hundred feet square, the holy mystery of fraternity, symbol of the human fraternity. This garden was no longer a garden, it was a colossal thicket, that is to say, something as impenetrable as a forest, as peopled as a city, quivering like a nest, sombre like a cathedral, fragrant like a bouquet, solitary as a tomb, living as a throng.
U||In Flor√©al34 this enormous thicket, free behind its gate and within its four walls, entered upon the secret labor of germination, quivered in the rising sun, almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of cosmic love, and which feels the sap of April rising and boiling in its veins, and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks, sprinkled on the damp earth, on the defaced statues, on the crumbling steps of the pavilion, and even on the pavement of the deserted street, flowers like stars, dew like pearls, fecundity, beauty, life, joy, perfumes. At midday, a thousand white butterflies took refuge there, and it was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about there in flakes amid the shade. There, in those gay shadows of verdure, a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul, and what the twittering forgot to say the humming completed. In the evening, a dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it; a shroud of mist, a calm and celestial sadness covered it;
U|| the intoxicating perfume of the honeysuckles and convolvulus poured out from every part of it, like an exquisite and subtle poison; the last appeals of the woodpeckers and the wagtails were audible as they dozed among the branches; one felt the sacred intimacy of the birds and the trees; by day the wings rejoice the leaves, by night the leaves protect the wings.
U||In winter the thicket was black, dripping, bristling, shivering, and allowed some glimpse of the house. Instead of flowers on the branches and dew in the flowers, the long silvery tracks of the snails were visible on the cold, thick carpet of yellow leaves; but in any fashion, under any aspect, at all seasons, spring, winter, summer, autumn, this tiny enclosure breathed forth melancholy, contemplation, solitude, liberty, the absence of man, the presence of God; and the rusty old gate had the air of saying: ‚ÄúThis garden belongs to me.‚Äù
U||It was of no avail that the pavements of Paris were there on every side, the classic and splendid hotels of the Rue de Varennes a couple of paces away, the dome of the Invalides close at hand, the Chamber of Deputies not far off; the carriages of the Rue de Bourgogne and of the Rue Saint-Dominique rumbled luxuriously, in vain, in the vicinity, in vain did the yellow, brown, white, and red omnibuses cross each other‚Äôs course at the neighboring crossroads; the Rue Plumet was the desert; and the death of the former proprietors, the revolution which had passed over it, the crumbling away of ancient fortunes, absence, forgetfulness, forty years of abandonment and widowhood, had sufficed to restore to this privileged spot ferns, mulleins, hemlock, yarrow, tall weeds, great crimped plants, with large leaves of pale green cloth, lizards, beetles, uneasy and rapid insects; to cause to spring forth from the depths of the earth and to reappear between those four walls a certain indescribable and savage grandeur; and 
U||for nature, which disconcerts the petty arrangements of man, and which sheds herself always thoroughly where she diffuses herself at all, in the ant as well as in the eagle, to blossom out in a petty little Parisian garden with as much rude force and majesty as in a virgin forest of the New World.
U||Nothing is small, in fact; any one who is subject to the profound and penetrating influence of nature knows this. Although no absolute satisfaction is given to philosophy, either to circumscribe the cause or to limit the effect, the contemplator falls into those unfathomable ecstasies caused by these decompositions of force terminating in unity. Everything toils at everything.
U||Algebra is applied to the clouds; the radiation of the star profits the rose; no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations. Who, then, can calculate the course of a molecule? How do we know that the creation of worlds is not determined by the fall of grains of sand? Who knows the reciprocal ebb and flow of the infinitely great and the infinitely little, the reverberations of causes in the precipices of being, and the avalanches of creation? The tiniest worm is of importance; the great is little, the little is great; everything is balanced in necessity; alarming vision for the mind. There are marvellous relations between beings and things; in that inexhaustible whole, from the sun to the grub, nothing despises the other; all have need of each other. The light does not bear away terrestrial perfumes into the azure depths, without knowing what it is doing; the night distributes stellar essences to the sleeping flowers. All birds that fly have round their l
U||eg the thread of the infinite. Germination is complicated with the bursting forth of a meteor and with the peck of a swallow cracking its egg, and it places on one level the birth of an earthworm and the advent of Socrates. Where the telescope ends, the microscope begins. Which of the two possesses the larger field of vision? Choose. A bit of mould is a pleiad of flowers; a nebula is an ant-hill of stars. The same promiscuousness, and yet more unprecedented, exists between the things of the intelligence and the facts of substance. Elements and principles mingle, combine, wed, multiply with each other, to such a point that the material and the moral world are brought eventually to the same clearness. The phenomenon is perpetually returning upon itself. In the vast cosmic exchanges the universal life goes and comes in unknown quantities, rolling entirely in the invisible mystery of effluvia, employing everything, not losing a single dream, not a single slumber, sowing an animalcule here, crumbling to bits a pl
U||anet there, oscillating and winding, making of light a force and of thought an element, disseminated and invisible, dissolving all, except that geometrical point, the I; bringing everything back to the soul-atom; expanding everything in God, entangling all activity, from summit to base, in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism, attaching the flight of an insect to the movement of the earth, subordinating, who knows? Were it only by the identity of the law, the evolution of the comet in the firmament to the whirling of the infusoria in the drop of water. A machine made of mind. Enormous gearing, the prime motor of which is the gnat, and whose final wheel is the zodiac.
U||CHAPTER IV‚ÄîCHANGE OF GATE
U||It seemed that this garden, created in olden days to conceal wanton mysteries, had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste mysteries. There were no longer either arbors, or bowling greens, or tunnels, or grottos; there was a magnificent, dishevelled obscurity falling like a veil over all. Paphos had been made over into Eden. It is impossible to say what element of repentance had rendered this retreat wholesome. This flower-girl now offered her blossom to the soul. This coquettish garden, formerly decidedly compromised, had returned to virginity and modesty. A justice assisted by a gardener, a goodman who thought that he was a continuation of Lamoignon, and another goodman who thought that he was a continuation of Len√¥tre, had turned it about, cut, ruffled, decked, moulded it to gallantry; nature had taken possession of it once more, had filled it with shade, and had arranged it for love.
U||There was, also, in this solitude, a heart which was quite ready. Love had only to show himself; he had here a temple composed of verdure, grass, moss, the sight of birds, tender shadows, agitated branches, and a soul made of sweetness, of faith, of candor, of hope, of aspiration, and of illusion.
U||Cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child; she was a little more than fourteen, and she was at the ‚Äúungrateful age‚Äù; we have already said, that with the exception of her eyes, she was homely rather than pretty; she had no ungraceful feature, but she was awkward, thin, timid and bold at once, a grown-up little girl, in short.
U||Her education was finished, that is to say, she has been taught religion, and even and above all, devotion; then ‚Äúhistory,‚Äù that is to say the thing that bears that name in convents, geography, grammar, the participles, the kings of France, a little music, a little drawing, etc.; but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant, which is a great charm and a great peril. The soul of a young girl should not be left in the dark; later on, mirages that are too abrupt and too lively are formed there, as in a dark chamber. She should be gently and discreetly enlightened, rather with the reflection of realities than with their harsh and direct light. A useful and graciously austere half-light which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls. There is nothing but the maternal instinct, that admirable intuition composed of the memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman, which knows how this half-light is to be created and of what it should consist.
U||Nothing supplies the place of this instinct. All the nuns in the world are not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girl‚Äôs soul.
U||Cosette had had no mother. She had only had many mothers, in the plural.
U||As for Jean Valjean, he was, indeed, all tenderness, all solicitude; but he was only an old man and he knew nothing at all.
U||Now, in this work of education, in this grave matter of preparing a woman for life, what science is required to combat that vast ignorance which is called innocence!
U||Nothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent. The convent turns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown. The heart, thus thrown back upon itself, works downward within itself, since it cannot overflow, and grows deep, since it cannot expand. Hence visions, suppositions, conjectures, outlines of romances, a desire for adventures, fantastic constructions, edifices built wholly in the inner obscurity of the mind, sombre and secret abodes where the passions immediately find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permits them to enter. The convent is a compression which, in order to triumph over the human heart, should last during the whole life.
U||On quitting the convent, Cosette could have found nothing more sweet and more dangerous than the house in the Rue Plumet. It was the continuation of solitude with the beginning of liberty; a garden that was closed, but a nature that was acrid, rich, voluptuous, and fragrant; the same dreams as in the convent, but with glimpses of young men; a grating, but one that opened on the street.
U||Still, when she arrived there, we repeat, she was only a child. Jean Valjean gave this neglected garden over to her. ‚ÄúDo what you like with it,‚Äù he said to her. This amused Cosette; she turned over all the clumps and all the stones, she hunted for ‚Äúbeasts‚Äù; she played in it, while awaiting the time when she would dream in it; she loved this garden for the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass, while awaiting the day when she would love it for the stars that she would see through the boughs above her head.
U||And then, she loved her father, that is to say, Jean Valjean, with all her soul, with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman a beloved and charming companion to her. It will be remembered that M. Madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal. Jean Valjean had continued this practice; he had come to converse well; he possessed the secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has spontaneously cultivated itself. He retained just enough sharpness to season his kindness; his mind was rough and his heart was soft. During their conversations in the Luxembourg, he gave her explanations of everything, drawing on what he had read, and also on what he had suffered. As she listened to him, Cosette‚Äôs eyes wandered vaguely about.
U||This simple man sufficed for Cosette‚Äôs thought, the same as the wild garden sufficed for her eyes. When she had had a good chase after the butterflies, she came panting up to him and said: ‚ÄúAh! How I have run!‚Äù He kissed her brow.
U||Cosette adored the goodman. She was always at his heels. Where Jean Valjean was, there happiness was. Jean Valjean lived neither in the pavilion nor the garden; she took greater pleasure in the paved back courtyard, than in the enclosure filled with flowers, and in his little lodge furnished with straw-seated chairs than in the great drawing-room hung with tapestry, against which stood tufted easy-chairs. Jean Valjean sometimes said to her, smiling at his happiness in being importuned: ‚ÄúDo go to your own quarters! Leave me alone a little!‚Äù
U||She gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so graceful when they come from a daughter to her father.
U||‚ÄúFather, I am very cold in your rooms; why don‚Äôt you have a carpet here and a stove?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúDear child, there are so many people who are better than I and who have not even a roof over their heads.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThen why is there a fire in my rooms, and everything that is needed?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBecause you are a woman and a child.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBah! must men be cold and feel uncomfortable?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúCertain men.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is good, I shall come here so often that you will be obliged to have a fire.‚Äù
U||And again she said to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFather, why do you eat horrible bread like that?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBecause, my daughter.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWell, if you eat it, I will eat it too.‚Äù
U||Then, in order to prevent Cosette eating black bread, Jean Valjean ate white bread.
U||Cosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood. She prayed morning and evening for her mother whom she had never known. The Th√©nardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream. She remembered that she had gone ‚Äúone day, at night,‚Äù to fetch water in a forest. She thought that it had been very far from Paris. It seemed to her that she had begun to live in an abyss, and that it was Jean Valjean who had rescued her from it. Her childhood produced upon her the effect of a time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds, spiders, and serpents. When she meditated in the evening, before falling asleep, as she had not a very clear idea that she was Jean Valjean‚Äôs daughter, and that he was her father, she fancied that the soul of her mother had passed into that good man and had come to dwell near her.
U||When he was seated, she leaned her cheek against his white hair, and dropped a silent tear, saying to herself: ‚ÄúPerhaps this man is my mother.‚Äù
U||Cosette, although this is a strange statement to make, in the profound ignorance of a girl brought up in a convent,‚Äîmaternity being also absolutely unintelligible to virginity,‚Äîhad ended by fancying that she had had as little mother as possible. She did not even know her mother‚Äôs name. Whenever she asked Jean Valjean, Jean Valjean remained silent. If she repeated her question, he responded with a smile. Once she insisted; the smile ended in a tear.
U||This silence on the part of Jean Valjean covered Fantine with darkness.
U||Was it prudence? Was it respect? Was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own?
U||So long as Cosette had been small, Jean Valjean had been willing to talk to her of her mother; when she became a young girl, it was impossible for him to do so. It seemed to him that he no longer dared. Was it because of Cosette? Was it because of Fantine? He felt a certain religious horror at letting that shadow enter Cosette‚Äôs thought; and of placing a third in their destiny. The more sacred this shade was to him, the more did it seem that it was to be feared. He thought of Fantine, and felt himself overwhelmed with silence.
U||Through the darkness, he vaguely perceived something which appeared to have its finger on its lips. Had all the modesty which had been in Fantine, and which had violently quitted her during her lifetime, returned to rest upon her after her death, to watch in indignation over the peace of that dead woman, and in its shyness, to keep her in her grave? Was Jean Valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure? We who believe in death, are not among the number who will reject this mysterious explanation.
U||Hence the impossibility of uttering, even for Cosette, that name of Fantine.
U||One day Cosette said to him:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFather, I saw my mother in a dream last night. She had two big wings. My mother must have been almost a saint during her life.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThrough martyrdom,‚Äù replied Jean Valjean.
U||However, Jean Valjean was happy.
U||When Cosette went out with him, she leaned on his arm, proud and happy, in the plenitude of her heart. Jean Valjean felt his heart melt within him with delight, at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive, so wholly satisfied with himself alone. The poor man trembled, inundated with angelic joy; he declared to himself ecstatically that this would last all their lives; he told himself that he really had not suffered sufficiently to merit so radiant a bliss, and he thanked God, in the depths of his soul, for having permitted him to be loved thus, he, a wretch, by that innocent being.
U||CHAPTER V‚ÄîTHE ROSE PERCEIVES THAT IT IS AN ENGINE OF WAR
U||One day, Cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror, and she said to herself: ‚ÄúReally!‚Äù It seemed to her almost that she was pretty. This threw her in a singularly troubled state of mind. Up to that moment she had never thought of her face. She saw herself in her mirror, but she did not look at herself. And then, she had so often been told that she was homely; Jean Valjean alone said gently: ‚ÄúNo indeed! no indeed!‚Äù At all events, Cosette had always thought herself homely, and had grown up in that belief with the easy resignation of childhood. And here, all at once, was her mirror saying to her, as Jean Valjean had said: ‚ÄúNo indeed!‚Äù That night, she did not sleep. ‚ÄúWhat if I were pretty!‚Äù she thought. ‚ÄúHow odd it would be if I were pretty!‚Äù And she recalled those of her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent, and she said to herself: ‚ÄúWhat! Am I to be like Mademoiselle So-and-So?‚Äù
U||The next morning she looked at herself again, not by accident this time, and she was assailed with doubts: ‚ÄúWhere did I get such an idea?‚Äù said she; ‚Äúno, I am ugly.‚Äù She had not slept well, that was all, her eyes were sunken and she was pale. She had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful, but it made her very sad not to be able to believe in it any longer. She did not look at herself again, and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her hair with her back turned to the mirror.
U||In the evening, after dinner, she generally embroidered in wool or did some convent needlework in the drawing-room, and Jean Valjean read beside her. Once she raised her eyes from her work, and was rendered quite uneasy by the manner in which her father was gazing at her.
U||On another occasion, she was passing along the street, and it seemed to her that some one behind her, whom she did not see, said: ‚ÄúA pretty woman! but badly dressed.‚Äù ‚ÄúBah!‚Äù she thought, ‚Äúhe does not mean me. I am well dressed and ugly.‚Äù She was then wearing a plush hat and her merino gown.
U||At last, one day when she was in the garden, she heard poor old Toussaint saying: ‚ÄúDo you notice how pretty Cosette is growing, sir?‚Äù Cosette did not hear her father‚Äôs reply, but Toussaint‚Äôs words caused a sort of commotion within her. She fled from the garden, ran up to her room, flew to the looking-glass,‚Äîit was three months since she had looked at herself,‚Äîand gave vent to a cry. She had just dazzled herself.
U||She was beautiful and lovely; she could not help agreeing with Toussaint and her mirror. Her figure was formed, her skin had grown white, her hair was lustrous, an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blue eyes. The consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant, like the sudden advent of daylight; other people noticed it also, Toussaint had said so, it was evidently she of whom the passer-by had spoken, there could no longer be any doubt of that; she descended to the garden again, thinking herself a queen, imagining that she heard the birds singing, though it was winter, seeing the sky gilded, the sun among the trees, flowers in the thickets, distracted, wild, in inexpressible delight.
U||Jean Valjean, on his side, experienced a deep and undefinable oppression at heart.
U||In fact, he had, for some time past, been contemplating with terror that beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on Cosette‚Äôs sweet face. The dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him.
U||Cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before she became aware of it herself. But, from the very first day, that unexpected light which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl‚Äôs person, wounded Jean Valjean‚Äôs sombre eye. He felt that it was a change in a happy life, a life so happy that he did not dare to move for fear of disarranging something. This man, who had passed through all manner of distresses, who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate, who had been almost wicked and who had become almost a saint, who, after having dragged the chain of the galleys, was now dragging the invisible but heavy chain of indefinite misery, this man whom the law had not released from its grasp and who could be seized at any moment and brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of public opprobrium, this man accepted all, excused all, pardoned all, and merely asked of Providence, of man, of the law, of society, of nature, of the world, one thing, that 
U||Cosette might love him!
U||That Cosette might continue to love him! That God would not prevent the heart of the child from coming to him, and from remaining with him! Beloved by Cosette, he felt that he was healed, rested, appeased, loaded with benefits, recompensed, crowned. Beloved by Cosette, it was well with him! He asked nothing more! Had any one said to him: ‚ÄúDo you want anything better?‚Äù he would have answered: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù God might have said to him: ‚ÄúDo you desire heaven?‚Äù and he would have replied: ‚ÄúI should lose by it.‚Äù
U||Everything which could affect this situation, if only on the surface, made him shudder like the beginning of something new. He had never known very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means; but he understood instinctively, that it was something terrible.
U||He gazed with terror on this beauty, which was blossoming out ever more triumphant and superb beside him, beneath his very eyes, on the innocent and formidable brow of that child, from the depths of her homeliness, of his old age, of his misery, of his reprobation.
U||He said to himself: ‚ÄúHow beautiful she is! What is to become of me?‚Äù
U||There, moreover, lay the difference between his tenderness and the tenderness of a mother. What he beheld with anguish, a mother would have gazed upon with joy.
U||The first symptoms were not long in making their appearance.
U||On the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself: ‚ÄúDecidedly I am beautiful!‚Äù Cosette began to pay attention to her toilet. She recalled the remark of that passer-by: ‚ÄúPretty, but badly dressed,‚Äù the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had vanished, after depositing in her heart one of the two germs which are destined, later on, to fill the whole life of woman, coquetry. Love is the other.
U||With faith in her beauty, the whole feminine soul expanded within her. She conceived a horror for her merinos, and shame for her plush hat. Her father had never refused her anything. She at once acquired the whole science of the bonnet, the gown, the mantle, the boot, the cuff, the stuff which is in fashion, the color which is becoming, that science which makes of the Parisian woman something so charming, so deep, and so dangerous. The words heady woman were invented for the Parisienne.
U||In less than a month, little Cosette, in that Thebaid of the Rue de Babylone, was not only one of the prettiest, but one of the ‚Äúbest dressed‚Äù women in Paris, which means a great deal more.
U||She would have liked to encounter her ‚Äúpasser-by,‚Äù to see what he would say, and to ‚Äúteach him a lesson!‚Äù The truth is, that she was ravishing in every respect, and that she distinguished the difference between a bonnet from G√©rard and one from Herbaut in the most marvellous way.
U||Jean Valjean watched these ravages with anxiety. He who felt that he could never do anything but crawl, walk at the most, beheld wings sprouting on Cosette.
U||Moreover, from the mere inspection of Cosette‚Äôs toilet, a woman would have recognized the fact that she had no mother. Certain little proprieties, certain special conventionalities, were not observed by Cosette. A mother, for instance, would have told her that a young girl does not dress in damask.
U||The first day that Cosette went out in her black damask gown and mantle, and her white crape bonnet, she took Jean Valjean‚Äôs arm, gay, radiant, rosy, proud, dazzling. ‚ÄúFather,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúhow do you like me in this guise?‚Äù Jean Valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voice of an envious man: ‚ÄúCharming!‚Äù He was the same as usual during their walk. On their return home, he asked Cosette:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you put on that other gown and bonnet again,‚Äîyou know the ones I mean?‚Äù
U||This took place in Cosette‚Äôs chamber. Cosette turned towards the wardrobe where her cast-off schoolgirl‚Äôs clothes were hanging.
U||‚ÄúThat disguise!‚Äù said she. ‚ÄúFather, what do you want me to do with it? Oh no, the idea! I shall never put on those horrors again. With that machine on my head, I have the air of Madame Mad-dog.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean heaved a deep sigh.
U||From that moment forth, he noticed that Cosette, who had always heretofore asked to remain at home, saying: ‚ÄúFather, I enjoy myself more here with you,‚Äù now was always asking to go out. In fact, what is the use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not display them?
U||He also noticed that Cosette had no longer the same taste for the back garden. Now she preferred the garden, and did not dislike to promenade back and forth in front of the railed fence. Jean Valjean, who was shy, never set foot in the garden. He kept to his back yard, like a dog.
U||Cosette, in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful, lost the grace of ignoring it. An exquisite grace, for beauty enhanced by ingenuousness is ineffable, and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocent creature who walks along, holding in her hand the key to paradise without being conscious of it. But what she had lost in ingenuous grace, she gained in pensive and serious charm. Her whole person, permeated with the joy of youth, of innocence, and of beauty, breathed forth a splendid melancholy.
U||It was at this epoch that Marius, after the lapse of six months, saw her once more at the Luxembourg.
U||CHAPTER VI‚ÄîTHE BATTLE BEGUN
U||Cosette in her shadow, like Marius in his, was all ready to take fire. Destiny, with its mysterious and fatal patience, slowly drew together these two beings, all charged and all languishing with the stormy electricity of passion, these two souls which were laden with love as two clouds are laden with lightning, and which were bound to overflow and mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire.
U||The glance has been so much abused in love romances that it has finally fallen into disrepute. One hardly dares to say, nowadays, that two beings fell in love because they looked at each other. That is the way people do fall in love, nevertheless, and the only way. The rest is nothing, but the rest comes afterwards. Nothing is more real than these great shocks which two souls convey to each other by the exchange of that spark.
U||At that particular hour when Cosette unconsciously darted that glance which troubled Marius, Marius had no suspicion that he had also launched a look which disturbed Cosette.
U||He caused her the same good and the same evil.
U||She had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time, and she had scrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see, while looking elsewhere. Marius still considered Cosette ugly, when she had already begun to think Marius handsome. But as he paid no attention to her, the young man was nothing to her.
U||Still, she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had beautiful hair, beautiful eyes, handsome teeth, a charming tone of voice when she heard him conversing with his comrades, that he held himself badly when he walked, if you like, but with a grace that was all his own, that he did not appear to be at all stupid, that his whole person was noble, gentle, simple, proud, and that, in short, though he seemed to be poor, yet his air was fine.
U||On the day when their eyes met at last, and said to each other those first, obscure, and ineffable things which the glance lisps, Cosette did not immediately understand. She returned thoughtfully to the house in the Rue de l‚ÄôOuest, where Jean Valjean, according to his custom, had come to spend six weeks. The next morning, on waking, she thought of that strange young man, so long indifferent and icy, who now seemed to pay attention to her, and it did not appear to her that this attention was the least in the world agreeable to her. She was, on the contrary, somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual. A substratum of war stirred within her. It struck her, and the idea caused her a wholly childish joy, that she was going to take her revenge at last.
U||Knowing that she was beautiful, she was thoroughly conscious, though in an indistinct fashion, that she possessed a weapon. Women play with their beauty as children do with a knife. They wound themselves.
U||The reader will recall Marius‚Äô hesitations, his palpitations, his terrors. He remained on his bench and did not approach. This vexed Cosette. One day, she said to Jean Valjean: ‚ÄúFather, let us stroll about a little in that direction.‚Äù Seeing that Marius did not come to her, she went to him. In such cases, all women resemble Mahomet. And then, strange to say, the first symptom of true love in a young man is timidity; in a young girl it is boldness. This is surprising, and yet nothing is more simple. It is the two sexes tending to approach each other and assuming, each the other‚Äôs qualities.
U||That day, Cosette‚Äôs glance drove Marius beside himself, and Marius‚Äô glance set Cosette to trembling. Marius went away confident, and Cosette uneasy. From that day forth, they adored each other.
U||The first thing that Cosette felt was a confused and profound melancholy. It seemed to her that her soul had become black since the day before. She no longer recognized it. The whiteness of soul in young girls, which is composed of coldness and gayety, resembles snow. It melts in love, which is its sun.
U||Cosette did not know what love was. She had never heard the word uttered in its terrestrial sense. On the books of profane music which entered the convent, amour (love) was replaced by tambour (drum) or pandour. This created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the big girls, such as: Ah, how delightful is the drum! or, Pity is not a pandour. But Cosette had left the convent too early to have occupied herself much with the ‚Äúdrum.‚Äù Therefore, she did not know what name to give to what she now felt. Is any one the less ill because one does not know the name of one‚Äôs malady?
U||She loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly. She did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, useful or dangerous, eternal or temporary, allowable or prohibited; she loved. She would have been greatly astonished, had any one said to her: ‚ÄúYou do not sleep? But that is forbidden! You do not eat? Why, that is very bad! You have oppressions and palpitations of the heart? That must not be! You blush and turn pale, when a certain being clad in black appears at the end of a certain green walk? But that is abominable!‚Äù She would not have understood, and she would have replied: ‚ÄúWhat fault is there of mine in a matter in which I have no power and of which I know nothing?‚Äù
U||It turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited to the state of her soul. It was a sort of admiration at a distance, a mute contemplation, the deification of a stranger. It was the apparition of youth to youth, the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining a dream, the longed-for phantom realized and made flesh at last, but having as yet, neither name, nor fault, nor spot, nor exigence, nor defect; in a word, the distant lover who lingered in the ideal, a chim√¶ra with a form. Any nearer and more palpable meeting would have alarmed Cosette at this first stage, when she was still half immersed in the exaggerated mists of the cloister. She had all the fears of children and all the fears of nuns combined. The spirit of the convent, with which she had been permeated for the space of five years, was still in the process of slow evaporation from her person, and made everything tremble around her. In this situation he was not a lover, he was not even an admirer, he was a vision. She set h
U||erself to adoring Marius as something charming, luminous, and impossible.
U||As extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry, she smiled at him with all frankness.
U||Every day, she looked forward to the hour for their walk with impatience, she found Marius there, she felt herself unspeakably happy, and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought when she said to Jean Valjean:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat a delicious garden that Luxembourg is!‚Äù
U||Marius and Cosette were in the dark as to one another. They did not address each other, they did not salute each other, they did not know each other; they saw each other; and like stars of heaven which are separated by millions of leagues, they lived by gazing at each other.
U||It was thus that Cosette gradually became a woman and developed, beautiful and loving, with a consciousness of her beauty, and in ignorance of her love. She was a coquette to boot through her ignorance.
U||CHAPTER VII‚ÄîTO ONE SADNESS OPPOSE A SADNESS AND A HALF
U||All situations have their instincts. Old and eternal Mother Nature warned Jean Valjean in a dim way of the presence of Marius. Jean Valjean shuddered to the very bottom of his soul. Jean Valjean saw nothing, knew nothing, and yet he scanned with obstinate attention, the darkness in which he walked, as though he felt on one side of him something in process of construction, and on the other, something which was crumbling away. Marius, also warned, and, in accordance with the deep law of God, by that same Mother Nature, did all he could to keep out of sight of ‚Äúthe father.‚Äù Nevertheless, it came to pass that Jean Valjean sometimes espied him. Marius‚Äô manners were no longer in the least natural. He exhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring. He no longer came quite close to them as formerly. He seated himself at a distance and pretended to be reading; why did he pretend that? Formerly he had come in his old coat, now he wore his new one every day; Jean Valjean was not sure that he did not have his hai
U||r curled, his eyes were very queer, he wore gloves; in short, Jean Valjean cordially detested this young man.
U||Cosette allowed nothing to be divined. Without knowing just what was the matter with her she was convinced that there was something in it, and that it must be concealed.
U||There was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had recently come to Cosette, and the habit of new clothes developed by that stranger which was very repugnant to Jean Valjean. It might be accidental, no doubt, certainly, but it was a menacing accident.
U||He never opened his mouth to Cosette about this stranger. One day, however, he could not refrain from so doing, and, with that vague despair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair, he said to her: ‚ÄúWhat a very pedantic air that young man has!‚Äù
U||Cosette, but a year before only an indifferent little girl, would have replied: ‚ÄúWhy, no, he is charming.‚Äù Ten years later, with the love of Marius in her heart, she would have answered: ‚ÄúA pedant, and insufferable to the sight! You are right!‚Äù‚ÄîAt the moment in life and the heart which she had then attained, she contented herself with replying, with supreme calmness: ‚ÄúThat young man!‚Äù
U||As though she now beheld him for the first time in her life.
U||‚ÄúHow stupid I am!‚Äù thought Jean Valjean. ‚ÄúShe had not noticed him. It is I who have pointed him out to her.‚Äù
U||Oh, simplicity of the old! oh, the depth of children!
U||It is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble, of those vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles, that the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap whatever, and that the young man falls into every one. Jean Valjean had instituted an undeclared war against Marius, which Marius, with the sublime stupidity of his passion and his age, did not divine. Jean Valjean laid a host of ambushes for him; he changed his hour, he changed his bench, he forgot his handkerchief, he came alone to the Luxembourg; Marius dashed headlong into all these snares; and to all the interrogation marks planted by Jean Valjean in his pathway, he ingenuously answered ‚Äúyes.‚Äù But Cosette remained immured in her apparent unconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity, so that Jean Valjean arrived at the following conclusion: ‚ÄúThat ninny is madly in love with Cosette, but Cosette does not even know that he exists.‚Äù
U||Nonetheless did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor. The minute when Cosette would love might strike at any moment. Does not everything begin with indifference?
U||Only once did Cosette make a mistake and alarm him. He rose from his seat to depart, after a stay of three hours, and she said: ‚ÄúWhat, already?‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean had not discontinued his trips to the Luxembourg, as he did not wish to do anything out of the way, and as, above all things, he feared to arouse Cosette; but during the hours which were so sweet to the lovers, while Cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated Marius, who perceived nothing else now, and who now saw nothing in all the world but an adored and radiant face, Jean Valjean was fixing on Marius flashing and terrible eyes. He, who had finally come to believe himself incapable of a malevolent feeling, experienced moments when Marius was present, in which he thought he was becoming savage and ferocious once more, and he felt the old depths of his soul, which had formerly contained so much wrath, opening once more and rising up against that young man. It almost seemed to him that unknown craters were forming in his bosom.
U||What! he was there, that creature! What was he there for? He came creeping about, smelling out, examining, trying! He came, saying: ‚ÄúHey! Why not?‚Äù He came to prowl about his, Jean Valjean‚Äôs, life! to prowl about his happiness, with the purpose of seizing it and bearing it away!
U||Jean Valjean added: ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs it! What is he in search of? An adventure! What does he want? A love affair! A love affair! And I? What! I have been first, the most wretched of men, and then the most unhappy, and I have traversed sixty years of life on my knees, I have suffered everything that man can suffer, I have grown old without having been young, I have lived without a family, without relatives, without friends, without life, without children, I have left my blood on every stone, on every bramble, on every mile-post, along every wall, I have been gentle, though others have been hard to me, and kind, although others have been malicious, I have become an honest man once more, in spite of everything, I have repented of the evil that I have done and have forgiven the evil that has been done to me, and at the moment when I receive my recompense, at the moment when it is all over, at the moment when I am just touching the goal, at the moment when I have what I desire, it is well, it is good, I have paid
U||, I have earned it, all this is to take flight, all this will vanish, and I shall lose Cosette, and I shall lose my life, my joy, my soul, because it has pleased a great booby to come and lounge at the Luxembourg.‚Äù
U||Then his eyes were filled with a sad and extraordinary gleam.
U||It was no longer a man gazing at a man; it was no longer an enemy surveying an enemy. It was a dog scanning a thief.
U||The reader knows the rest. Marius pursued his senseless course. One day he followed Cosette to the Rue de l‚ÄôOuest. Another day he spoke to the porter. The porter, on his side, spoke, and said to Jean Valjean: ‚ÄúMonsieur, who is that curious young man who is asking for you?‚Äù On the morrow Jean Valjean bestowed on Marius that glance which Marius at last perceived. A week later, Jean Valjean had taken his departure. He swore to himself that he would never again set foot either in the Luxembourg or in the Rue de l‚ÄôOuest. He returned to the Rue Plumet.
U||Cosette did not complain, she said nothing, she asked no questions, she did not seek to learn his reasons; she had already reached the point where she was afraid of being divined, and of betraying herself. Jean Valjean had no experience of these miseries, the only miseries which are charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted; the consequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of Cosette‚Äôs silence.
U||He merely noticed that she had grown sad, and he grew gloomy. On his side and on hers, inexperience had joined issue.
U||Once he made a trial. He asked Cosette:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWould you like to come to the Luxembourg?‚Äù
U||A ray illuminated Cosette‚Äôs pale face.
U||‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said she.
U||They went thither. Three months had elapsed. Marius no longer went there. Marius was not there.
U||On the following day, Jean Valjean asked Cosette again:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWould you like to come to the Luxembourg?‚Äù
U||She replied, sadly and gently:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean was hurt by this sadness, and heart-broken at this gentleness.
U||What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable? What was on its way there within? What was taking place in Cosette‚Äôs soul? Sometimes, instead of going to bed, Jean Valjean remained seated on his pallet, with his head in his hands, and he passed whole nights asking himself: ‚ÄúWhat has Cosette in her mind?‚Äù and in thinking of the things that she might be thinking about.
U||Oh! at such moments, what mournful glances did he cast towards that cloister, that chaste peak, that abode of angels, that inaccessible glacier of virtue! How he contemplated, with despairing ecstasy, that convent garden, full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins, where all perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven! How he adored that Eden forever closed against him, whence he had voluntarily and madly emerged! How he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having brought Cosette back into the world, poor hero of sacrifice, seized and hurled to the earth by his very self-devotion! How he said to himself, ‚ÄúWhat have I done?‚Äù
U||However, nothing of all this was perceptible to Cosette. No ill-temper, no harshness. His face was always serene and kind. Jean Valjean‚Äôs manners were more tender and more paternal than ever. If anything could have betrayed his lack of joy, it was his increased suavity.
U||On her side, Cosette languished. She suffered from the absence of Marius as she had rejoiced in his presence, peculiarly, without exactly being conscious of it. When Jean Valjean ceased to take her on their customary strolls, a feminine instinct murmured confusedly, at the bottom of her heart, that she must not seem to set store on the Luxembourg garden, and that if this proved to be a matter of indifference to her, her father would take her thither once more. But days, weeks, months, elapsed. Jean Valjean had tacitly accepted Cosette‚Äôs tacit consent. She regretted it. It was too late. So Marius had disappeared; all was over. The day on which she returned to the Luxembourg, Marius was no longer there. What was to be done? Should she ever find him again? She felt an anguish at her heart, which nothing relieved, and which augmented every day; she no longer knew whether it was winter or summer, whether it was raining or shining, whether the birds were singing, whether it was the season for dahlias or daisies,
U|| whether the Luxembourg was more charming than the Tuileries, whether the linen which the laundress brought home was starched too much or not enough, whether Toussaint had done ‚Äúher marketing‚Äù well or ill; and she remained dejected, absorbed, attentive to but a single thought, her eyes vague and staring as when one gazes by night at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished.
U||However, she did not allow Jean Valjean to perceive anything of this, except her pallor.
U||She still wore her sweet face for him.
U||This pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble Jean Valjean. Sometimes he asked her:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat is the matter with you?‚Äù
U||She replied: ‚ÄúThere is nothing the matter with me.‚Äù
U||And after a silence, when she divined that he was sad also, she would add:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúAnd you, father‚Äîis there anything wrong with you?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWith me? Nothing,‚Äù said he.
U||These two beings who had loved each other so exclusively, and with so touching an affection, and who had lived so long for each other now suffered side by side, each on the other‚Äôs account; without acknowledging it to each other, without anger towards each other, and with a smile.
U||CHAPTER VIII‚ÄîTHE CHAIN-GANG
U||Jean Valjean was the more unhappy of the two. Youth, even in its sorrows, always possesses its own peculiar radiance.
U||At times, Jean Valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile. It is the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear. He had an unconquerable conviction that Cosette was escaping from him. He would have liked to resist, to retain her, to arouse her enthusiasm by some external and brilliant matter. These ideas, puerile, as we have just said, and at the same time senile, conveyed to him, by their very childishness, a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on the imaginations of young girls. He once chanced to see a general on horseback, in full uniform, pass along the street, Comte Coutard, the commandant of Paris. He envied that gilded man; what happiness it would be, he said to himself, if he could put on that suit which was an incontestable thing; and if Cosette could behold him thus, she would be dazzled, and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the Tuileries, the guard would present arms to him, and that would suffice for Cosette, and would dispel her
U|| idea of looking at young men.
U||An unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections.
U||In the isolated life which they led, and since they had come to dwell in the Rue Plumet, they had contracted one habit. They sometimes took a pleasure trip to see the sun rise, a mild species of enjoyment which befits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it.
U||For those who love solitude, a walk in the early morning is equivalent to a stroll by night, with the cheerfulness of nature added. The streets are deserted and the birds are singing. Cosette, a bird herself, liked to rise early. These matutinal excursions were planned on the preceding evening. He proposed, and she agreed. It was arranged like a plot, they set out before daybreak, and these trips were so many small delights for Cosette. These innocent eccentricities please young people.
U||Jean Valjean‚Äôs inclination led him, as we have seen, to the least frequented spots, to solitary nooks, to forgotten places. There then existed, in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris, a sort of poor meadows, which were almost confounded with the city, where grew in summer sickly grain, and which, in autumn, after the harvest had been gathered, presented the appearance, not of having been reaped, but peeled. Jean Valjean loved to haunt these fields. Cosette was not bored there. It meant solitude to him and liberty to her. There, she became a little girl once more, she could run and almost play; she took off her hat, laid it on Jean Valjean‚Äôs knees, and gathered bunches of flowers. She gazed at the butterflies on the flowers, but did not catch them; gentleness and tenderness are born with love, and the young girl who cherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of a butterfly. She wove garlands of poppies, which she placed on her head, and which, crossed and penetrated 
U||with sunlight, glowing until they flamed, formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers.
U||Even after their life had grown sad, they kept up their custom of early strolls.
U||One morning in October, therefore, tempted by the serene perfection of the autumn of 1831, they set out, and found themselves at break of day near the Barri√®re du Maine. It was not dawn, it was daybreak; a delightful and stern moment. A few constellations here and there in the deep, pale azure, the earth all black, the heavens all white, a quiver amid the blades of grass, everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight. A lark, which seemed mingled with the stars, was carolling at a prodigious height, and one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmed immensity. In the East, the Val-de-Gr√¢ce projected its dark mass on the clear horizon with the sharpness of steel; Venus dazzlingly brilliant was rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its escape from a gloomy edifice.
U||All was peace and silence; there was no one on the road; a few stray laborers, of whom they caught barely a glimpse, were on their way to their work along the side-paths.
U||Jean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks deposited at the gate of a timber-yard. His face was turned towards the highway, his back towards the light; he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of rising; he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated, which imprison even the eye, and which are equivalent to four walls. There are meditations which may be called vertical; when one is at the bottom of them, time is required to return to earth. Jean Valjean had plunged into one of these reveries. He was thinking of Cosette, of the happiness that was possible if nothing came between him and her, of the light with which she filled his life, a light which was but the emanation of her soul. He was almost happy in his reverie. Cosette, who was standing beside him, was gazing at the clouds as they turned rosy.
U||All at once Cosette exclaimed: ‚ÄúFather, I should think some one was coming yonder.‚Äù Jean Valjean raised his eyes.
U||Cosette was right. The causeway which leads to the ancient Barri√®re du Maine is a prolongation, as the reader knows, of the Rue de S√®vres, and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard. At the elbow of the causeway and the boulevard, at the spot where it branches, they heard a noise which it was difficult to account for at that hour, and a sort of confused pile made its appearance. Some shapeless thing which was coming from the boulevard was turning into the road.
U||It grew larger, it seemed to move in an orderly manner, though it was bristling and quivering; it seemed to be a vehicle, but its load could not be distinctly made out. There were horses, wheels, shouts; whips were cracking. By degrees the outlines became fixed, although bathed in shadows. It was a vehicle, in fact, which had just turned from the boulevard into the highway, and which was directing its course towards the barrier near which sat Jean Valjean; a second, of the same aspect, followed, then a third, then a fourth; seven chariots made their appearance in succession, the heads of the horses touching the rear of the wagon in front. Figures were moving on these vehicles, flashes were visible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there, a clanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains, and as this something advanced, the sound of voices waxed louder, and it turned into a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams.
U||As it drew nearer, it assumed a form, and was outlined behind the trees with the pallid hue of an apparition; the mass grew white; the day, which was slowly dawning, cast a wan light on this swarming heap which was at once both sepulchral and living, the heads of the figures turned into the faces of corpses, and this is what it proved to be:‚Äî
U||Seven wagons were driving in a file along the road. The first six were singularly constructed. They resembled coopers‚Äô drays; they consisted of long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear extremities. Each dray, or rather let us say, each ladder, was attached to four horses harnessed tandem. On these ladders strange clusters of men were being drawn. In the faint light, these men were to be divined rather than seen. Twenty-four on each vehicle, twelve on a side, back to back, facing the passers-by, their legs dangling in the air,‚Äîthis was the manner in which these men were travelling, and behind their backs they had something which clanked, and which was a chain, and on their necks something which shone, and which was an iron collar. Each man had his collar, but the chain was for all; so that if these four and twenty men had occasion to alight from the dray and walk, they were seized with a sort of inexorable unity, and were obliged to wind over the ground with the chain for a back
U||bone, somewhat after the fashion of millepeds. In the back and front of each vehicle, two men armed with muskets stood erect, each holding one end of the chain under his foot. The iron necklets were square. The seventh vehicle, a huge rack-sided baggage wagon, without a hood, had four wheels and six horses, and carried a sonorous pile of iron boilers, cast-iron pots, braziers, and chains, among which were mingled several men who were pinioned and stretched at full length, and who seemed to be ill. This wagon, all lattice-work, was garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to have served for former punishments. These vehicles kept to the middle of the road. On each side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect, wearing three-cornered hats, like the soldiers under the Directory, shabby, covered with spots and holes, muffled in uniforms of veterans and the trousers of undertakers‚Äô men, half gray, half blue, which were almost hanging in rags, with red epaulets, yellow shoulder belts, short s
U||abres, muskets, and cudgels; they were a species of soldier-blackguards. These myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness of the beggar and the authority of the executioner. The one who appeared to be their chief held a postilion‚Äôs whip in his hand. All these details, blurred by the dimness of dawn, became more and more clearly outlined as the light increased. At the head and in the rear of the convoy rode mounted gendarmes, serious and with sword in fist.
U||This procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the barrier, the last was barely debauching from the boulevard. A throng, sprung, it is impossible to say whence, and formed in a twinkling, as is frequently the case in Paris, pressed forward from both sides of the road and looked on. In the neighboring lanes the shouts of people calling to each other and the wooden shoes of market-gardeners hastening up to gaze were audible.
U||The men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in silence. They were livid with the chill of morning. They all wore linen trousers, and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes. The rest of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness. Their accoutrements were horribly incongruous; nothing is more funereal than the harlequin in rags. Battered felt hats, tarpaulin caps, hideous woollen nightcaps, and, side by side with a short blouse, a black coat broken at the elbow; many wore women‚Äôs headgear, others had baskets on their heads; hairy breasts were visible, and through the rent in their garments tattooed designs could be descried; temples of Love, flaming hearts, Cupids; eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen. Two or three had a straw rope attached to the cross-bar of the dray, and suspended under them like a stirrup, which supported their feet. One of them held in his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the appearance of a black stone and which he seem
U||ed to be gnawing; it was bread which he was eating. There were no eyes there which were not either dry, dulled, or flaming with an evil light. The escort troop cursed, the men in chains did not utter a syllable; from time to time the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder-blades or skulls; some of these men were yawning; their rags were terrible; their feet hung down, their shoulders oscillated, their heads clashed together, their fetters clanked, their eyes glared ferociously, their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses; in the rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter.
U||This file of vehicles, whatever its nature was, was mournful. It was evident that to-morrow, that an hour hence, a pouring rain might descend, that it might be followed by another and another, and that their dilapidated garments would be drenched, that once soaked, these men would not get dry again, that once chilled, they would not again get warm, that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by the downpour, that the water would fill their shoes, that no lashes from the whips would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering, that the chain would continue to bind them by the neck, that their legs would continue to dangle, and it was impossible not to shudder at the sight of these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold clouds of autumn, and delivered over to the rain, to the blast, to all the furies of the air, like trees and stones.
U||Blows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick men, who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh wagon, and who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled with misery.
U||Suddenly, the sun made its appearance; the immense light of the Orient burst forth, and one would have said that it had set fire to all those ferocious heads. Their tongues were unloosed; a conflagration of grins, oaths, and songs exploded. The broad horizontal sheet of light severed the file in two parts, illuminating heads and bodies, leaving feet and wheels in the obscurity. Thoughts made their appearance on these faces; it was a terrible moment; visible demons with their masks removed, fierce souls laid bare. Though lighted up, this wild throng remained in gloom. Some, who were gay, had in their mouths quills through which they blew vermin over the crowd, picking out the women; the dawn accentuated these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its shadows; there was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason of wretchedness; and the whole was so monstrous that one would have said that the sun‚Äôs brilliancy had been changed into the glare of the lightning. The wagon-load which headed the
U|| line had struck up a song, and were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard joviality, a pot-pourri by Desaugiers, then famous, called The Vestal; the trees shivered mournfully; in the cross-lanes, countenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic delight to these coarse strains droned by spectres.
U||All sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos; here were to be found the facial angles of every sort of beast, old men, youths, bald heads, gray beards, cynical monstrosities, sour resignation, savage grins, senseless attitudes, snouts surmounted by caps, heads like those of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples, infantile visages, and by reason of that, horrible thin skeleton faces, to which death alone was lacking. On the first cart was a negro, who had been a slave, in all probability, and who could make a comparison of his chains. The frightful leveller from below, shame, had passed over these brows; at that degree of abasement, the last transformations were suffered by all in their extremest depths, and ignorance, converted into dulness, was the equal of intelligence converted into despair. There was no choice possible between these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the mud. It was evident that the person who had had the ordering of that unclean procession had not classif
U||ied them. These beings had been fettered and coupled pell-mell, in alphabetical disorder, probably, and loaded hap-hazard on those carts. Nevertheless, horrors, when grouped together, always end by evolving a result; all additions of wretched men give a sum total, each chain exhaled a common soul, and each dray-load had its own physiognomy. By the side of the one where they were singing, there was one where they were howling; a third where they were begging; one could be seen in which they were gnashing their teeth; another load menaced the spectators, another blasphemed God; the last was as silent as the tomb. Dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell on the march. The march of the damned to their tortures, performed in sinister wise, not on the formidable and flaming chariot of the Apocalypse, but, what was more mournful than that, on the gibbet cart.
U||One of the guards, who had a hook on the end of his cudgel, made a pretence from time to time, of stirring up this mass of human filth. An old woman in the crowd pointed them out to her little boy five years old, and said to him: ‚ÄúRascal, let that be a warning to you!‚Äù
U||As the songs and blasphemies increased, the man who appeared to be the captain of the escort cracked his whip, and at that signal a fearful dull and blind flogging, which produced the sound of hail, fell upon the seven dray-loads; many roared and foamed at the mouth; which redoubled the delight of the street urchins who had hastened up, a swarm of flies on these wounds.
U||Jean Valjean‚Äôs eyes had assumed a frightful expression. They were no longer eyes; they were those deep and glassy objects which replace the glance in the case of certain wretched men, which seem unconscious of reality, and in which flames the reflection of terrors and of catastrophes. He was not looking at a spectacle, he was seeing a vision. He tried to rise, to flee, to make his escape; he could not move his feet. Sometimes, the things that you see seize upon you and hold you fast. He remained nailed to the spot, petrified, stupid, asking himself, athwart confused and inexpressible anguish, what this sepulchral persecution signified, and whence had come that pandemonium which was pursuing him. All at once, he raised his hand to his brow, a gesture habitual to those whose memory suddenly returns; he remembered that this was, in fact, the usual itinerary, that it was customary to make this detour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering royalty on the road to Fontainebleau, and that, five and thir
U||ty years before, he had himself passed through that barrier.
U||Cosette was no less terrified, but in a different way. She did not understand; what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible; at length she cried:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFather! What are those men in those carts?‚Äù
U||Jean Valjean replied: ‚ÄúConvicts.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhither are they going?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúTo the galleys.‚Äù
U||At that moment, the cudgelling, multiplied by a hundred hands, became zealous, blows with the flat of the sword were mingled with it, it was a perfect storm of whips and clubs; the convicts bent before it, a hideous obedience was evoked by the torture, and all held their peace, darting glances like chained wolves.
U||Cosette trembled in every limb; she resumed:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúFather, are they still men?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù answered the unhappy man.
U||It was the chain-gang, in fact, which had set out before daybreak from Bic√™tre, and had taken the road to Mans in order to avoid Fontainebleau, where the King then was. This caused the horrible journey to last three or four days longer; but torture may surely be prolonged with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it.
U||Jean Valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed. Such encounters are shocks, and the memory that they leave behind them resembles a thorough shaking up.
U||Nevertheless, Jean Valjean did not observe that, on his way back to the Rue de Babylone with Cosette, the latter was plying him with other questions on the subject of what they had just seen; perhaps he was too much absorbed in his own dejection to notice her words and reply to them. But when Cosette was leaving him in the evening, to betake herself to bed, he heard her say in a low voice, and as though talking to herself: ‚ÄúIt seems to me, that if I were to find one of those men in my pathway, oh, my God, I should die merely from the sight of him close at hand.‚Äù
U||Fortunately, chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day, there was some official solemnity apropos of I know not what,‚Äîf√™tes in Paris, a review in the Champ de Mars, jousts on the Seine, theatrical performances in the Champs-√âlys√©es, fireworks at the Arc de l‚Äô√âtoile, illuminations everywhere. Jean Valjean did violence to his habits, and took Cosette to see these rejoicings, for the purpose of diverting her from the memory of the day before, and of effacing, beneath the smiling tumult of all Paris, the abominable thing which had passed before her. The review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of uniforms perfectly natural; Jean Valjean donned his uniform of a national guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking himself to shelter. However, this trip seemed to attain its object. Cosette, who made it her law to please her father, and to whom, moreover, all spectacles were a novelty, accepted this diversion with the light and easy good grace of youth, and did
U|| not pout too disdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public f√™te; so that Jean Valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded, and that no trace of that hideous vision remained.
U||Some days later, one morning, when the sun was shining brightly, and they were both on the steps leading to the garden, another infraction of the rules which Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself, and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused Cosette to adopt, Cosette, in a wrapper, was standing erect in that negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an adorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star; and, with her head bathed in light, rosy after a good sleep, submitting to the gentle glances of the tender old man, she was picking a daisy to pieces. Cosette did not know the delightful legend, I love a little, passionately, etc.‚Äîwho was there who could have taught her? She was handling the flower instinctively, innocently, without a suspicion that to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart. If there were a fourth, and smiling Grace called Melancholy, she would have worn the air of that Grace. Jean Valjean was fasc
U||inated by the contemplation of those tiny fingers on that flower, and forgetful of everything in the radiance emitted by that child. A red-breast was warbling in the thicket, on one side. White cloudlets floated across the sky, so gayly, that one would have said that they had just been set at liberty. Cosette went on attentively tearing the leaves from her flower; she seemed to be thinking about something; but whatever it was, it must be something charming; all at once she turned her head over her shoulder with the delicate languor of a swan, and said to Jean Valjean: ‚ÄúFather, what are the galleys like?‚Äù
U||BOOK FOURTH‚ÄîSUCCOR FROM BELOW MAY TURN OUT TO BE SUCCOR FROM ON HIGH
U||CHAPTER I‚ÄîA WOUND WITHOUT, HEALING WITHIN
U||Thus their life clouded over by degrees.
U||But one diversion, which had formerly been a happiness, remained to them, which was to carry bread to those who were hungry, and clothing to those who were cold. Cosette often accompanied Jean Valjean on these visits to the poor, on which they recovered some remnants of their former free intercourse; and sometimes, when the day had been a good one, and they had assisted many in distress, and cheered and warmed many little children, Cosette was rather merry in the evening. It was at this epoch that they paid their visit to the Jondrette den.
U||On the day following that visit, Jean Valjean made his appearance in the pavilion in the morning, calm as was his wont, but with a large wound on his left arm which was much inflamed, and very angry, which resembled a burn, and which he explained in some way or other. This wound resulted in his being detained in the house for a month with fever. He would not call in a doctor. When Cosette urged him, ‚ÄúCall the dog-doctor,‚Äù said he.
U||Cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air and such angelic happiness at being of use to him, that Jean Valjean felt all his former joy returning, his fears and anxieties dissipating, and he gazed at Cosette, saying: ‚ÄúOh! what a kindly wound! Oh! what a good misfortune!‚Äù
U||Cosette on perceiving that her father was ill, had deserted the pavilion and again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back courtyard. She passed nearly all her days beside Jean Valjean and read to him the books which he desired. Generally they were books of travel. Jean Valjean was undergoing a new birth; his happiness was reviving in these ineffable rays; the Luxembourg, the prowling young stranger, Cosette‚Äôs coldness,‚Äîall these clouds upon his soul were growing dim. He had reached the point where he said to himself: ‚ÄúI imagined all that. I am an old fool.‚Äù
U||His happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of the Th√©nardiers made in the Jondrette hovel, unexpected as it was, had, after a fashion, glided over him unnoticed. He had succeeded in making his escape; all trace of him was lost‚Äîwhat more did he care for! he only thought of those wretched beings to pity them. ‚ÄúHere they are in prison, and henceforth they will be incapacitated for doing any harm,‚Äù he thought, ‚Äúbut what a lamentable family in distress!‚Äù
U||As for the hideous vision of the Barri√®re du Maine, Cosette had not referred to it again.
U||Sister Sainte-Mechtilde had taught Cosette music in the convent; Cosette had the voice of a linnet with a soul, and sometimes, in the evening, in the wounded man‚Äôs humble abode, she warbled melancholy songs which delighted Jean Valjean.
U||Spring came; the garden was so delightful at that season of the year, that Jean Valjean said to Cosette:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúYou never go there; I want you to stroll in it.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAs you like, father,‚Äù said Cosette.
U||And for the sake of obeying her father, she resumed her walks in the garden, generally alone, for, as we have mentioned, Jean Valjean, who was probably afraid of being seen through the fence, hardly ever went there.
U||Jean Valjean‚Äôs wound had created a diversion.
U||When Cosette saw that her father was suffering less, that he was convalescing, and that he appeared to be happy, she experienced a contentment which she did not even perceive, so gently and naturally had it come. Then, it was in the month of March, the days were growing longer, the winter was departing, the winter always bears away with it a portion of our sadness; then came April, that daybreak of summer, fresh as dawn always is, gay like every childhood; a little inclined to weep at times like the new-born being that it is. In that month, nature has charming gleams which pass from the sky, from the trees, from the meadows and the flowers into the heart of man.
U||Cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of that April joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself. Insensibly, and without her suspecting the fact, the blackness departed from her spirit. In spring, sad souls grow light, as light falls into cellars at midday. Cosette was no longer sad. However, though this was so, she did not account for it to herself. In the morning, about ten o‚Äôclock, after breakfast, when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the garden for a quarter of an hour, and when she was pacing up and down in the sunlight in front of the steps, supporting his left arm for him, she did not perceive that she laughed every moment and that she was happy.
U||Jean Valjean, intoxicated, beheld her growing fresh and rosy once more.
U||‚ÄúOh! What a good wound!‚Äù he repeated in a whisper.
U||And he felt grateful to the Th√©nardiers.
U||His wound once healed, he resumed his solitary twilight strolls.
U||It is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone in that fashion in the uninhabited regions of Paris without meeting with some adventure.
U||CHAPTER II‚ÄîMOTHER PLUTARQUE FINDS NO DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING A PHENOMENON
U||One evening, little Gavroche had had nothing to eat; he remembered that he had not dined on the preceding day either; this was becoming tiresome. He resolved to make an effort to secure some supper. He strolled out beyond the Salp√™tri√®re into deserted regions; that is where windfalls are to be found; where there is no one, one always finds something. He reached a settlement which appeared to him to be the village of Austerlitz.
U||In one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden haunted by an old man and an old woman, and in that garden, a passable apple-tree. Beside the apple-tree stood a sort of fruit-house, which was not securely fastened, and where one might contrive to get an apple. One apple is a supper; one apple is life. That which was Adam‚Äôs ruin might prove Gavroche‚Äôs salvation. The garden abutted on a solitary, unpaved lane, bordered with brushwood while awaiting the arrival of houses; the garden was separated from it by a hedge.
U||Gavroche directed his steps towards this garden; he found the lane, he recognized the apple-tree, he verified the fruit-house, he examined the hedge; a hedge means merely one stride. The day was declining, there was not even a cat in the lane, the hour was propitious. Gavroche began the operation of scaling the hedge, then suddenly paused. Some one was talking in the garden. Gavroche peeped through one of the breaks in the hedge.
U||Succor from Below
U||A couple of paces distant, at the foot of the hedge on the other side, exactly at the point where the gap which he was meditating would have been made, there was a sort of recumbent stone which formed a bench, and on this bench was seated the old man of the garden, while the old woman was standing in front of him. The old woman was grumbling. Gavroche, who was not very discreet, listened.
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Mabeuf!‚Äù said the old woman.
U||‚ÄúMabeuf!‚Äù thought Gavroche, ‚Äúthat name is a perfect farce.‚Äù
U||The old man who was thus addressed, did not stir. The old woman repeated:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúMonsieur Mabeuf!‚Äù
U||The old man, without raising his eyes from the ground, made up his mind to answer:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúWhat is it, Mother Plutarque?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúMother Plutarque!‚Äù thought Gavroche, ‚Äúanother farcical name.‚Äù
U||Mother Plutarque began again, and the old man was forced to accept the conversation:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúThe landlord is not pleased.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWe owe three quarters rent.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIn three months, we shall owe him for four quarters.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúHe says that he will turn you out to sleep.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI will go.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe green-grocer insists on being paid. She will no longer leave her fagots. What will you warm yourself with this winter? We shall have no wood.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThere is the sun.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe butcher refuses to give credit; he will not let us have any more meat.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is quite right. I do not digest meat well. It is too heavy.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat shall we have for dinner?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBread.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThe baker demands a settlement, and says, ‚Äòno money, no bread.‚Äô‚Äù
U||‚ÄúThat is well.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat will you eat?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWe have apples in the apple-room.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúBut, Monsieur, we can‚Äôt live like that without money.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúI have none.‚Äù
U||The old woman went away, the old man remained alone. He fell into thought. Gavroche became thoughtful also. It was almost dark.
U||The first result of Gavroche‚Äôs meditation was, that instead of scaling the hedge, he crouched down under it. The branches stood apart a little at the foot of the thicket.
U||‚ÄúCome,‚Äù exclaimed Gavroche mentally, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a nook!‚Äù and he curled up in it. His back was almost in contact with Father Mabeuf‚Äôs bench. He could hear the octogenarian breathe.
U||Then, by way of dinner, he tried to sleep.
U||It was a cat-nap, with one eye open. While he dozed, Gavroche kept on the watch.
U||The twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth, and the lane formed a livid line between two rows of dark bushes.
U||All at once, in this whitish band, two figures made their appearance. One was in front, the other some distance in the rear.
U||‚ÄúThere come two creatures,‚Äù muttered Gavroche.
U||The first form seemed to be some elderly bourgeois, who was bent and thoughtful, dressed more than plainly, and who was walking slowly because of his age, and strolling about in the open evening air.
U||The second was straight, firm, slender. It regulated its pace by that of the first; but in the voluntary slowness of its gait, suppleness and agility were discernible. This figure had also something fierce and disquieting about it, the whole shape was that of what was then called an elegant; the hat was of good shape, the coat black, well cut, probably of fine cloth, and well fitted in at the waist. The head was held erect with a sort of robust grace, and beneath the hat the pale profile of a young man could be made out in the dim light. The profile had a rose in its mouth. This second form was well known to Gavroche; it was Montparnasse.
U||He could have told nothing about the other, except that he was a respectable old man.
U||Gavroche immediately began to take observations.
U||One of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with the other. Gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events. The bedroom had turned into a hiding-place at a very opportune moment.
U||Montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour, in such a place, betokened something threatening. Gavroche felt his gamin‚Äôs heart moved with compassion for the old man.
U||What was he to do? Interfere? One weakness coming to the aid of another! It would be merely a laughing matter for Montparnasse. Gavroche did not shut his eyes to the fact that the old man, in the first place, and the child in the second, would make but two mouthfuls for that redoubtable ruffian eighteen years of age.
U||While Gavroche was deliberating, the attack took place, abruptly and hideously. The attack of the tiger on the wild ass, the attack of the spider on the fly. Montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose, bounded upon the old man, seized him by the collar, grasped and clung to him, and Gavroche with difficulty restrained a scream. A moment later one of these men was underneath the other, groaning, struggling, with a knee of marble upon his breast. Only, it was not just what Gavroche had expected. The one who lay on the earth was Montparnasse; the one who was on top was the old man. All this took place a few paces distant from Gavroche.
U||The old man had received the shock, had returned it, and that in such a terrible fashion, that in a twinkling, the assailant and the assailed had exchanged r√¥les.
U||‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a hearty veteran!‚Äù thought Gavroche.
U||He could not refrain from clapping his hands. But it was applause wasted. It did not reach the combatants, absorbed and deafened as they were, each by the other, as their breath mingled in the struggle.
U||Silence ensued. Montparnasse ceased his struggles. Gavroche indulged in this aside: ‚ÄúCan he be dead!‚Äù
U||The goodman had not uttered a word, nor given vent to a cry. He rose to his feet, and Gavroche heard him say to Montparnasse:‚Äî
U||‚ÄúGet up.‚Äù
U||Montparnasse rose, but the goodman held him fast. Montparnasse‚Äôs attitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has been caught by a sheep.
U||Gavroche looked on and listened, making an effort to reinforce his eyes with his ears. He was enjoying himself immensely.
U||He was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of a spectator. He was able to catch on the wing a dialogue which borrowed from the darkness an indescribably tragic accent. The goodman questioned, Montparnasse replied.
U||‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúNineteen.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúYou are strong and healthy. Why do you not work?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúIt bores me.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúWhat is your trade?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúAn idler.‚Äù
U||‚ÄúSpeak seriously. Can anything be done for you? What would you like to be?‚Äù
U||‚ÄúA thief.‚Äù
